New book explores tertiary teaching of Japanese

  
A new book co-edited by University of Canterbury Lecturer in Japanese Dr Masayoshi Ogino gives unprecedented insight into issues and strategies around Japanese language learning and teaching in New Zealand at tertiary level.

_Creating New Synergies: Approaches of Tertiary Japanese Programmes in New Zealand_ is the first book to be published on Japanese language teaching in New Zealand universities and tertiary institutions.

Co-edited by Dr Ogino with Ms Dallas Nesbitt, AUT, and Dr Penny Shino, Massey University, it is a compilation of in-depth research into how the teaching of Japanese in the New Zealand tertiary sector is successfully adapting within a rapidly-changing and challenging learning environment.  
Although Japan remains steady as New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner, the number of secondary school and tertiary students learning the language has been dropping since the highs of the late 1980s and ’90s through the era of Japan’s ‘bubble economy’.

In the decade between 2005 and 2015 tertiary enrolments dropped by 48 per cent, and the decreasing number of Japanese language learners meant a reduction in courses offered. There is also competition from other languages being offered, especially Mandarin and Spanish.

The authors highlight that learning another language helps people develop a range of skills which add value to any career, including creativity, communication, interpersonal skills, flexibility and adaptability, self-awareness and confidence, and being attuned to diversity.

The authors agree that the formation of Japanese Studies Aotearoa New Zealand (JSANZ) in 2013 has fostered a strong sense of community between Japanese language teachers at all levels, and created opportunities for language learners to work together in dynamic settings.

“With JSANZ we have an active community who want to help others learn Japanese and also learn more about the Japanese culture. The popularity of contemporary Japanese culture through manga and anime also piques the imagination – just look at the number of people playing Pokémon Go,” says Dr Ogino.

In 2015 the Government committed $10 million over five years to the Asian Language Learning in Schools programme, to support the teaching of Asian languages in state and state-integrated schools. The authors are hopeful this will lead to increased learners in tertiary institutions.

Globally the numbers of Japanese language learners has increased and Dr Ogino says interest in Japan can only grow with the upcoming hosting of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan (the first time the tournament will be held in Asia), and the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.

“However, the Japanese language education we envisage for the future needs strong foundations and approaches which will endure beyond the short-lived allure of such events. We hope this book provides readers with innovative ideas, insights and inspiration for further developing additional language programmes, which will remain sustainable beyond 2020.”

Dr Ogino has extensive experience in language teaching in both New Zealand and overseas at secondary and tertiary levels. He has an M.Phil in Japanese Language Education and PhD in Applied Linguistics.
