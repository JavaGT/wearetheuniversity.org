Engineer who is researching critically ill patients named UC’s first Distinguished Professor

November 26, 2013

A mechanical engineering expert who is at the forefront of medical decision support research has become the first Distinguished Professor at the University of Canterbury (UC).

Professor Geoff Chase has just been appointed to the position after the University considered his outstanding research and teaching work.

The status and title of Distinguished Professor is reserved for professors who clearly demonstrate world-class academic leadership and achievements of the highest international standing over a decade or more.

Professor Chase’s research includes metabolic, pulmonary and cardiovascular research applied in intensive care units (ICUs) in New Zealand and overseas.

He said today he was honoured and proud to become the inaugural recipient of the Distinguished Professor title at UC.

\`\`I am pretty overwhelmed by being elevated to this promoted position. It’s not just great for UC but also for engineering as we look to an exciting future here.

\`\`The Government last month announced its $260 million support for UC, which means engineering here will receive a total facelift. As Christchurch rebuilds, this is the place in New Zealand to be learning and engaging in leading research.

\`\`I can’t wait for our new batch of students to come on board next year and find out how exciting it is here.

\`\`Meanwhile, I continue with a lot of research projects. I am the leader of an international research consortium funded by the European Union and the Royal Society of New Zealand doing research to apply engineering technology and innovation in collaboration with clinicians to improve healthcare.

Another student from his research group, Hamish Tomlinson, has just won a Rhodes Scholarship and was part of his teaching and final year project work in this area. Hamish follows on from two Fulbright scholars last year who are now studying at leading US universities.

\`\`As well as research at the intersection of engineering and medicine I am also engaged in research on structural dynamics and devices to mitigate earthquake damage, where our work with Dr Geoff Rodgers (UC) has seen these devices implemented in one of the first major new buildings erected downtown,’’ Professor Chase says.

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says Professor Chase’s world class medical research into supporting critically ill patients continues to help thousands of people, while his teaching passes that knowledge to future generations.

\`\`He is an example of why a strong research intensive University is of enormous benefit to the city and to the region. It is precisely these kind of people we must attract and retain to protect and enhance the reputation of the University,’’ Dr Carr says.

Pro-Vice Chancellor (Engineering) Professor Jan Evans-Freeman is thrilled the talents and achievements of Professor Chase have been recognised with the rare appointment.

\`\`Geoff is a wonderful example of how pure and applied research crosses boundaries and leads to clear societal benefits and this promotion puts the spotlight on engineering for the benefit of all.

\`\`His mechanical engineering research into helping critically ill patients will have widespread benefits for the New Zealand public.’’

Professor Chase received more than $650,000 of Health Research Council funding this year to help critically ill patients with respiratory failure recover. The work is critical as mechanical ventilation is a costly intensive care therapy affecting up to 50 percent of patients or around 8000 patients in New Zealand a year at a cost of $15 million per year.

Patients requiring mechanical ventilation stay in intensive care 70 percent longer and the cost is 140 percent more than other ICU patients. Better care will improve outcomes and reduce the cost to society.

\`\`Our research goal is to improve health outcomes for all New Zealanders as rising negative statistics for metabolic, cardiovascular and respiratory disease are not only major costs, but leading causes of ICU admission and mortality,’’ Professor Chase says.
