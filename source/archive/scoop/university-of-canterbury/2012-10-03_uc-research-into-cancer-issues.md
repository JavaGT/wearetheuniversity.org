UC research into cancer issues with the help of trust funding

October 3, 2012

University of Canterbury (UC) has begun researching whether breast cancer may be caused by a virus, whether colorectal cancer risk may be influenced by changes in diet, and whether people with head and neck cancer in Canterbury have access to appropriate support services.

The investigations are being carried out the UC’s Health Science Centre, with support from the Wayne Francis Charitable Trust.

UC’s Professor Ann Richardson said today breast cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. In New Zealand over 2700 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and over 600 women die from breast cancer each year.

Although it is possible to detect breast cancer early not enough is known to be able to prevent breast cancer, Professor Richardson said.

\`\`Previously our research has shown that breast cancer can be associated with a common virus in New Zealand and other countries. Our current research is designed to investigate this further, building on our previous findings. Identification of an infectious cause for breast cancer could lead to prevention of a significant proportion of breast cancer, for instance by immunisation in early childhood,’’ she said.

\`\`With regard to bowel cancer, Over 2800 men and women are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year in New Zealand. It is possible that dietary changes are associated with global changes in the incidence of bowel cancer.

\`\`Rapid increases in the incidence of bowel cancer in Japan and Hong Kong have been linked to dietary changes which have occurred in these countries over the last 50 years. One of the major dietary changes has been the intake of rice, which has declined significantly in both countries.

\`\`During this time, other countries with predominantly rice-based diets (such as China and India) did not experience the same declines in rice consumption, and have continued to have low incidence of bowel cancer. The possibility that rice is protective against bowel cancer is being investigated in partnership with international colleagues.’’

Christchurch Hospital staff and the Cancer Society have identified an increasing number of patients needing support services following treatment for head and neck cancers, and there is concern about whether these patients’ needs are being met,’’ Professor Richardson said.

Support services for patients with head and neck cancer and their families should include provision of information, speech therapy, pain relief, dental care, dietary advice, psychosocial support, and palliative care.

Because support services were provided by several disciplines and providers including secondary care, primary care, and NGO providers, coordination was essential. In New Zealand over 700 people are diagnosed with head and neck cancer per year.

This project will provide information on current support services for people with head and neck cancer in Canterbury, will identify strengths and limitations of the current services compared to international best-practice and local patients’ needs, and will support the development of a best-practice, evidence-based coordinated support service for people with head and neck cancer in Canterbury.

\`\`The Wayne Francis Cancer Epidemiology Group is ideally situated in the Health Sciences Centre at the UC. Over the last decade, the centre has seen an increasing number of students who have enrolled to undertake postgraduate studies in Health Sciences. The Health Sciences Centre also led the development of a new undergraduate qualification at UC; the Bachelor of Health Sciences, from next year.’’
