Strategic Partnership Agreement Signed Between the University of Canterbury and Industry New Zealand

The University of Canterbury is set to play a more active role in regional and national economic and business development as the result of a strategic partnership being signed with Industry New Zealand today.

The partnership agreement outlines how the University and Industry New Zealand will work together on economic development initiatives, support for businesses, and projects such as the recently-launched Human Interface Technology Laboratory of New Zealand.

The University wants to develop strong links with industry and broaden its research focus with increasing emphasis on applied research with commercial potential. It is also keen to play a role in regional leadership.

Industry New Zealand General Manager Southern Region Paul Claridge says Industry New Zealand sees the tertiary sector as enormously important if New Zealand's economic performance is to be improved.

"This is the first strategic partnership Industry New Zealand has signed with a university, and I am sure it won't be the last.

"Many of the children starting primary school today will work in industries that haven't been conceived yet. And some of our top companies in ten years time haven't been started yet.

"Those are hugely exciting challenges for us all. This strategic partnership will help Canterbury University build relationships with industry, and be more finely attuned to emerging business trends and developments.

"It will be a powerful driver for commercialisation of applied research occurring within the University.

"And if Industry New Zealand is serious about supporting our high growth potential businesses and propelling them into global markets, then we have to play a bigger role in guiding skills and talent development."

The Tertiary Education Commission and Industry New Zealand have also begun working closely together to secure better alignment between education and industry, Mr Claridge said.

Professor John Raine, the University's Pro Vice-Chancellor (International), welcomed the relationship with Industry New Zealand warmly and said it would be of key importance to the University.

"The University has developed a close working relationship with Industry New Zealand on initiatives to build industry-linked research capability. We've been assisted by Canterbury Development Corporation and all three parties are cooperating on projects that are aimed at promoting regional economic development.

"The Human Interface Technology Laboratory of New Zealand (HIT Lab NZ) and the proposed e-Security Lab are two very good examples. Both of these ventures will create new technology and will involve close collaboration with industry."

Examples of the strategic partnership working in action in addition to the HIT Lab NZ and e-Security laboratory, include establishing an internship programme allowing business students to work in local industry, collaboration between Industry New Zealand's Business Development Advisors and the University's commercialising arm, Canterprise, and linking the University with Industry New Zealand's sector research and strategies.

The signing ceremony is taking place at: Time: 8.30am Date: Friday 20 September 2002 Venue: University of Canterbury Registry, Vice-Chancellor's Office,
