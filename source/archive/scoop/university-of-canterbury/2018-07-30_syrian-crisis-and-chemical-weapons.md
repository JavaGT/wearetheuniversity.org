Syrian crisis and chemical weapons
==================================

**International law of war expert discusses Syrian crisis and chemical weapons**

International law of war expert Professor Tim McCormack will discuss the use of chemical weapons in Syria in a public talk at the University of Canterbury this week.

The New Zealand Law Foundation’s 2018 Distinguished Visiting Fellow, international humanitarian law expert Professor McCormack will be giving a public lecture – _Chemical Weapons and Other Atrocities: Contrasting Responses to the Syrian Crisis –_ on Thursday, 2 August, hosted by the UC Law School.

**Chemical Weapons and Other Atrocities**

“As the Syrian catastrophe lurches into its eighth year, the international community watches recurrent egregious atrocities unfold before our collective eyes,” Professor McCormack says.

“Apart from lethal force deployed against ISIS targets in Syria, the international community has been precluded from undertaking any substantive action against the Assad Regime – except in response to allegations of the use of chemical weapons.”

Professor McCormack will discuss the questions: What is it about chemical weapons that has evoked such outrage and facilitated US-Russian co-operation against Assad? Is it a particularly visceral reaction to the use of chemicals to kill or the manner in which people die? Is it a long-standing taboo against the use of chemicals as weapons of war? Or is there some more cynical explanation that has nothing to do with humanitarian concerns?
