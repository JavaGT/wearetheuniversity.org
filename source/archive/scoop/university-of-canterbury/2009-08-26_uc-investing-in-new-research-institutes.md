UC investing in new research institutes

The University of Canterbury is to make a multi-million dollar investment in new research institutes with the intention of raising its international profile and realising its world-class potential.

It is anticipated that the first two new institutes will be established next year, with the University calling now for expressions of interest from researchers.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the University is seeking to transform itself from a quality institution to one that is widely known and respected around the world by the time it reaches its 150th anniversary in 2023.

“The fact that most of the students who will be studying here by that time are already at school illustrates the need for us to progress our work with urgency.”

Dr Carr says the University would be failing its students and its staff if it did not aspire to be internationally known for what it does.

“I want to be able to go somewhere like New York, to stand in front of a whole lot of people, ask if any of them know about the University of Canterbury and hear them say that they do. This is the kind of recognition we need to be able to call ourselves world renowned, and this is what we are setting out to do.

“By establishing these new research institutes the University is creating opportunities for more New Zealanders to become internationally recognised and respected researchers.”

Dr Carr says the University is seeking expressions of interest from researchers in all fields.

“We are not pre-empting what kind of research our new institutes will be involved in. They just have to be good enough to rank among the best internationally.”

The new institutes, which will be research-driven and not dependent on commercial activities, will be centrally funded by the University for no less than three years during their establishment phases. The budgets will be finalised during the assessment and approval process but will be in the region of $1M per annum with an additional $250,000 in the first year for equipment and set-up costs.

Expressions of interest are now being sought with a deadline of 30 September.
