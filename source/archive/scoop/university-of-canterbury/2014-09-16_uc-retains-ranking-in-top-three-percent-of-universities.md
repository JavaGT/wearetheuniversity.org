UC retains ranking in top three percent of universities

  
The University of Canterbury has retained its ranking among the top three per cent of universities in the world.

In the latest QS World University Rankings released today Canterbury is listed as the 242nd ranked university in the world. There are about 17,000 universities worldwide. The university was ranked 333rd in the world in 2006 and has begun growing again as it rapidly rebuilds its facilities.

The University of Canterbury was New Zealand’s first university to achieve a QS five-star rating and this has been retained. The University features among the world’s elite (top 200) universities in 16 subjects in the latest QS world university rankings by subject. Out of 3000 universities, UC is rated in the top 100 in History, Geography, Law and Education, and Civil and Structural Engineering.

Its employer reputation is assessed at 173rd in the world. The employer reputation indicator is based on a global survey, taking in 28,000 responses. The survey gives students a better sense of how universities are viewed in the job market.

The international faculty ratio where Canterbury is ranked 30th assesses how international a university is, by measuring the proportion of international students and faculty members in relation to overall numbers.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the university’s focus on employability and entrepreneurship builds on a strength already observed by employers in New Zealand and overseas.

“Not only are we a research-intensive university but we can rightly claim to be one of the most international universities in the world according to this measure.

“For the university to retain its position in the top three per cent is a credit to the quality and commitment of staff considering the impact of the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

“ Today we have more than 14,000 students, a record number of new and continuing PhD students, nearly 2000 full time equivalent staff and have offered over 1200 courses this year.

\`\`The university received more Fulbright scholarship awards this year than any other New Zealand tertiary institution. It has the highest proportion of students completing qualifications and the highest proportion of students progressing to higher levels of study of any New Zealand university, according to the Tertiary Education Commission.

\`\`We are moving forward as a community and projecting that spirit. The regeneration of Christchurch, in which the University is investing significantly, has really begun. This result is an exciting and an endorsement of the purposeful direction we are taking,’’ Dr Carr says.

Ends.
