UC approves 190 summer research scholarships

August 30, 2012

A total of 190 projects have been awarded University of Canterbury (UC) summer research scholarships, each valued at $5000, to appoint senior students to work on specific research projects under the supervision of UC academic staff members for 10 weeks over the summer period.

More than 450 project applications were submitted by academics for the scholarships to support a student.

Each scholar will also give a short presentation on their project at the end of the scheme, on February 8 next year.

UC Professor Lucy Johnston said the purpose of summer research scholarships was to give senior students, normally in their final undergraduate year or honours year, experience in research, to encourage them to pursue postgraduate study.

\`\`Previous summer students have found that the research experience improved their confidence about undertaking postgraduate studies and in many cases directed them to a potential supervisor and project. It is important to students in terms of getting hands-on research experience and general research skills,’’ Professor Johnston said.

About 130 of the projects are co-funded with external partners including Ag Research, Antarctic NZ, Canterbury Medical Research Fund, Cawthorn Institute, Downer, Dynamic Controls, ESR, Genesis Energy, McKenzie Trust, NIWA, NZ Cricket, Royal Society, Rutherford Fellowship, Scion, Solid Energy, Tait Electronics and UNESCO.
