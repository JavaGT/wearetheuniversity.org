**UC hosts EU Security Union Commissioner to speak on hate crime, terrorism**

The European Union’s Commissioner for the Security Union, Sir Julian Beresford King KCVO CMG will present the annual National Centre for Research on Europe’s (NCRE) prestigious Europa Lecture at the University of Canterbury on Thursday 27 June. He will be speaking about ‘The Christchurch Call – bringing the conversation home’, along with New Zealand MPs Golriz Ghahraman and Gerry Brownlee.

Following the devastating 15 March mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President Emmanuel Macron met, alongside other world and tech leaders, to adopt the ‘Christchurch Call’. The Christchurch Call aims to combat online terrorism and violent extremism. The European Commission was a major supporter of the Call, alongside eight EU member states.

The New Zealand Government has invited Sir Julian to the country as part of growing security connections following the Christchurch terrorist attacks. He will cover topics such as hate crime, cyberterrorism and radicalisation.

“The visit of Commissioner Sir Julian King builds on the 2016 NZ-EU Political Agreement and comes at a time of deepening relations as reflected in the current negotiations towards a Free Trade Agreement,” says Professor Martin Holland, Director of the NCRE at UC.
