Marketing internship projects to be showcased

  
Four top cases studies from Canterbury University’s highly successful marketing internship programme will be showcased at a symposium hosted jointly with the Canterbury Employers’ Chamber of Commerce in Christchurch tomorrow night.

The internship programme was introduced last summer in partnership with 25 companies covering a range of fields from wine and electronics to cheese and advertising.

Programme Director Dr Robert Peffers, of UC’s Department of Management, described the programme as a “win-win” for companies and students alike. “While students get the marketing experience, companies have marketing activities done that might not otherwise be completed.”

The four projects being showcased on Wednesday cover four quite varied business areas. They are Value Plus Homes, who were assisted with re-branding the company; Forrest Estate Wines, where the project examined opportunities to move into the Asian market; Harvey Cameron Advertising, where different advertising applications in different industries were examined; and Allied Telesyn, where the project focused on the introduction on new internal marketing techniques.

The students were employed full-time for between six and eight weeks and during that time maintained a diary of activities. At the end of the project they were required to give a presentation to the company and to Dr Peffers. The students get six points of university credit for successfully completing the internship assignment.

The symposium, at Bellamy's in the Provincial Chambers, will be presented to representatives from the top 50 Canterbury businesses.
