Sir Graham is one of UC’s and the College of Education’s most distinguished graduates. He is well known internationally and nationally as head coach of the All Blacks from 2004 to 2011. He has been described as one of the most successful coaches ever to have coached an All Blacks side.

His contributions to education, sports coaching and to New Zealand have been recognised at the highest levels through his OBE.

He attended Christchurch Boys’ High School and later earned a Teachers Diploma in physical education and science at the former Christchurch College of Education, now the UC College of Education.

He went on to teach at Christchurch Boys’ High School, Auckland Grammar School (where he coached the 1st XV) and Kelston Boys’ High School; and was later appointed as Kelston headmaster in 1987 until taking up rugby coaching fulltime in 1996.
