**University of Canterbury appoints new Vice-Chancellor**

Professor Cheryl de la Rey, currently the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Pretoria, has been appointed as the new Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canterbury, University Chancellor Dr John Wood announced today.

Professor de la Rey will commence the role in mid-February, replacing Dr Rod Carr, who has served two five year terms.

Dr Wood said the University had undertaken a global recruitment process and had been thrilled with the calibre of a large pool of domestic and international applicants. The Vice-Chancellor Appointment Committee, led by Pro-Chancellor Sue McCormack, made a recommendation to appoint Professor de la Rey at a public excluded University Council meeting on 21 May, which was accepted unanimously.

“Professor de la Rey is an exceptional candidate to lead the University. She has a significant international profile and a strong research reputation in her chosen field of psychology, and in research leadership and governance. She also brings extensive experience and demonstrated management ability from a range of tertiary education roles in South Africa, which I know she is looking forward to bringing to New Zealand.

“She is known as a visionary strategic thinker and has a track record for opening University pathways to priority and other learners. Her overall approach is a very good fit with the graduate attributes the University seeks to instil in all its students.

“Professor de la Rey will begin at UC with the University’s post-quake transformation well advanced, its extensive capital works programme almost complete, world-class redeveloped and new facilities open for teaching, initiatives to build student numbers beyond pre-quake levels well in hand, and the University community very much focused on providing what it always has – world-class research-led teaching and learning,” Dr Wood said.

“I’m honoured to be selected for this position and thank the University of Canterbury Council for its vote of confidence. I look forward to using my skills and experience and to build on the good work of my predecessor,” Professor de la Rey said.

Dr Wood said outgoing Vice-Chancellor Dr Carr had made an immense contribution to the University since first taking the role in 2009.

“We couldn’t have known at the time but, post-quake, having a Vice-Chancellor with Rod’s particular expertise in business, finance and risk has been invaluable in leading the University through the most challenging time in its history. His leadership of its recovery, transformation and contribution to the University’s future success cannot be overstated.”
