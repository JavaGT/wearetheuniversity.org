RDU returns to its roots with new lunch show

There's something new on the lunch menu in Christchurch, an option for those hungering for more local fare.

It's called The Canterbury Lunch and it's being served up for your listening pleasure by RDU on 98.5 FM, from 1 to 2pm weekdays during term time.

Hosted by Jo Cramond the new show will focus on matters central and peripheral to student life at Canterbury University. It will feature interviews with students, academics, politicians and alumni and let listeners know about events happening on campus.

The show will get into full swing when lectures resume after the first term break on 1 May.

Jo, the woman behind the microphone, is a 21-year-old journalism student. She hails from Dunedin where she did a four-year anthropology honours degree at Otago University. She is no stranger to the airwaves having been a volunteer presenter for student radio station Radio 1 for three of her scarfie years.

Station manager Andrew “Hat” Meier says The Canterbury Lunch is part of a package of initiatives to reconnect RDU with the University and it students, which includes encouraging cafes on campus to tune into 98.5FM.

“I think the concept of making something new with an emphasis on uni' life is something people are ready for and we are ready to deliver.

“The tag 'student station' was loaded with negative connotations for so long that RDU was conscious of the need to be an urban station as well as a student station to enable it to grow. But now we have a strong core and are established enough as an urban station to bring ourselves back to our roots which are in university life.”
