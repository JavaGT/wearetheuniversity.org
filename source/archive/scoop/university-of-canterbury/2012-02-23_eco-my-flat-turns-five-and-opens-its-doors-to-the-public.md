Eco-my-flat turns five and opens its doors to the public
========================================================

**Eco-my-flat turns five and opens its doors to the public**

Eco-my-flat the competition where students eco their lives is packing its (organic, home-grown) lunch in its (second-hand) back pack, pulling up its socks and getting ready for the next big adventure – a new era of the competition.

In celebration of eco-my-flat’s fifth year, the University of Canterbury’s Sustainability Office has introduced a few changes.

Eco-my-flat coordinator Dr Sharon McIver said that the ‘competition’ tag has been dropped and instead they have decided to go with the direction Christchurch is heading in - an eco-my-flat community open event.

“Eco-my-flat will not only be open to students and staff at the University, but to anyone willing to share their experiences of trying to become more sustainable,” she said.

“And, in the hope of making eco-my-flat the most desirable location on the web, we’ve added a Facebook page where flats, sponsors, media, whānau, and fans will be able to share resources and, most importantly, tell everyone about what they’re doing to make life more eco.”

Eco-my-flat runs from March to May and is one of the many initiatives to highlight issues around sustainability and, hopefully, prompt a better environmentally friendly lifestyle choice said Dr McIver.

“The competition is very popular and we have seen some brilliant initiatives over the years. One year students produced electricity from a flat exercycle and a DIY wind generator. Others include the wonders of white vinegar and baking soda.”

A number of prizes will be available and spot prizes will be given away online. Participants are required to write blogs and the spot prizes will be awarded during the blogging.

“The blogs are great way for people to get tips and advice from those who are participating. We want everyone to gain something from eco-my-flat, be it preserving, baking or bubble wrapping hallway windows.”

People wishing to know more about eco-my-flat can simply ‘like’ it on Facebook, or phone, email, post or visit the UC Sustainability Office at Sustainability House, 118 Ilam Road.

“Join eco-my-flat and become a part of the friendliest, generous, most sustainable flat in town,” Dr McIver said.

Eco-my-flat will also be holding workshops during the competition that anyone is welcome to attend.

Workshops will take place on Wednesdays, 5-6pm, at Sustainability House, 118 Ilam Road. All prospective attendees must register by signing up at: http://www.sustain.canterbury.ac.nz/ecomyflat/form.shtml .
