English classes to prepare students for academic studies at the University of Canterbury (UC) are now being offered by CCEL, the English language school partner located on the UC campus, Assistant Vice-Chancellor Hamish Cochrane said today.

English language will not be offered by UC from early 2013, all English language pathway to UC courses will be offered in partnership with CCEL.

Students currently studying English language courses at UC may continue to complete their courses at UC; however, after next week there would be no new starters Dr Cochrane said.

This new programme, English for Academic Purposes: Pathway to UC, is a collaborative project based on the teaching and moderation expertise of both institutions to prepare students for success in their tertiary studies at UC.

For the past several years CCEL has been providing high quality general English courses which have prepared international students to transfer into UC’s bridging programmes.

This is an attractive direct pathway programme and put together with a joint UC and CCEL international marketing push it will see a return to steady growth in international student numbers, according to Rob McKay, Managing Director of CCEL.

UC has an excellent degree programme reputation and the NZ Qualifications Authority has given CCEL its highest possible performance rating. According to Rob McKay it makes for a very strong and internationally attractive partnership.

By having the English for Academic Purposes: Pathway to UC programme taught at CCEL, the partnership will provide a seamless and smooth transition for our students as they go on to their degree programmes at UC.

Both institutions were confident working together on the programme, would not only provide the same high academic quality and learning objectives as in other programmes, but would ensure that the high standards of quality that both partners had always strived for would continue to be maintained, Dr Cochrane said.
