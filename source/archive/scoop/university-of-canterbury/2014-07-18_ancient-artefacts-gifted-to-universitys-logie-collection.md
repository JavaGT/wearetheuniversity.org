Ancient artefacts gifted to university’s Logie Collection

July 18, 2014

An ancient Greek mug, dated about 330-320BC, has been gifted to the University of Canterbury’s James Logie Memorial Collection.

The mug is one of seven precious artefacts from ancient Egypt, Greece and Mesopotamia that have been donated to the university by the PhiloLogie Society and Diane Coulbeck, a daughter of the late Maxwell Coulbeck, a Christchurch antiquities collector.

The Logie Collection is one of the finest teaching collections of Greek and Roman antiquities in the southern hemisphere. The collection includes Greek and Roman artefacts, with pieces from Ancient Egypt, as well as a small collection of Greek and Roman coins. It spans artefacts over more than 2500 years from about 2000 BC.

The collection is housed in the university’s classics department and has been fully conserved following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. It is safely stored in museum-quality cabinets and is open to the public, by appointment. It is used for teaching, learning and researching at the university.

Logie Collection co-curators Penny Minchin-Garvin and Terri Elder say the new additions will add to the status of the Logie collection.

When the newly donated antiquities have been fully documented, they will feature online on the Logie webpages at www.arts.canterbury.ac.nz/logi
