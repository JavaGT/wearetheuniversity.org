1 nation, 2 days, 6 cities, 40 signs of change

**1 nation, 2 days, 6 cities, 40 signs of change**

Modern technology is enabling 400 people in six cities to attend a national conference on emerging sustainability, without the need for travelling out of town or finding accommodation.

The Signs of Change national e-conference, is designed to provide the beneficial aspects of gathering to learn, present and discuss a topic, while reducing the negative impacts of travel, namely expense, time and emissions. It will be hosted in Christchurch on 15-16 November 2010 with live connections to venues in Dunedin, Wellington, Hamilton, Palmerston North and Auckland.

The conference is the brain-child of Associate Professor Susan Krumdieck, from the University of Canterbury’s Department of Mechanical Engineering.

“I was going to go to an international conference on sustainability in Europe, but it was going to be the same old thing – we must reduce our emissions, we must switch to renewables, we must get new economic theories – blah blah. I had the idea that with the funds I would have spent for one academic to go to one overseas conference I could host a national conference about a new direction.”

Dr Krumdieck put her idea to the Engineers for Social Responsibility and they agreed to support the event as their national conference. A network of academics volunteered time to work with their universities and IT specialists to set up the conference.

“The new HD323 bridge technology will be used for the first time to host a public event. The technology will allow participants in lecture theatres in six cities to see the speaker and view the PowerPoint slides from another city,” said Professor Krumdieck.

“The robust national dialogue via modern technology will be a sign of change in itself. There will also be locally made videos aired and discussion groups.”

“We are expecting at least 400 participants from around the country with an emissions savings of 22 tonnes of CO2 by attending locally while participating nationally,” she said.  
The theme of the conference is _Signs of Change_ and will showcase 40 presentations of fundamental change in a wide variety of contexts.

“We have not invited international experts to tell us how big the problems are, and what we must do – most of which we can’t do. The problems of unsustainable use of resources and impacts on the environment have been discussed at length in many forums. This national conference is a showcase for changes that are already emerging in a sustainable direction. We will learn about the future by hearing short reports from New Zealanders from all walks of life who are exploring in a positive direction.”

  
Professor Krumdieck said the conference was aimed at anyone who wants to know about initiatives in sustainability including engineers, scientists, business people, council workers, educators, students, health workers and farmers.

“The conference provides an opportunity to make connections, share ideas, and learn what others are doing.”

Professor Krumdieck said the conference organizers will be seeking feedback from participants and some of that information will be used in a research report about running an e-conference.

Registrations are now open and more information can be found on the conference website (www.signsofchange.org.nz) which Professor Krumdieck said cost the equivalent of two night’s accommodation in Vienna.
