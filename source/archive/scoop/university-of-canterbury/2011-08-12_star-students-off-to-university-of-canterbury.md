STAR students off to University of Canterbury

  
STAR students amongst first to achieve preferential entry to University of Canterbury

Thirty-four secondary school students from around Christchurch are amongst the first to achieve preferential entry to the University of Canterbury.

The students recently completed a STAR course at UC with 65 per cent of the group achieving A-range grades. To acknowledge this success a presentation was made to the STAR high achievers.

"High-achieving students take extension courses across a range of subjects at UC as part of our STAR programme," said Academic Quality Assurance Manager, Heather Dickie. "Their studies help them to transition to tertiary study and to extend the breadth and depth of their learning. Students can take subjects that might not be on offer at their school, such as psychology, or develop their learning in particular subject areas such as maths or economics.

"We were pleased to be able to advise this group of students that in addition to achieving excellent grades they were now eligible for preferential entry to UC because they had completed a STAR course here."

The University of Canterbury is introducing preferential entry for students intending to study at the University next year and beyond. For the first time Year 12 secondary school students will have an opportunity to use their NCEA Level 2 results (or their equivalent) to secure a scholarship and preferential entry to the University of Canterbury, providing they go on to gain University Entrance.

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr said that the new initiatives are being introduced to encourage and reward sustained achievement at secondary and tertiary level.

"We are committed to delivering a high-quality education at UC. As a result of the introduction of preferential entry and the significantly increased scholarship funding that is now on offer, students who are doing well at Year 12 will be able to plan for their continuing education at the University of Canterbury with more certainty and Year 13 students will have a clear goal to aim for as they prepare to transition from secondary to tertiary study."

Dr Carr commended the group of STAR students who had completed their course with such distinction.

"I offer the students my congratulations both because of their high level of achievement and because they have dealt so well with disruptions to their studies during semester one. We look forward to welcoming them to UC should they choose to pursue their undergraduate studies here with us."

"Students and their parents or caregivers can be assured that achievement will be rewarded both in terms of securing a place at UC and in terms of scholarship funding. We wish to encourage the sustained and long-term success of the best and brightest students as they pursue their studies at the University of Canterbury."
