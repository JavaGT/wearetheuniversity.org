**Sir Robertson Stewart Scholarship recipient has forest nutrient cycles in her sights**  
   
**July 14, 2013**  
   
University of Canterbury (UC) biological sciences postgraduate student Olivia Johnston has received the Sir Robertson Stewart Scholarship for 2013.  
   
Johnston will use the scholarship for her Masters research on nutrient cycles in forest ecosystems.  
   
\`\`My research may reveal differences between the nitrogen and carbon cycles in logged and unlogged forests and between present forests and those before human settlement. The results may be used to inform conservation management so as to reduce modification to our fragile natural environment now and in the future.  
   
\`\`I am using measurements of stable isotopes in leaves to compare the cycles within forests and how they vary with such factors as height above the forest floor, and between forests on the East and West Coasts of the South Island.  
   
\`\`Understanding such differences is important as it underpins other forest studies and contributes to the existing pool of data on nutrient cycling within these ecosystems.  
   
\`\`The research is part of on-going research at UC, in collaboration with other researchers, on the changes to the New Zealand environment resulting from human activities.   
   
\`\`Earlier this year I completed field work on the West Coast and in Riccarton Bush, and have finished processing leaf samples in the laboratory. The measurements will be made in the stable isotope lab at UC’s Department of Geological Sciences.  
   
\`\`New Zealand forests are important environments for much of our unique fauna and we need to understand the nutrient cycles to help prevent further degradation of these fragile ecosystems.  
   
\`\`Since the arrival of humans to New Zealand, forests and the ecosystem processes within them have changed, especially as a result of economic activities such as farming and forestry.  
   
\`\`The extent of these impacts must be studied so that damage can be limited and to inform measures aimed at rehabilitating these natural areas,’’ Johnston says.   
   
The Sir Robertson Stewart scholarship was established in 2010 from a bequest made to the University of Canterbury Foundation Trust from the estate of Sir Robertson Stewart to support students and teaching staff.
