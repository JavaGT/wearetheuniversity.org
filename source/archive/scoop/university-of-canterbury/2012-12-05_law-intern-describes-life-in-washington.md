One significant difference between Christchurch and Washington DC, says UC intern

December 5, 2012

A University of Canterbury (UC) law intern Seamus Woods who is on a trip of a lifetime working on Capitol Hill, in Washington DC, says there is one significant difference between working there and being a student in Christchurch.

\`\`There are security checks each time you come into the Congressional Offices and the guards are armed,’’ Seamus Wood said from Washington DC today.

His internship, along fellow UC law student Rachael Harris was jointly funded by the University of Canterbury (UC) and the Washington based US-NZ Council. The programme is geared to exposing UC interns to the workings of the US political system and to benefit particular members and committees of the US Congress.

The internship programme, to foster greater understanding of the American legislative system, was announced at the New Zealand Embassy in Washington DC on the first anniversary of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.

\`\`I am working at Congress in representative Kevin Brady's office. Rep. Brady represents the 8th District of Texas. Interns operate the front desk of the office, fielding constituent calls and mail, giving tours and the occasional research for the legislative team. I have met the Congressman,’’ Woods said.

Woods said he will soon be helping the legislative team with research. When he returns to New Zealand next month, he will begin work in Wellington at the Court of Appeal as a research clerk for Justice Ellen France.

\`\`The trip is an incredibly valuable experience to grow my skills, meet countless amazing people and see one of the great cities of the world. I am extremely grateful to UC for the opportunity to participate in this programme. It is such an outstanding experience and one that has made me very pleased to be a UC student.’’

President of the United States - New Zealand Council William Maroni said the US and New Zealand could learn from each other by offering outstanding UC students the opportunity to experience first-hand the American legislative process and promote greater understanding between both nations.
