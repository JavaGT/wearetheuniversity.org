Jade Software Corporation joins University of Canterbury’s ICT Innovation Institute

Christchurch-based Jade Software Corporation is to make a significant investment in the University of Canterbury’s new multi-million dollar Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Innovation Institute.

The Institute will link the University’s research capabilities with industry needs and increase the supply of ICT-based ideas and start-up companies.

Jade Software Corporation’s commitment will fund what will be known as the JADE Foundation, which will operate within the new ICT Innovation Institute.

The JADE Foundation will develop research and teaching projects and provide scholarships for PhD students. The JADE Foundation and UC have already identified potential research project topics.

UC Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp says the arrangement with Jade is an excellent example of how the ICT Innovation Institute will develop mutually beneficial partnerships between the University and the ICT sector.

“We have great hopes for this partnership with Jade, one of Christchurch’s and indeed New Zealand’s ICT success stories. It is exactly the kind of arrangement we envisaged when we set-out to establish the ICT Innovation Institute.

“It will allow us to do research we know will be of real benefit to the sector and produce the kind of graduate the sector really needs.”

The Managing Director of Jade Software Corporation, Dr Rod Carr, says “Jade is highly committed to the education sector. Tertiary institutions teach JADE and we have created a student administration system that has been implemented in a number of institutions. Through the JADE Foundation we are seeking to further collaborate and extend our involvement and research activity in the sector especially in the further development of our world class technology.”

Plans for the purpose-built research facility are well advanced after a successful multi-million dollar bid for funding from the Government’s Partnerships for Excellence Scheme.

The scheme was established to enhance innovation, encourage greater private sector investment in tertiary education and to foster relationships between tertiary institutions, business and industry.

A fundraising programme is currently underway to match the $9.7 million awarded through the scheme, which makes contributions on the proviso that matching funding is secured from other sources. The Christchurch City Council has also provided underwriting support.
