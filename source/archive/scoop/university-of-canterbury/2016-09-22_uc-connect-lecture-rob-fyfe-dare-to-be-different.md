In an upcoming UC Connect public lecture, Icebreaker chief executive and University of Canterbury alumni and honorary doctorate recipient Rob Fyfe will share his experience leading three very different companies over the last 15 years, his unique approach to change, his successes and failures, and his perspective on risk taking.

One of New Zealand’s most influential business leaders, Rob has had a varied business career over the last 40 years, both in New Zealand and internationally. Born and raised in Christchurch, Rob left Burnside High School to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force and complete an honours degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Canterbury.

He then progressed through a range of roles in the banking, telecommunications, television, airline industries, and now in the outdoor apparel industry.

He is best known for his involvement with two iconic New Zealand brands; Air New Zealand and Icebreaker. As well as being the current CEO and a Director of Icebreaker, Rob is on the Boards of Michael Hill International, Antarctica New Zealand and the Asia New Zealand Foundation and is a strategic advisor to Craggy Range Wines.

In 2015 the University of Canterbury awarded Rob an Honorary Doctorate of Commerce.
