Clever Tactix to excel at sport and study at UC

**Clever Tactix to excel at sport and study at UC**

There are not one but two professional sportswomen in the 2016 Mainland Tactix team simultaneously studying at the University of Canterbury, while excelling at international netball. They describe how they find the balance between their sporting and academic ambitions:

**Olivia Coughlan** was offered an Emerging Leaders Scholarship to study at the University of Canterbury in 2013 and recently returned from a university exchange to France. Olivia joined the Tactix team this year for her full ANZ Championship (ANZC) debut season. Standing at 1.88m-tall, Olivia adds extra height to the defensive circle.

Away from the netball court, Olivia is completing a double degree at the University of Canterbury –Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of Arts majoring in Media, Communications and French – and recently returned from a semester studying in Aix-en-Provence in France.

**Has it been hard to juggle sport and study?**

Yes it is difficult, but it’s just a matter of good time management and studying efficiently. For example, if I only have two hours to study, then I need to make sure that I get everything done in that two hours that I need to do without getting off task. I also can’t stay up all night studying for a test when I have training early in the morning the next day because I don’t want to compromise my performance. I just make sure that I get on to my study early enough to complete it well before its due and this helps to reduce stress around assessments so I can focus on my netball.

**How does UC help you manage the balance?**

Studying is a great way for me to take my mind off netball and extend myself in other aspects of my life. UC understands my commitments outside of uni and are flexible around my study.

**What do you think of the campus?**

I love the uni campus – it’s a vibrant place and always buzzing with activities. The library is a great environment and I am always keen to meet my friends there for a coffee and study date.

**Would you recommend UC?**

Yes I would definitely recommend UC - I really enjoy all the courses that I have done within my BA/LLB so far and I think that this helps me to achieve academically. The environment at UC is very comfortable and there is always lots going on with clubs and events, I have met so many new and interesting people through the university and it is a great place to study.

**Hayley Saunders** is studying at UC for a Degree in Social Work and also gives coaching sessions for young aspiring Tactix players. She returns for her third season with the Tactix after previously playing for the Southern Steel and Northern Mystics. She will lead the Tactix midcourt in her role at WD.

Hayley moved to Christchurch after the earthquakes. She enjoys the balance of exploring the outdoors plus the growing city hub, full of the excitement and buzz of new things. She says of Christchurch: “It’s home for me now”.

**Has it been hard to juggle sport and study?**

I’ve definitely had to become more organised. It's taught me to think ahead; something as simple as packing your bag for five different things the next day. But it's definitely doable. UC makes it achievable.

**How does UC help you manage the balance?**

I'm in the Social Work department, and they’re super understanding. They know that I’ll do what’s expected of me and come to everything I possibly can. In return they might record a lecture for me, or give me an extension if I've been away for a week.

**What do you think of the campus?**

Really great; it's integrated, there’s a great community feel and sense of cohesion. There are a lot of social opportunities too. I find that the atmosphere here puts me in the right frame of mind for learning. Being around like-minded people and having facilities, like the library and study rooms, allows me to stay focused on my studies.

**Would you recommend UC?**

Definitely, especially for people like me, who are into their sport. Here you can integrate everything, you don’t have make sacrifices. They make it easy at UC.

**_In their first home game, the Tactix will play the Mystics on Anzac Day,Monday 25 April, at Horncastle Arena, Christchurch. More info on their website: www.tactix.org.nz_**
