University of Canterbury Update

A week on from last weekend’s earthquake, University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr has acknowledged the resilience and outstanding efforts of the university community as it comes to terms and responds to this significant event.

“As Vice-Chancellor I have been incredibly proud of our emergency response personnel, our academic staff who have shared their knowledge with the people of Christchurch to help them make sense of what has happened, our staff who have helped with this week’s working bees and our students who have done so much to show their commitment to our local community.

“While we had initially hoped to be fully operational again by Monday, it became apparent to us during the course of the week that our staff and students deserved more time to recover emotionally. We cannot underestimate the impact this event will have had on us all and it is in all our interests to give ourselves another week to come to terms with what has happened and the recovery ahead of us.

“On Monday we will welcome staff back to campus. On Wednesday students will return ahead of teaching resuming on Monday 20 September. The Early Childhood Learning Centre and the UCSA Childcare Centre will be open from Monday. However, because of additional contractor activity and general clean-up work we would advise that children are not brought on to campus.”

The University has planned a number of forums for next week to provide details of its re-start planning. Details of the additional e-book, digital journal and digital database resources that have become available to the University community, and how staff and students can access them, will be outlined at the forums.

The forums will also provide information on support services that are available to staff and students, including assistance available for students who may be experiencing hardship. Also staff and students will be updated on the impact of the earthquake on learning content and examination timetabling.

Dr Carr says while the University had initially indicated that by Monday the University would provide further information on the impact of the earthquake on the study break and examination timetable, it will now be announcing an update by 5pm on Tuesday 14 September.

As previously advised, assignments and tests will be due two weeks later than the originally published date. The one exception is that final assessments will still be due no later than 15 October. The College of Education will communicate separately to students on final due dates.

“Thank you again for your support. We are looking forward to having you back on campus next week.”

ENDS.
