**Lack Of Accommodation A Major Constraint To The Rebuild, UC Research Finds**  
  
**April 10 2013**

A lack of accommodation for construction workers is likely to be a major constraint to the rebuilding of Christchurch, University of Canterbury (UC) research has found.

The study was headed by UC’s Dr Erica Seville, co-leader of UC’s Resilient Organisations research programme.

Christchurch and Canterbury suffered significant housing losses due to the earthquakes. Earthquake Commission estimates have suggested more than 150,000 homes, or around three quarters of Christchurch housing stock, sustained damage from the earthquakes.

Some areas of Christchurch have been declared unsuitable for rebuilding, affecting more than 7500 residential properties.

\`\`International experience, together with our Christchurch case studies, have suggested these pressures may create a ripple effect in Christchurch,’’ Dr Seville says.

\`\`Competing demand for temporary accommodation is likely to contribute to post-disaster inflation. If post-disaster inflation gets too high, it can hinder economic recovery.

\`\`Demand for housing from construction workers is likely to compound the shortage of houses available to residents displaced by the earthquakes.

\`\`The need for single-stay accommodation of temporary workers has largely been met by Christchurch’s hotel and motel facilities as well as boarding houses.

\`\`Housing individual workers has been manageable but costly. The real concern is the availability of suitable and affordable housing for workers with families.

\`\`Our study suggests that there is a need for increased supply of affordable rental properties and a more flexible design of interim housing solutions, which can be closely linked with other economic activities and generate a sense of stability to speed up disaster recovery,’’ Dr Seville says.

There is a need for increased supply of affordable rental properties and a more flexible design of interim housing solutions.

\`\`Developing a large temporary housing programme for workers can be complex, expensive and technical; and there may be significant logistical, legal and political hurdles.

\`\`Interim solutions need to be fast, cost-effective and benefiting other groups of people throughout its lifecycle. This is, however, what is needed in Christchurch. The imminent need for construction workers to support the rebuild means that interim housing and affordable rental properties are needed as soon as possible,’’ Dr Seville says.  
The study was jointly undertaken by UC and University of Auckland researchers, through UC’s Resilient Organisations research programme, which is co-lead by Dr Seville. The study also collaborated with the Building Research Association of New Zealand and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
