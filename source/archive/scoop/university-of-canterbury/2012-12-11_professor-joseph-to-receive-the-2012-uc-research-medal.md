Professor Joseph to receive the 2012 UC Research Medal

December 11, 2012

University of Canterbury (UC) law professor, Philip Joseph, will receive the 2012 Research Medal at a UC graduation ceremony tomorrow.

Professor Joseph has an international reputation in the fields of constitutional and administrative law, also known as public law.

He was promoted to the rank of Professor in 2001 and has produced approximately 150 publications during his academic career.

His most influential publication is his sole authored text “Constitutional and Administrative Law in New Zealand”. The first edition published in 1993 took six years to complete. The second edition was published in 2001 and the third edition, published in 2007, runs to more than 130 pages. A fourth edition is being prepared.

This text on Constitutional and Administrative law is relied upon by the legal profession and the courts in New Zealand and is regularly cited in the courts in all common law countries especially Australia, Canada, UK and the Pacific Islands.

Professor Joseph has won the JF Northey Memorial Book Award and the Sir Ian Barker Published Article Award - both of these awards are for the best article or text published by a New Zealand – based legal academic. He has been awarded a Rutherford Visiting Scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge and in 2004 was conferred the higher degree Doctor of Laws by the University of Canterbury.

Justice John Fogarty of the High Court said Professor Joseph was regarded as “not only the author of the authoritative textbook but also as the leading scholar in New Zealand on Public Law”.

The Dean of Law at the University of Auckland, Professor Mark Henaghan, said Professor Joseph’s research covers every aspect of how New Zealand is governed in Parliament, the Courts and all other branches of Government.

\`\`His work analyses the really important debate about the nature of the Treaty of Waitangi and where it fits in our constitutional framework. It is the breadth and depth of this work that makes it unique. It is a massive contribution to the wellbeing of New Zealand’s legal system.”

Professor Sir Jeffrey Jowell, Director of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law in London, said Professor Joseph was one of the leading public law scholars in the common law world today.
