University of Canterbury picks an upswing in 2016 local enrolments

The University of Canterbury is picking an increase in new to UC students from the Canterbury region in 2016 if feedback from schools, recruitment events and applications to enrol are anything to go by, Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says.

“Feedback from students, teachers, and recruitment events locally has been very positive,” Dr Carr says. “It appears significantly more Year 13 students than in recent years are keen to stay in Christchurch and study locally. A recovery that is clearly gathering momentum is an obvious factor. We believe that the proportion of Year 13 Canterbury students planning to study at UC in 2016 is heading back to pre-quake levels.

“Inevitably, cost is also a consideration, and that will have an impact on some students’ ability to study elsewhere, but any student choosing UC gets world-class learning opportunities with world-class academics, and the international viewpoints of many of our visiting academics, as well as the opportunity to study abroad for a semester.

“Of course, those in the know, who’ve been at UC for the last few years, know that UC has a vibrant student atmosphere and a positive student culture. UC’s more than 130 student clubs is by far the most of any New Zealand university – UC students have got on with it and made their own fun. All indications are that UC will continue to be all of that in 2016 and beyond”.
