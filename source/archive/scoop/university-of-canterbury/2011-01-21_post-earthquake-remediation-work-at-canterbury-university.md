Post-earthquake remediation work at Canterbury University

Post-earthquake remediation work at the University of Canterbury

Scaffolding will start to be erected around parts of the University of Canterbury (UC)’s James Hight Building and Central Library from Monday (**subs 24 January**) so that post-earthquake remediation work on the library windows can begin.

It is expected that it will take approximately four weeks for all of the scaffolding to be erected. The scaffolding will also have a precautionary mesh cover providing additional protection for those within the area.

Once the scaffolding is in place, post-earthquake remediation work on the window fixings and window glass in the James Hight Building will take place. The remediation work on the windows is expected to take 12 months to complete.

UC lodged a comprehensive insurance claim following the 4 September earthquake, which will cover the cost of the remediation work. Costs associated with any additional upgrade work carried out at the same time will be built into UC’s investment plan.

The Central Library’s lighting system is designed to automatically adjust to fluctuating levels of natural light within the library and will ensure that the library is adequately lit for study and research activities while the remediation work is carried out.

The aim of the remediation work is to ensure the James Hight Building is ‘better than ever’ as a result of the 4 September earthquake. In order to achieve this there may be some impact on the visual appeal of the building while the work is underway. UC is considering suggestions about improving the visual effect of the mesh.

“Our inspections of the James Hight Building following the 4 September earthquake revealed that while the library remained structurally sound some steel window fixings had sheared,” said Pro-Vice-Chancellor Learning Resources, Professor Sue McKnight.

“The safety of our students and staff is of paramount concern and for that reason UC has decided that it is important to check the fixings on every window. This means that each window pane must be removed and inspected. Once the building has been scaffolded and windows removed for inspection, the extra cost of upgrade makes replacement an attractive option.

“The new windows will have enhanced thermal and sound prevention qualities which we believe will improve the working and learning environment in the library. This work contributes towards creating a world-class learning environment here at UC and supports the university’s sustainability agenda.”

UC will re-open the Central Library on 21 February. The James Hight building is structurally sound and can be safely used by students and staff while the remediation work on the building’s windows takes place.
