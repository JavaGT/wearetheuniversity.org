The University of Canterbury has welcomed the appointment of diplomat Rosemary Banks as New Zealand’s Ambassador to the United States.

A UC alumna, Dr Banks is a member of the UC Council and a Senior Adjunct Fellow in UC’s Department of Political Science and International Relations, as well as a Crown Negotiator in the Treaty of Waitangi settlement process.

UC Chancellor Dr John Wood, who is a former New Zealand ambassador to the US, welcomed today’s announcement by the Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters.

“As a former ambassador myself, I fully understand the challenges and opportunities the role holds, and I believe Rosemary will do a wonderful job in Washington DC,” Dr Wood says.

“With a proven track record of consensus building in international relations and multicultural environments, Rosemary is bringing extensive expertise, vast experience and impressive negotiation skills, honed from serving and protecting New Zealand’s interests on the global stage for 40 years.”

Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the College of Arts, Professor Jonathan Le Cocq describes her as an inspiration to UC students and staff, and says that he values her connection with the College’s Department of Political Science and International Relations.

“With UC offering a premiere programme in political science and international relations, we’re delighted that such an illustrious UC Arts alumna, Senior Adjunct Fellow and honorary doctorate holder will be representing our country in the US,” Professor Le Cocq says.
