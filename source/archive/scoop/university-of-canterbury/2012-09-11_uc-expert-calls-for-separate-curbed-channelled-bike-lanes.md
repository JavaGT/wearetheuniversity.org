UC expert calls for separate curbed-channelled bike lanes

September 11, 2012

A University of Canterbury (UC) cycling expert has called on the government to provide dedicated cycling curb and channeling separation to protect cyclists from traffic.

UC Professor Simon Kingham said international experience showed more people would bike to and from work to significantly help reduce the country’s petrol consumption. He made the comments today as part of UC’s Eco week.

\`\`Many cycle planners from around the world including Portland, US which is one of the urban cycle success stories, often say build a separate cycle way and cyclists will support it.

\`\`Cycling is so good and has so many benefits. It relieves congestion, reduces obesity, helps climate change, and we should do all that we can to encourage more people to cycle.’’

He said research suggested that if cycling numbers increased it would increase demand for cycle-friendly road infrastructure.

In 2010, 10 cyclists died, 149 were seriously injured and 695 suffered minor injuries in police-reported crashes on New Zealand roads. Earlier this year a coroner asked if cyclists should legally have to use cycle lanes where they are provided.

As part of Eco Week, a fashion on bikes – Cycle Runway – will be held on campus today. Cycle Runway will feature sustainable designer labels mixed in with the popular op shop collections.

Other Eco Week events include Professor Kingham’s public lecture: What If Cycling Was Safer Than Driving? Will take place on campus tomorrow.

A bikeathon to raise funds for Sierra Leone will be held tomorrow. Volunteer students and celebrities will ask for sponsorship and then bike for an hour. Sam Johnson and Dr Mark Quigley will battle it out for the greatest distance.
