National ICT Innovation Institute opens at University of Canterbury

The NZi3 National ICT Innovation Institute has opened at the University of Canterbury.

The new purpose-built facility has also been recognised as the most environmentally-friendly educational building in the country.

Prime Minister the Hon John Key was the official guest at yesterday's opening. He was joined by three other Cabinet members, senior representatives of the Institute's founding partners Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Jade Software Corporation and Tait Electronics, and other stakeholders.

Mr Key said Christchurch's reputation as a hub of innovation in New Zealand would be cemented by the establishment of NZi3.

He said economies benefitted from partnerships between universities and industry. The New Zealand Government awarded the University of Canterbury $9.7 million for the development of NZi3 through its Partnerships for Excellence programme, on the proviso that it secured matching funding from the private sector.

NZi3 Director Dr Darin Graham said the Institute, with its location on the edge of the University of Canterbury campus and its external focus, would allow greater interaction between researchers and industry.

Tait Electronics Managing Director, Michael Chick, spoke on behalf of the Institute's founding partners. He paid tribute to his company's founder the late Sir Angus Tait who, he said, was a "powerful mover in the establishment of the Institute".

"In no small part we are here today as a result of Angus's tenacity, vision, commitment and determination. And of course, like the other founding partners from industry, because Tait was prepared to put its money where its mouth was."

The opening coincided with the announcement that the New Zealand Green Building Council had given the new purpose-built facility a five-star green rating. The NZi3 building is the first educational building in New Zealand to be awarded a 5-star rating.
