Treasury chief economist to visit University of Canterbury

August 23, 2012

Treasury’s Chief Economist Dr Girol Karacaoglu will talk to staff and students at the University of Canterbury’s Kirkwood Village next Monday.

Dr Karacaoglu will meet with Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr and other senior university staff as well as the UC’s Department of Economics and Finance.

Dr Carr said the Treasury Chief Economist wanted to visit the University in the wake of the earthquakes and meet key people to get an understanding of the University’s progress.

\`\`Girol wants to encourage all research staff across the University of Canterbury (UC) who are working on areas of research that are relevant to economic and social policy.

\`\`This will be great for our postgraduate students to listen to someone who shapes and drives the research agenda at Treasury,’’ Dr Carr said today.
