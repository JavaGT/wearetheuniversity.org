**Award-winning UC graduate opens art exhibition at Ilam Campus Gallery**

**July 10, 2013**

University of Canterbury (UC) award-winning fine arts graduate Laura Marsh has opened an exhibition at the Ilam Campus Gallery.

Marsh has a fine arts degree from UC and is the current recipient of the Olivia Spencer Bower Foundation Award.

Her exhibition, which runs until August 2, is titled _Home is Where the Gorse is._

\`\`My intention for my year as the Spencer Bower recipient was to further my Masters project.

\`\`This exhibition is in response to my experience of reconnecting to my home, the South Island, after living in the Auckland region for six years.

\`\`I was looking to remedy a sense of dislocation I had defined during my Masters. I came to understand that this was part of being a descendant of colonial settlers to this land.

\`\`Through returning home I have gained a greater love for my homeland and a deeper understanding and acceptance of what it means to be a South Islander.

\`\`This exhibition is a collection of artefacts representing this journey,’’ Marsh says.

The Olivia Spencer Bower Foundation Award was set up in 1987 and is building a reputation as an outstanding art award.

Among the previous winners includes UC graduate and outstanding New Zealand artist Seraphine Pick, who won in 1994.
