Geothermal research seminar at UC next month

October 17, 2012

Mighty River Power and the University of Canterbury (UC) will hold a geothermal research seminar at UC’s NZi3 centre on November 1.

The event will showcase a number of joint venture projects, several PhD research presentations and a Mighty River Power (MRP) update.

UC’s research and innovation director Nigel Johnson said UC was playing a key part in research to help improve the country’s geothermal capability.

\`\`Along with MRP, we have a team investigating the Taupo volcanic zone using a source to surface approach to identify underground reservoirs heated by magma.

\`\`This partnership has the goal of producing over 1000 megawatts of power for New Zealand from geothermal resources by 2020,’’ Dr Johnson said.

UC mechanical engineering staff form a significant part of a project research team looking at geothermal power generation technology development in New Zealand. The project is being led by the Heavy Engineering Research Association and funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.
