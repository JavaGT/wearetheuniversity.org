Formal merger discussions between UC and CCE

The University of Canterbury Council has agreed to hold formal discussions with the Christchurch College of Education (CCE) about a possible merger between the two institutions.

The aim of the joint talks is to develop a business case for any merger and a proposed structure for a merged institution. The detailed proposal, including a consideration of the academic issues, will be considered at the 30 March meeting of the University Council, and the response forwarded to the CCE Council in time for their 14 April meeting.

Yesterday’s decision to enter detailed discussions follows a CCE Council resolution at its meeting on 9 February to seek a merger with a university partner. The resolution nominated Canterbury as the preferred merger partner and proposed a merger date of 1 January 2006.

CCE Principal Dr Graham Stoop said at the time the merger proposal reflected New Zealand and overseas trends for teacher education to be undertaken within a university setting, in line with other professions such as medicine, law and engineering. It also recognised the difficulties associated with a College of Education sector with only two members, in Christchurch and Dunedin.

Speaking after yesterday’s UC Council meeting Chancellor Dr Robin Mann said Council had considered reports on the preliminary investigative work done and had taken a very positive view of the proposal to merge the two institutions.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp said there was already close alignment between the University and CCE with UC staff teaching into CCE programmes and credit arrangements between the two. There had also been an integration of services with printing and facilities management joining forces recently.

If both institutions elect to pursue a merger there are existing consultation processes for a consensual merger through the Tertiary Advisory Monitoring Unit and the Tertiary Education Commission, leading to a final decision by the
