Canterbury has a new chaplain - radio show host Spanky Moore

June 25, 2014

The University of Canterbury has a new senior chaplain, radio show host the Reverend Joshua ‘Spanky’ Moore, who replaces Tom Innes.

Rev Moore, who will start his new role in the second semester, starting July 14, got his nickname Spanky from the time he spent with Christchurch punk band Clowndog, which became infamous throughout New Zealand for throwing raw meat at their audiences during their performances.

\`\`Initially all of our band members took on these strange nicknames in the genuine belief it would help us get a record deal. Obviously that plan didn’t work out, so I’ve ended up where most failed punk band singers find themselves, working for the church,’’ Rev Moore says.

He is best known in more recent times for his time behind the microphone rather than the pulpit as host of longstanding breakfast show Breakfast with Spanky on the student radio station RDU 98.5FM. Over the years he has developed a cult following of alternative radio listeners and every morning has helped them through their cornflakes and traffic jams. His quick wit and brave interview style earned him the on-air tagline of The Saviour of Breakfast Radio.

Rev Moore was ordained as a minister in the Anglican Church in 2010 while hosting the breakfast show, before handing over the reins in 2013 to take up working full time as a Young Adults ministry developer. He still frequents the airwaves as a regular guest presenter on RDU as host of The Wire current affairs show.

Off air, Rev Moore has spent the last five years working closely with young adults and students and has become one of New Zealand’s pre-eminent Christian voices when it comes to re-thinking how faith connects with the Generation Y and the Millennial generation.

\`\`My time as a breakfast host on student radio means I bring some unique perspectives as a chaplain. My student radio listeners were by and large people who viewed the church with suspicion and yet were intrigued by the idea of faith and spirituality.’’

Previous chaplain Tom Innes had a central role in supporting staff and students after the earthquakes and during other major changes, working closely with student support services. Innes was involved in University of Canterbury sustainability initiatives, including the community garden. He was the public face of many of the key events at UC including the quake memorial ceremonies and the key moments in rebuilding programme.
