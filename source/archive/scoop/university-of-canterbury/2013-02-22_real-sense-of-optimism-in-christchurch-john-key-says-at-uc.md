Real sense of optimism in Christchurch, John Key says at UC

February 22, 2013

There was a real sense of optimism in Christchurch now, Prime Minister Hon John Key said at the University of Canterbury campus today during the second anniversary of the 2011 earthquake.

There was also greater expectation of what Christchurch will become, he told leading UC academics, senior management staff and students.

\`\`I am absolutely convinced this will be the most liveable city in New Zealand once the rebuild has been completed. For obvious reasons we never get the chance to plan a city the way that we are now planning the new and modern Christchurch. This will be an incredible

place to live.

\`\`UC is an integral part of Christchurch. It is a magnificent university and one of the gems in the crown. It’s a great university.

\`\`I remember my time at UC extremely fondly and times like orientation week. In my time here during O-week we would have a champagne breakfast of beer and sausages then studied our butts off for six weeks before exams.’’

The Prime Minister said New Zealand needed students pouring out of institutions like UC into companies and organisations to help make New Zealand stronger.

Earlier, he chatted freely with students during UC’s Orientation Week clubs day, signed shirts and put his autograph on a playhouse to be auctioned on TradeMe for charity by UC’s Student Volunteer Army.
