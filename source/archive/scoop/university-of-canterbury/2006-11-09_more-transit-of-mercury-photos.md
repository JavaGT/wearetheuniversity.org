Attached are further photos of the transit, taken around 9:55 a.am. NZDT.

One shows an enlarged view with the sunspot on the edge of the sun, lower left,  
and Mercury in the top right corner.

The second picture is the full disc of the sun with the sunspot in the lower  
right and Mercury the tiny spot right of centre.

Two different telescopes were used, so the orientation of the pictures change.
