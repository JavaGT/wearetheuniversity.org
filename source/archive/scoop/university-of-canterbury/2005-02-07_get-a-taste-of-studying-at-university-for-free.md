Get a taste of studying at university for free

3 February 2005

The University of Canterbury is offering 50 people the chance to study a University paper for free.

Student Services Equity and Access Manager Carolyn Ford, who has supervised the One Free Paper initiative, says in the past a large number of students came to university who had unreal expectations of their ability to take on full-time study alongside family life or work commitments

“The fee subsidised paper, now gives them a realistic view of student life and time frames involved,” Mrs Ford says.

Last year the University undertook a pilot programme offering one fee subsidised first year paper to adult students over 20 years of age who had never previously undertaken university study.

The purpose of the pilot was to allow students the opportunity to make sure university study was for them, before committing to a large financial outlay. It also provided the chance to find out what being a university student involved in the way of time and commitment.

This year the University will repeat the successful programme, which also offers mentoring, computing and study skills support.

Georgina Neither, a participant in the pilot in 2004, says it made a huge impact on her life.

“This was an awesome opportunity and it has allowed me to make clear decisions about my future,” says Georgina, who has pre-enrolled for four papers in 2005.
