No appeal on Conservatorium ruling
==================================

**No appeal on Conservatorium ruling**

The University of Canterbury will not be appealing the decision by independent commissioners to decline resource consent for a National Conservatorium of Music at the Arts Centre of Christchurch.

The University was informed earlier this month that consent had been declined on the grounds that, in the opinion of the commissioners, the proposed building was too large for the site.

Plans for the National Conservatorium at the Arts Centre were announced in June 2009. An application for resource consent was heard at a hearing in Christchurch in February.

Today, at its monthly meeting, the University of Canterbury Council determined that an appeal would not be made.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the Conservatorium proposal had been a significant project.

"The University would like to acknowledge the enthusiasm and dedication of our Music staff, our Facilities Management staff, the University Council, the Senior Management Team, and our legal, resource consent and other advisors.

"We also acknowledge the unwavering commitment of the Christchurch City Council and the Arts Centre Trust Board, and the many individuals and organisations that have provided their support publicly and privately."

Ends.
