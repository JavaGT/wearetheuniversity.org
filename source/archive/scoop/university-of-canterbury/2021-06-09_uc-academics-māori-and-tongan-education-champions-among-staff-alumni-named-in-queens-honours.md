Her key contributions include elucidating the myriad roles that the plant hormone group, the cytokinins, play in plant development. She has undertaken major collaborations with the applied sector in areas of forage, seed production and fruit development, as well as researching the regulation of flowering of New Zealand’s indigenous flora.
