Autumn graduation for almost 2000 Canterbury University students

Almost 2000 students will graduate from the University of Canterbury this week.

Four capping ceremonies will be held at the Christchurch Town Hall on Tuesday 24 April and Friday 27 April, with 1626 students receiving their degrees, diplomas and certificates in person and a further 348 graduating in absentia.

A highlight of the week will be the awarding of an honorary Doctor of Commerce degree to Canterbury University alumnus Kerry McDonald, and the presentation of the University of Canterbury Research Medal to internationally renowned volcanologist Professor Jim Cole (Geological Sciences).

Mr McDonald, who graduated from Canterbury University with a BCom in 1964 and a MCom (Hons) in 1967, has been active in business in New Zealand and Australia for many years.  
Initially working as an economist in New Zealand, the UK and Australia, Mr McDonald has been director of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Inc, a senior executive of Comalco in Australia, and has been a member of the board of Carter Holt Harvey.  
Since 2003, Mr McDonald has been a full time professional director. He is currently Chairman of Bank of New Zealand, Vice Chairman of Oceana Gold Limited and Chairman of its New Zealand business, and a director of National Australia Bank, Gough Gough and Hamer and Ports of Auckland. Mr McDonald is also a director of a number of other companies and organisations.  
Professor Cole is an internationally renowned volcanologist and petrologist whose reputation is built on 40 years of research.  
Professor Cole said he was honoured and delighted to be awarded the medal as it not only recognised his achievements, but those of his research partners.  
Graduation addresses will be delivered by Emeritus Professor John Burrows, Christchurch Mayor Garry Moore, Humanware Chief Executive Dr Richard Mander and Dr Jenny Harper, Director of the Christchurch Art Gallery, Te Puna O Waiwhetu.
