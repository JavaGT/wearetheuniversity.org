Why the EU, US Foreign Relations Paths Diverge:  
Ex-Irish Prime Minister Delivers  
Key NCRE Conference Address

Dr Garret FritzGerald, Irish Prime Minister during the 1980s, will give the keynote address for an upcoming conference hosted by the National Centre for Research on Europe (NCRE) at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch.

The European Union Studies Association (EUSA) Asia-Pacific Conference, "Outside Looking In: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on the EU", will be held from 9-11 September 2004 at the Christchurch Arts Centre. It is the second meeting of the Asia-Pacific EU Studies Association.

In his September 10th keynote address, FitzGerald will discuss the origins of the differences between the US and Europe’s in international relations that became so starkly delineated at the onset of the Iraq Crisis.

Division at both the state and popular level is due to a largely unnoticed divergence in international relations that emerged during the second half of the last century, he says.

"During this period, Europe was reacting constructively in no fewer than seven different ways against centuries of attempts by one or other of its states to dominate the Continent -- whereas the US was responding to a quite different contemporary challenge: that of finding itself a super-power," FitzGerald argues.

On September 9th, FitzGerald, who now chairs the Future of Europe Committee at the Institute of European Affairs in Dublin, will deliver a College of Business and Economics public lecture on the Ireland as "Celtic Tiger".

The Asia-Pacific EU Studies Association brings together organisations throughout the region -- from India in the west to China and Japan in the east and Australia and New Zealand in the south. The conference is sponsored by EUSA-New Zealand, the NCRE and the European Commission.

The "Outside Looking In" theme is intended to stimulate debate and research within the Asia-Pacific region on EU topics. The process of European integration may take on different characteristics and dynamics when viewed externally. The objective is to identify these perspectives and develop a wider research agenda for EU scholars in the area.

The National Centre for Research on Europe at the University of Canterbury is the only dedicated European research centre in New Zealand. It is a multi-disciplinary Centre of Academic Excellence and Expertise that operates nationally, uniting students and scholars from a wide range of fields to research and study European issues.

The Centre has significant responsibility for the European Union's outreach efforts within New Zealand and the Pacific. Raising a critical awareness of the EU, informing government, the media and public opinion are all equally important aspects of the NCRE's core function.
