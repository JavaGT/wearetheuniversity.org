**UC Graduate Destination Survey reveals high levels of fulltime employment for university graduates**

  
The University of Canterbury’s recent survey of its 2010 graduates has revealed that more than 95 per cent of respondents are either working full-time or part-time and/or undertaking further study. More than two-thirds of respondents (68 per cent) reported that their current job either meets or exceeds their expectations as a position for a university graduate.  
The survey was conducted ten months after the UC 2010 student cohort graduated from UC and attracted a high response rate of 38 per cent (1404 respondents).

The survey provided clear evidence that UC graduates are engaged in a wide range of occupations and demonstrated that undertaking higher levels of study provides university graduates with greater earning power. University graduates with a PhD reported that they were paid more than those with undergraduate degrees, with 83 per cent of recent PhDs earning $60,001 or more. This compares favourably with the $40,001 to $50,000 modal income for fulltime employed university graduates with a new undergraduate degree.

Of the respondents who described their attitude to their current employment, 80 per cent reported that they were either already working in their ideal employment ten months out from graduating or that their current employment was a step in the right direction.

A greater proportion of respondents from health and education were employed than those from other fields. Of the approximately 36 per cent of Education graduates who responded to the survey, 86 per cent (288 people) stated that they are currently employed – with the majority of these indicating they are working more than 30 hours a week. A further 33 university graduates (10 per cent) have continued with fulltime study, with a smaller proportion (8 per cent) studying part-time. 85 per cent of graduate respondents from the fields of Technology and Engineering reported that they were employed fulltime.

The University of Canterbury proved to be a popular choice for further study with two-thirds of alumni respondents who reported that they were undertaking further study indicating that they were choosing to do so at UC.

“The results of the survey prove that University of Canterbury graduates are getting the jobs that they need and want and demonstrate the value of university study to our economy,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr.

“A recently-released annual report on the student loan scheme from the Ministry of Education confirmed that university graduates earn more than those who complete level 1 to 3 certificates and diplomas. Their report stated that four years after university study, the median earnings of young bachelors degree graduates were 45 per cent higher than those who completed level 1 to 3 certificates, and 28 per cent higher than those students completing diplomas. The report also states that even in their first after study the media earnings of bachelors graduates are above the national median earnings.

“The fact that University of Canterbury graduates are getting jobs that are in line with their career aspirations and that earn them higher salaries is good for the UC graduates themselves and good for their communities – and that’s great for New Zealand.”
