UC launches new virtual research centre

A new virtual research centre has been established at the University of Canterbury with state-of-the-art equipment supplied by Bio-Rad Laboratories, some of which has never been used before in the Southern Hemisphere.

The centre's work will focus on drug discovery, biotechnology and the development of new bio-nanomaterials. Work already planned includes the modification of proteins to make them last longer in the body as therapeutic drugs; development of new means of extracting and purifying valuable proteins from milk ; and reducing fouling of stainless steel surfaces - a major issue in the food and pharmaceuticals industries.

The Biomolecular Interaction Centre (BIC) is a collaborative project spearheaded by Professor Juliet Gerrard (Biological Sciences), Dr Emily Parker, Adjunct Professor Bill Swallow (Chemistry) and Professor Conan Fee (Chemical and Process Engineering). They are in partnership with researchers at Lincoln and Otago universities, Crop and Food and Environmental Science and Research (ESR).

Dr Parker says interactions between biological molecules are crucial to the processes that make life possible.

"The centre has invested in a collection of new instruments that enable us to study the detail of biomolecule interactions using the latest techniques available.

"The BioRad ProteOn XPR36 is a sophisticated instrument that allows us to observe directly the strength of biomolecule interactions via a technique known as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR).

"This instrument is the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere and will allow us to follow the interactions of molecules with surfaces in real time so we can see when molecules are being bound or released from surfaces under various conditions."

The primary investment in the new centre has been $1.85 million on new equipment. UC has funded 49 percent of this investment and the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) has funded 43 percent from its Innovation and Development Fund. The remainder has been covered by Crop & Food (5 percent) and Lincoln University (3 percent).

Professor Fee says interactions of biological molecules with surfaces play an important part not only in biological processes but also in industrial processes.

"Such interactions may be involved in reactions to create new products or in purification processes such as ion exchange chromatography."

Bio-Rad Laboratories is a multinational manufacturer and distributor of life science research and clinical diagnostics products and the manufacturer of the ProteOn Surface Plasmon Resonance system.

Bio-Rad's CEO Norman Schwartz says: "Bio-Rad Laboratories would like to recognise the newly formed Biomolecular Interaction Centre located at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. It is our hope that the achievements of this new facility will lead to the development of new drugs to treat a variety of diseases and, ultimately, provide better health for all."

While the centre is based at UC, it has been established to provide regional infrastructure to support the study of biomolecular interactions. It builds on the Growth Industry Pilot Initiative (GIPI) contract Canterbury and Lincoln universities were awarded in 2006, which has helped build up an enterprise culture within the biotechnology community.
