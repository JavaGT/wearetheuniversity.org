UC and CPIT launch new degree programme

The University of Canterbury (UC) will launch its new Master of Health Sciences and Bachelor of Nursing joint initiative with Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) today (13 October).

The new programme gives the opportunity for students who already hold a degree to gain two further qualifications in just two and a half years.

Head of the School of Health Sciences, Professor Philip Schluter, says that the collaboration with CPIT on the programme is a new and exciting step for the School.

“The partnership with CPIT will provide an entry pathway into nursing and will, for the first time in New Zealand, graduate nurses who have undertaken masters level study,” he says.

Students will be fulltime UC Master of Health Sciences (MHealSc) and part-time Bachelor of Nursing (BN) students for the first two years, after which they will be fulltime CPIT students for the remaining part of the programme. A part-time MHealSc option is also being developed.

“The masters qualification will equip students with the advanced academic skills and knowledge should they wish to progress towards a doctoral degree. It will also help build the research base within the nursing profession,” he says.

Having completed the MHealSc/BN programmes, graduates will be eligible to gain employment as nurses in New Zealand. The MHealSc will give graduates a thorough academic knowledge which may be beneficial to employment and career progression.
