Master’s internship gives competitive advantage

University of Canterbury (UC) student Meenal Pathak is already making a difference to cancer treatment times through her Master of Business Management (MBM) experience.

As part of UC’s intensive MBM programme, Pathak undertook an 18-week internship with the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB).

She says the opportunity to work on the Faster Cancer Treatment project – a review of how patients with a high suspicion of gynaecological cancer are triaged – has been the highlight of her study.

“Getting practical experience is so valuable. I’m learning so many things about building relationships in New Zealand’s work environment that you couldn’t learn in a classroom,” Pathak says.

With a wealth of experience in dentistry and hospital management, Pathak already had a successful career in India.

However, she wanted to expand her understanding of management to other aspects of the healthcare industry on a global level.

She says the MBM at UC appealed because it centres on applied learning.

“I wanted a qualification that would give me a global view and international experience so that I could gain a competitive advantage,” she says.

Strong partnerships between UC’s internationally accredited Executive Development Programmes and key employers such as the CDHB offer students individualised opportunities to gain hands-on experience, while making a difference within local businesses and the community.

CDHB learning and development advisor Jacqui Benter-Lynch says that internships benefit the CDHB, the University and students.

“The Canterbury DHB-UC partnership provides enormous value. The opportunity to apply current thinking and theories in the workplace environment is crucial to maintaining a high-performing health system and interns play an important role in this,” she says.

Pathak says that her UC Master’s has been a fantastic introduction to studying and working in New Zealand.

“The internship, collaborative method of learning and the focus on group work and presentation skills will be beneficial to me as I further my career,” she says.

Pathak says that she feels well-prepared to take her next step. She is pursuing a management role in the New Zealand healthcare industry and would like to study towards a PhD further down the track.
