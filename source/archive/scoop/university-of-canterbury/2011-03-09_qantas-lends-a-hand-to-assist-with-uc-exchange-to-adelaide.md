### Qantas lends a hand to assist with UC exchange to University of Adelaide post-earthquake

More than 160 students have now arrived at the University of Adelaide for a semester one exchange from the University of Canterbury organised in the wake of the 22 February earthquake. 157 students travelled on a charter flight provided by Qantas on Sunday with the remainder travelling on commercial flights early this week.

The University of Adelaide Vice-Chancellor Professor James McWha, formerly on the staff at UC for 15 years, was in touch with the University immediately after the earthquake. “Professor McWha and his team have really pulled out the stops to ensure that our students will be well looked after in Adelaide,” said Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Town

“We are also very grateful for the assistance that the Qantas has provided,” he said. “Qantas provided a very reasonable price for the Boeing 747 charter flight and has also accommodated additional students on commercial flights this week. Such assistance is very much appreciated.”

Students’ flights to and from the University of Adelaide for the semester one exchange have been paid for by the University. Students have been offered accommodation in the University of Adelaide Homestay Programme or purpose built student apartments. The UC students will return to Christchurch in late June ready to resume their studies at UC in semester two in July.

“For this group of students we believe it will be a great experience and will help consolidate the strong links between our two Universities” said UC Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr.

New Zealand-based student exchange programmes have also been established with the University of Auckland, AUT University, Massey University, Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Waikato. Around 300 students have applied for this option.
