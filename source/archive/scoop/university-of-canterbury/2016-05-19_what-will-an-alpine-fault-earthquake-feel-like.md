**What will an Alpine Fault earthquake feel like? - UC Connect public lecture**

In an upcoming UC Connect public lecture, University of Canterbury Earthquake Engineering Professor Brendon Bradley will discuss how new methods of understanding ground shaking in the Canterbury earthquakes are helping us prepare for the future living in the Shaky Isles.

His lecture will give insights into the ground shaking ‘beneath your feet’ that occurred during the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes through basic concepts as well as advanced numerical simulations that have been validated from observational data.

In particular, Prof Bradley will look into the importance of high-performance computing and visualisation in performing and interpreting such simulations.

“Looking forward, these advanced computational methods have allowed for a first detailed examination into what Canterbury can expect from future major earthquakes, such as a future Alpine Fault earthquake," he says.

One of the youngest New Zealand academics to be promoted to professor, Prof Bradley is a multi-award-winning earthquake engineer whose research focus is on the prediction of earthquake-induced ground motions and seismically-induced losses to infrastructure. A UC alumnus, Prof Bradley is also Deputy-Director of QuakeCoRE: The Centre for Earthquake Resilience based at UC, and a Rutherford Discovery Fellow.

UC Connect public lecture, _What will an Alpine Fault earthquake feel like?_ 7pm, Tuesday 24 May, C Block, Ilam campus, University of Canterbury.
