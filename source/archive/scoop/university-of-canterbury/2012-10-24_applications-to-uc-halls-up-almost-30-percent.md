Applications to UC halls up almost 30 percent

October 24, 2012

The University of Canterbury (UC) is seeing a significant increase in applications to halls of residence accommodation for 2013.

UC admissions and enrolment manager Trudi Zawodny said the current applications equate to a 29 percent increase in numbers compared to this time last year.

Of the biggest halls, University Hall applications as at October 4 were 429, compared with 359 last year, Rochester and Rutherford 496, up from 334 last year; and College House 178 from 136.

\`\`It’s fantastic to see so many students considering UC as their choice of study for 2013. More students and their families have visited UC this year than in 2010 and 2011 and they’ve had the chance to see the exciting developments taking place,’’ Zawodny said today.

\`\`Parents are a key decider in where their children will go to university and knowing that UC and its halls of residences are safe and will support them through their studies is paramount.’’

The halls provide 1550 beds and although applications haven not returned to pre-quake numbers it was pleasing to see numbers begin to climb again. Zawodny said this reflected the community regaining confidence in Christchurch and UC as a destination for university study.

\`\`It has been really exciting to see accommodation application numbers significantly increase from last year. We know students apply to multiple institutions and we know that not all are going to choose UC for a variety of reasons.

\`\`However, we do encourage students and parents to come and see what UC has to offer. Where students choose to live can have a big impact on the success of their studies,’’ she said.
