Grant Enables New Programme For Children Living With Anxiety
============================================================

An exciting new programme to help children living with anxiety is able to go ahead following a generous donation from the Sir Campbell and Lady Leita Wylie Foundation.

The latest programme from Triple P parenting courses, Fear-Less, is being run by the Pukemanu Centre, the Child and Family Psychology Services based at the University of Canterbury.

Clinic Director Suzi Hall says following the challenges experienced through the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a significant need for more services to help with anxiety and emotional well-being.

“We’ve had to regularly close our waitlists because of high demand, and we urgently needed to expand our support to families. The Fear-Less Triple P programme is evidence based, resulting in good outcomes for managing anxiety. Its group format will allow us to see more families so that we can expand our support services.

“The additional funding means we’ve been able to provide more staff and resources to meet the needs of these families.

“We’re hoping to help up to 250 children over three years who we might not otherwise have been able to see. These are children aged 6-14 years who have moderate to high levels of anxiety that causes distress or impacts on their everyday functioning. It also targets siblings and parents.”

Ms Hall says research shows that fewer than one in five children with anxiety receive any kind of intervention and intervention is more effective if parents and siblings are involved.

Established nine years ago, the Pukemanu Centre provides free assessments and interventions on a short-term basis for more than 150 children and whānau each year who are unable to access other services for financial, eligibility or waiting time reasons.

The Centre is managed by registered psychologists and operates as part of the professional training course for Masters level students and above, who are currently undertaking advanced post-graduate training in Child and Family Psychology at the University of Canterbury. Students are involved with all Centre activities, working alongside senior registered psychologists.

The Sir Campbell and Lady Leita Wylie Foundation is a long-time donor to the Child and Family Psychology Programme.
