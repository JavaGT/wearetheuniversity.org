**Airlines discriminate against pregnant women, UC researcher says**

**June 18, 2013**

Airlines are discriminating against pregnant women, a University of Canterbury (UC) gender researcher says.

Associate Professor Annick Masselot says a common complaint relates to airline practices which impose a \`fit to fly’ condition on pregnant women.

She says many airlines impose a total ban on pregnant women flying past a deadline which can vary from 28 to 37 weeks of pregnancy.

\`\`Airlines justify their self-declared regulation on grounds of health and safety but, in reality, there is no clear medical or scientific research backing the need to ban pregnant women from flights.

\`\`It is arguably a form of control over women in order to limit the potential inconvenience of dealing with a woman going into labour in a plane.

\`\`There should not be any reason to request a medical certificate or refuse women to board a plane based on pregnancy. There is no reason to impose such conditions on pregnant women when passengers who might suffer from, for example, high blood pressure or heart problems are not requested to provide any evidence of their ability to fly. Pregnancy is not a form of illness. 

\`\`The practice is reported to exist and is accepted across the world. In fact it is legally questionable, at least in Europe, under the Goods and Services Directive. However, there has not been any legal challenge.

\`\`People do not question refusal to fly conditions because of the existence of widespread and deeply ingrained gender stereotypes. These stereotypes are harmful because women who are pregnant have their right to move limited by airlines for no scientific reason. There also are issues of privacy. Women are requested to disclose personal details about their pregnancy to complete strangers.’’

Professor Masselot’s report on fighting pregnancy and maternity-related discrimination has just been published by the European Commission. It is available online: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/your\_rights/discrimination\_\_pregnancy\_maternity\_parenthood\_final.en.pdf  
She says far too many people infringe legal obligations relating to the rights of pregnant women and they are not held accountable for their breach of law.

\`\`This disregard of the law in relation to pregnant women can be put down to harmful gender and cultural stereotypes which are very much alive. Women are often still regarded as the main carers and mothers rather than individuals or workers with full employment rights. 

\`\`Although my report focuses on pregnancy and parenthood in the employment market, it also unveils discriminatory practices in other areas, such as the provisions of goods and services and insurance,’’ Professor Masselot says.
