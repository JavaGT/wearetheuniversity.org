UC Vice Chancellor Re-appointed

The Chancellor of the University of Canterbury Dr John Wood announced today the re-appointment of the Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr, for a further five year term from February 2014. Concurrence to the appointment has been received from the State Services Commission.

Dr Wood confirmed that Dr Carr enjoyed the full support of the UC Council to continue his leadership of UC to recovery and growth.

“Dr Carr has confronted extraordinary challenges during his first term as Vice-Chancellor. Having established a new strategic direction and undertaken a substantial review of staffing, Dr Carr ably led the University through the emergency response phase of the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes, ensuring a full programme of teaching was delivered in both years.”

“Dr Carr is now pursuing a coherent recovery plan involving the rebuild and remediation of physical structures, the recruitment and retention of students and the development of the “UC Futures” case for support to Government, as well as ongoing strong financial management and efficiency and effectiveness improvements.”

“The UC Council is confident that the University of Canterbury is well positioned to build on its existing strengths and reinvigorate itself as a leading teaching and research university that is more connected to students, staff, alumni, employers and other stakeholders. Dr Carr’s commitment for the next five years is a signal that we are on track.”

“I would like to thank the UC Council and all UC staff for their support for Dr Carr and their ongoing dedication to their roles and to the university, despite the challenging times we have and will continue to face. The UC Council is proud of this university and will continue to advocate and support its aspiration to promote a world class learning environment.”
