Nicky Hager public lecture

**Nicky Hager public lecture: Dirty Politics and Dirty Policing?**

The University of Canterbury’s School of Law is hosting investigative journalist Nicky Hager in a public talk about his Court Case, next week.

Hager will focus the lecture – titled _Dirty Politics and Dirty Policing?_ – on his publication of the book _Dirty Politics_, and subsequent police actions to try to discover his confidential sources.

In _Dirty Politics_ he revealed a secret smear campaign of social-media attacks coordinated from the then-National Prime Minister’s office against its political opponents and concurrent campaigns – on behalf of the tobacco, alcohol and sugary foods industries – against public health professionals. Detailing the rise of attack politics in New Zealand, the book featured leaked emails between National Party figures and right-wing bloggers.

The lecture will cover the sequence of events following the publication of _Dirty Politics_, focusing on the actions of the Police, including searching his house and computer in his absence, followed by the court cases against the Police.

An important aspect of the case is the apology to Hager, the secrecy of the amount of the compensation paid, and the apparent lack of accountability of Police and others who contravened the law. The event’s format will be an overview of what happened, followed by a discussion and Q&A session on the issues raised – especially the apparent link between the Police investigation and the strong indicators of party-political influence on it.

UC alumnus and former UC Law academic, Professor Chris Gallavin (now Massey University) will also attend as a discussion panel member.

Nicky Hager is a well-known New Zealand author and investigative journalist. He has written seven books about New Zealand politics, intelligence, public relations and war, including the 2014 book _Dirty Politics_. Last year the book _Hit and Run_, co-authored by fellow journalist Jon Stephenson, told the story of children and other innocents being killed and injured in an SAS raid on two Afghan villages. He is the only New Zealand member of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
