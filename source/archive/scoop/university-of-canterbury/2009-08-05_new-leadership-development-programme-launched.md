**New Leadership Development Programme Launched**

The University of Canterbury has today launched its new Leadership Development Programme for corporate senior and middle managers and for SME owners, directors and managers.

“The programme aims to develop the leadership competencies that will transform organisations for long-term sustainability in the post-recession 21st Century”, said Mr Kyran Newell, Manager, Professional & Executive Development at the University of Canterbury.

“The new context that organisations are facing is different from the pre-recession world of short-term profit maximisation; the new world of holistic thinking and long-term organisational sustainability requires a new set of leadership skills”, he said.

The Leadership Development Programme is a block-taught, 15-day experience, facilitated by the University of Canterbury’s leadership specialists and practitioners from business, services organisations and government. It is supported by international leadership research and best organisational practices.

“The Leadership Model, Leadership Competencies Framework and Key Themes that underpin the programme assure a cohesive and unique programme that is right for our times”, said Mr Newell.

“Participants will engage in leading-edge learning and build a new personal support network while achieving personal growth and development that will transform their leadership and their organisations”.

The inaugural programme is scheduled for 14-18 September, 12-16 October and 16-20 November 2009. Applications are now open.
