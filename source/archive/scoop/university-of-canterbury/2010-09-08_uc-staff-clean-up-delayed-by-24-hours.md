UC Staff clean-up delayed by 24 hours
=====================================

**Wednesday, 8 September 2010, 11:16 am**  
**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

**UC Staff clean-up delayed by 24 hours**  
  
In light of this morning's aftershocks we have decided to delay our progressive recall of staff by 24 hours to allow confirmation of building status.

We still intend to run a phased and tightly controlled programme to allow staff to assist in the clean-up. Staff will be required to attend a briefing on the clean-up before they will be allowed into their buildings. They will also be issued with Health and Safety guidelines, giving instructions on what they can and cannot do. The revised schedule is as follows:

Thursday 9 September at 12noon: Engineering including Forestry, Old Maths (excluding Erskine); Von Haast, Zoology, Biology and Communication Disorders (Briefing C1).

Friday 10 September at 9am: Geography; Gateway Antarctica; Psychology and Sociology; College of Business and Economics; School of Law; English; History, Modern Languages; Erskine; Rutherford (Briefing C1).

Friday 10 September at 12noon: Fine Arts and Music (including houses); Social Work; Aotahi: Maori and Indigenous Studies; Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies; Registry (Briefing C1).

Friday 10 September at 1.30pm: College of Education, Dovedale campus (Briefing Jack Mann Auditorium).

Please be aware that this timetable may change again if there are further impacts from ongoing aftershocks or new information affecting health and safety becomes available. The willingness of our staff to help is much appreciated.

ENDS
