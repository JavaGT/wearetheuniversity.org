UC researching how cancer survivors feel better about life

October 4, 2012

University of Canterbury is looking into what helps cancer survivors in remission improve their sense of well-being and quality of life.

UC masters student Carmen Cook is researching and interviewing cancer survivors to find out how health professionals can best support the diverse needs of survivors.

As rates of cancer survival appear to be increasing it is her hope that the research will benefit survivors and health experts.

\`\`Many people are surviving their diagnosis and treatment to become cancer survivors – those in the post-treatment phase of their illness,’’ Cook said today.

\`\`Most of us would consider cancer treatment as hopefully allowing us to recover from such a worrying illness. Following treatment, if successful, we are then classed as a cancer survivor, and this should be life-long.

\`\`Yet there is often an expectation that now we will identify with being well again, and pick up life as we knew it before the experience with cancer. But for most, life is not the same as before. For many cancer survivors this topsy-turvy reality of coping with degrees of illness and wellness can affect our overall sense of well-being.’’

Latest figures show nearly 21,000 New Zealanders are diagnosed with cancer each year and more than 8000 people die with cancer as underlying cause in a year. People with cancer have a 63 percent chance of survival.

It has been recognised nationally and internationally that transitioning into the phase of cancer survivorship was often fraught with difficulty.

Fear of recurrence, coping with fatigue, pain, and depression are some of the issues often cited as common problems. Much research is being undertaken to assist cancer survivors; and not just those in the transition phase but also those now classed as long-term survivors.

The aim of Cook’s research was to consider what worked best for cancer survivors to improve their sense of well-being. Most cancer survivors will suffer setbacks at some stage but many have also found relief and comfort as part of their cancer journey.

Cook said she was looking for themes that cancer survivors might speak about as having enhanced their feelings of well-being.

\`\`Although this is a life-changing event, many people diagnosed with cancer manage to find ways that work for them to enable some sense of relief and understanding.’’

Cook is working out of the Health Sciences Centre at the UC. Over the last decade, the centre has seen an increasing number of students who have enrolled to undertake postgraduate studies in Health Sciences. The Health Sciences Centre also led the development of a new undergraduate qualification at UC; the Bachelor of Health Sciences, from next year.
