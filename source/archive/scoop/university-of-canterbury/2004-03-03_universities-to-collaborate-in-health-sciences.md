Canterbury and Otago Universities to collaborate in health sciences

The Universities of Canterbury and Otago have agreed to work together in research and teaching in health sciences and related disciplines.

The Memorandum of Agreement - to be signed at the University of Canterbury on Thursday - brings together the two largest tertiary institutions in the South Island, formalising the significant collaboration that already exists between staff and students at the universities, particularly in research and teaching.

The agreement provides for collaboration in academic services, research, and library and information services between Otago University’s Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the University of Canterbury.

Otago’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Graeme Fogelberg, welcomed the agreement. “Our Christchurch School has a long history of collaboration with Canterbury in health sciences and I believe that formalising the relationship will benefit both institutions and the whole of the South Island.”

Canterbury’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp said the agreement was timely. “We have just formed a Health Sciences Centre to provide a focus for more than 60 staff who work in health-related areas at Canterbury, teaching and researching in subjects as diverse as psychology and bioengineering.”

The MOA creates the opportunity for joint teaching appointments, joint supervision of Masters and Doctoral theses and projects, and for staff at both universities to teach into the programmes of the other.

The agreement also provides for Otago University’s Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the University of Canterbury to work together to foster health sciences research in Canterbury and beyond.

It envisages opportunities for both joint approaches for the purchase and use of research equipment and facilities, and joint approaches to funding agencies to support research projects of mutual interest.

The two universities have agreed to collaborate in planning and development of library and information resources for teaching and research, with access to those resources and services through the enrolling institution.

The MOA will be signed for an initial three year period, with provision for alterations at any time subject to the mutual consent of both parties.

A Liaison Group will be established comprising the Dean and Associate Dean of the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic) of the University of Canterbury, with one further representative from each institution.

The Liaison Group will meet at least three times a year for strategic planning of teaching and research programmes and to develop policy and process for resourcing and servicing those activities.

Note to editors: Reporters and photographers are welcome to attend. The Memorandum will be signed on the sixth floor of the Registry building at the University of Canterbury at noon on Thursday 4 March by the two Vice-Chancellors.
