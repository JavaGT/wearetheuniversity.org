**“Life Became Simple”**

_Ilam Apartments provide a haven for red-zone family after their apartment auction prize win._

The Hussain family have reaped the benefits of living in Ilam Apartments since their TradeMe win earlier this year.

In late July Hanin Hussain and her family moved into their new home at Ilam Apartments after winning UC Accommodation’s TradeMe auction for a five bedroom apartment. Their apartment prize, valued at $15,000, was for a four month period.

Hanin, who is a Senior Teacher at the University of Canterbury’s Early Childhood Learning Centre, said that living so close to her office has been great. “I love walking to and from work and enjoy seeing all the students. After the earthquake everything moved to the west side of town so living here has been very convenient for us.” Sadly the family’s home in Dallington was condemned after the February quake, so finding accommodation in a relatively unaffected area of town has been a welcome relief.

Moving at the height of winter, the family of three immediately noticed how warm and dry the apartment was in comparison to their draughty, red-zoned home and how simple life quickly became. “We didn’t have to deal with power or telephone companies and I no longer had to mow the lawns!” David Coulson said. The residents have formed their own community, refer to the family as their $1 neighbours. “There is a great atmosphere here, we even had a floor party and met outside the elevator for dinner one evening.”

The family are moving into another apartment at Ilam Apartments village when their prize concludes but hope to purchase a home nearby. “We’ll be sad to leave but living here has been a very positive experience,” Hanin said.

It’s really great that we could help a family who lost their home,” said UC Accommodation Leasing Manager, Helen Brown. “They’ve fitted into the community we’ve built here really well.”

The modern five bedroom apartment at the Ilam Village was auctioned through TradeMe for a four month stay with a reserve of only $1, and is only one of the compassionate post-earthquake initiatives taken by UC Accommodation. UC Accommodation also opened apartment blocks, which are normally only available to students, to the Christchurch community for use as office space and/or residential living. The demand for such space has led to UC Accommodation opening additional apartments and offices since the initial spaces were offered to the community.
