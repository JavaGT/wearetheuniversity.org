NZ brain drainers returning home more quickly, UC researcher says

April 1, 2013

New Zealand’s young brain-drainers have always returned home but a University of Canterbury (UC) researcher believes they may be returning more quickly as finding jobs and gaining long term residency becomes more difficult in the United Kingdom.

UC management researcher Dr Rosemary Baird says there is anecdotal and statistical evidence that brain drainers are returning.

\`\`It certainly seems as if those who are going to the UK stay for less time because of the difficulty of obtaining long term visas or residency. For Kiwis who want to migrate elsewhere more long term, other options apart from the UK, including Australia, may become more preferable.

Dr Baird says overseas Kiwis were always drawn home by the lure of family, child-friendly lifestyle and familiarity.

\`\`Long term, New Zealand’s relatively plentiful supply of land, water, recreational parks and resources will become increasingly important. Many Kiwis harbour a deep rooted desire to own property. Although real estate in the major cities is increasingly pricey, owning land is often still more achievable in New Zealand than in the big Australian and European cities, especially if financed by overseas savings.

\`\`Once children enter the equation this is often a major motivation to return to New Zealand. The fact is that even compared to Australia where health and safety regulations are far more stringent, children in New Zealand have many sporting, outdoors and recreational opportunities available at a reasonable price. Having extended family nearby for support and company is a massive draw card.’’

New Zealanders once flocked to the UK for the opportunity to gain experience and return home but recent Home Office figures show the number of New Zealand citizens entering the UK for employment has dropped.

The number of New Zealanders who departed for Australia last month was the lowest in two years. Statistics New Zealand said 3770 kiwis crossed the ditch in February, compared to 3920 the previous month and 4630 a year ago.
