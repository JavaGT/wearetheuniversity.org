**Platform festival to showcase the arts at UC**

The University of Canterbury’s College of Arts will showcase the wealth of artistic talent among its staff and students during the third biennial Platform arts festival next month.

Platform, which runs from 20-30 May, will showcase all that the University has to offer in the arts – from opera, music recitals and art exhibitions to theatre, lectures and film.

Featuring work and performances by students and staff, the 11-day festival will be staged at various locations in the central city and on the University’s Ilam campus.

Highlights include the performance by UC voice students of two short operas – Emmanuel Chabrier’s _A Faulty Education_ (_Une education manquee_) and Giovanni Pergolesi’s _Maid into Mistress_ (_La Serva Padrona_); a piano recital by UC School of Music lecturer Gao Ping and leading New Zealand pianist Michael Houstoun; a presentation by the Different Light Theatre Company, whose performers all have intellectual disabilities; a performance of Aristophanes’ 2500-year-old political comedy _Wasps_; and a showcase or arias performed by Dame Malvina Major and students in the University’s Voice Programme.

Festival Director Greg Latham said Platform will give the wider Christchurch community a chance to see the next generation of artists and performers work alongside the University’s world-class staff to create what will be a dynamic and unique event.

“The combined talent of the contributors is quite an extraordinary collection and audiences will be able to experience a diverse programme of superb quality. Many of the events are free to the public, with moderate prices across the board for some very exceptional shows.”

Other events to look out for during the festival include the Free Theatre’s production of Christopher Marlowe’s 16th century play _Doctor Faustus_; a piano recital by UC’s Professor of Piano Michael Endres; a performance of new music by established and emerging Canterbury composers by the Silencio Ensemble; a series of lectures by College of Arts staff; a concert by young musicians from the University’s Pettman Junior Academy of Music; and an evening of hearty food, music and verse from Thomas Hardy’s England at The Octagon Restaurant.
