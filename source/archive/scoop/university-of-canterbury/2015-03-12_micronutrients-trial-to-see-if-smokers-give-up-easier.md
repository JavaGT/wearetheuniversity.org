**Micronutrients smoking trial to see if smokers give up easier**

**March 12, 2015**

A substantial University of Canterbury smoking trial has begun to see if smokers are more likely to quit if they consume micronutrients.

Principal investigator and doctoral student Phillipa Newton wants to find out the impact that micronutrients (vitamins, minerals and amino acids) have on quit attempts made and long-term abstinence of smoking. Her study is being supervised by psychology professors Neville Blampied and Julia Rucklidge.

Christchurch residents who want to stop smoking with the help of her research can visit the university’s mental health and nutrition research group’s website for more information: http://bit.ly/smokingandnutrition.

About a third of adults in the world are smokers. A recent Australian study that followed over 200,000 Australians found that up to two in every three smokers will die from a smoking-related illness if they continue to smoke.

Newton says smoking is a deadly worldwide epidemic and more than 60 percent of former Christchurch smokers have taken up smoking again since the earthquakes which has resulted in a demand for ways to help people quit smoking.

Despite the negative consequences of ill-health, premature death and economic cost people continue to smoke because tobacco contains the highly addictive substance nicotine.

”If smoking rates are going to decrease, treatment options that are safe and effective deserve to be explored. Smoking interventions need to assist smokers to make a quit-attempt and remain smoke-free long term.

“Previous research on addiction has shown that relapse rates and alcohol and opiate withdrawal symptoms can be reduced and psychological functioning can be improved when taking micronutrients. In 2013 I conducted a pilot smoking cessation study and found that nutritional supplements were a viable way forward to help people quit smoking.”

Newton has launched a much larger study to further investigate if micronutrients help people to quit smoking and stay smoke-free long term when compared to a control group taking a placebo.

“As part of the study I will monitor craving and withdrawal with the intention to determine whether micronutrients will decrease these symptoms making it easier to remain abstinent,” Newton says.

Her study is using a broad spectrum micronutrient formula that contains an array of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. These nutrients are essential for optimal brain health.

\`\`Smoking is a major issue in New Zealand. It costs government over $1.5 billion a year because of early death, loss of production due to illness and smoking-related healthcare costs. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in New Zealand accounting for around 4300 to 4600 deaths a year. Second-hand smoke is the leading environmental cause of preventable death in New Zealand and kills around 350 people a year.”
