**Young UC researchers’ work recognised**

Two University of Canterbury (UC) academics have been named the inaugural recipients of the University of Canterbury’s Early and Emerging Career Researcher Award.

Dr Brendon Bradley (Civil and Natural Resources Engineering) and Dr Daniel Stouffer (Biological Sciences) received the award for their outstanding contribution to research at UC so early in their careers.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Steve Weaver says that Dr Bradley and Dr Stouffer showed exceptional talent in their respective fields, producing ground-breaking research that has real world applications.

“Brendon and Daniel are both inspiring future research leaders and this award recognises their contributions to their respective fields both nationally and internationally,” says Professor Weaver.

Dr Bradley is an earthquake engineer whose research speciality is the prediction of earthquake-induced ground motions and seismically-induced losses to infrastructure, while Dr Stouffer is a theoretical ecologist whose primary research focus is the study of complex species-species interaction networks.

Both Dr Bradley and Dr Stouffer were recently awarded prestigious 2013 Rutherford Discovery Fellowships, each receiving $800,000 over five years to help them further their research.

“It feels fantastic to be recognised as one of the emerging career researchers at UC and I am very much looking forward to what is to come in the following years with my research,” says Dr Stouffer.

Dr Bradley has helped produce more than 60 high impact journal articles and 101 conference papers in his four years at UC. Dr Stouffer has 25 peer-reviewed articles and one book chapter since 2005.

“Both researchers are highly regarded both within New Zealand and internationally. They both have very bright careers ahead of them,” says Professor Weaver.
