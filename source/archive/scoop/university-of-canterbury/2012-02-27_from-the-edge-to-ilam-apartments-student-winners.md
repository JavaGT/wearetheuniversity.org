**From the Edge to Ilam Apartments - Student Winners Claim Their Prize**  
  
**The lucky winners of UC Accommodation Student Village’s (UCA) Living on the Edge promotion are loving their on-campus Ilam Apartment prize.**  

Sarah Whitty and her friends entered a competition in August 2011 to win a five bedroom apartment at student accommodation complex, Ilam Apartments. The five bedroom apartment is fully furnished, warm, modern and comfortable. Ilam Apartments, who are managed by UC Accommodation Student Village, are popular with students seeking an independent flatting lifestyle on-campus. “The location is awesome” says Sarah, “I love how close we are to Uni.” The flatmates have enjoyed summer from their balcony which overlooks a grassed courtyard. “We’re stoked to be living in Ilam Apartments”. Sarah and her flatmates won the use of the five bedroom apartment for the entire academic year, “we don’t have to stress about paying rent for once, we can just focus on our studies and having a great year,” comments Sarah

2011 was the second year UCA ran the popular competition where students enter themselves and four lucky friends to win a modern five bedroom apartment, rent-free for the year. Over 1400 students entered the competition, where entrants were required to obtain a key code and get their friends to accept an invite to the flat before they could be locked into the draw. The Living on the Edge competition was created to encourage students to consider living on-campus in a vibrant student community whilst studying. The Ilam Apartments, situated on-campus at the University of Canterbury, are open to all tertiary students from first year right through to PhD level.

As well as winning the apartment rent free for a year, they also won $5000 worth of extras including vouchers for Satchmo Hair, the Fox & Ferret Riccarton, Northlands shopping mall and Bodyfix Gym – all organised by The Edge radio station. The total prize worth is more than $45,000.

UCA Sales & Marketing Manager Lucy Allen-King said the promotion was a great success. “We were overwhelmed with the student response to the competition and while there were many worthy recipients, it’s great to see some new faces at Ilam as a result of this promotion” says Allen-King.

With refreshed spaces and a revitalised team the year at UCA is off to a great start with an array of Orientation Week events “At Ilam Apartments students get all the benefits of a quality flat while still being in the centre of student life”, said Nik Webb-Shephard, General Manager of UC Accommodation Student Village.

UC Accommodation Student Village manage 1550 student beds in Christchurch including Sonoda Christchurch Campus & University Hall.
