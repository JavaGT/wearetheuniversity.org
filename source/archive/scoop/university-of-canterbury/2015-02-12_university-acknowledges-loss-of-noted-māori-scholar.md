University of Canterbury acknowledges loss of noted Māori scholar

February 12, 2015

The University of Canterbury today joined Ngāti Porou and tribal leaders throughout the country in acknowledging one of the great Māori scholars of our time, Dr Apirana Mahuika, who passed away this week.

Dr Mahuika had immense mana and demonstrated this by way of being a strategic thinker and influential orator. He was at ease in communicating with people regardless of the setting, but excelled in political interactions at all levels, and in academia.

University of Canterbury’s Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Māori) Darryn Russell says Dr Mahuika had an impeccable record of service to his people and to the nation.

The University’s Professor of Māori research, Angus Macfarlane, says Dr Mahuika had a knack of being able to ‘move people’.

“His presence was intellectually stimulating and culturally replenishing,” Professor Macfarlane says.

Dr Mahuika retained associations with many tertiary institutions and his link to the University of Canterbury was more aligned to his famous tipuna (ancestor) Sir Apirana Ngata who studied political science and law at Canterbury.

In 1893 Sir Apirana became the first Māori graduate to complete a degree at a New Zealand university. His legacy is framed around the well-known axiom ‘e tipu e rea’.

“This encourages people to grow and branch forth toward wholesome destinations. Dr Mahuika’s life was exemplary in that regard. Kua hinga te totara. A giant of the forest has fallen,” Professor Macfarlane says.
