**Top achievers win inaugural UC International College scholarships**

December 19, 2014

UC International College (UCIC) has announced the first two winners of the Navitas Academic Scholarships with Zhang Yuting and Wang Jiang Jun receiving the scholarships at a ceremony at the College yesterday.

Zhang Yuting is completing her UCIC programme in Commerce this semester and will pathway to the second year of her University of Canterbury Bachelor of Commerce degree in February 2015. She wants to major in taxation, but is also considering a double major.

Wang Jiang Jun is completing his UCIC programme in engineering and will pathway to his first professional year of his University of Canterbury Bachelor of Engineering with Honours degree in civil engineering in 2015.

UCIC College Director and Principal, Professor Peter Cottrell, presented the students with their certificates at an end of year celebration for all UCIC students and staff at the College today.

“Yuting and Jiang Jun have achieved exceptionally good academic outcomes and are ideal candidates to demonstrate the advantages of pathway programmes to University of Canterbury degrees,” Professor Cottrell says.

He also encouraged other UCIC students to study hard and achieve their goal of a University of Canterbury degree. More than 150 international students have begun their studies at UCIC since it started in late October 2013 and the first cohort of about 50 students will continue onto their University of Canterbury degrees in February 2015.

Professor Cottrell says that the international student growth at UCIC was significant for the University of Canterbury’s growth strategy and particularly significant in terms of the international student growth recovery for the Canterbury region. UCIC offers a New Zealand unique, alternative route into Canterbury for international students.

“The benefits for international students are enormous. UCIC is based on campus so students are immediately immersed into student life in New Zealand. Students have full access to University of Canterbury services and facilities but can also expect the renowned UCIC benefits, such as smaller class sizes, more support and an extended academic year. This truly gives our students the right tools to adapt and succeed,” Professor Cottrell says.

UCIC offers a range of programmes in science, commerce and engineering, delivering the equivalent of the first year of University of Canterbury bachelor’s degrees. On successful completion UCIC students pathway into the second year of their chosen bachelor degree at the highly ranked University of Canterbury. UCIC also offers a Foundation Studies Certificate for those students who have completed the equivalent of NCEA Level 2.

New Zealand’s second oldest university, the University of Canterbury is ranked in the top three percent of universities in the world and has a strong international reputation. The University of Canterbury’s College of Engineering is ranked amongst the best in the world for engineering and technology, with its world renowned civil and structural engineering ranked an outstanding 19th in the world according to the latest QS world rankings.
