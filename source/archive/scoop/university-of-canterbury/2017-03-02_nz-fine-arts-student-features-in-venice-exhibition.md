University of Canterbury Fine Arts Master’s student Jen Bowmast has been selected as a finalist in a prestigious international art competition with her artwork to be part of the Arte Languna exhibition at the Arsenale of Venice, in Italy, this month.

The Arte Laguna Prize is an international art award, aimed at enhancing contemporary art, with six cash prizes of €7,000 (NZ$10,000) among the prizes.

The only New Zealand finalist in the annual art competition, Jen’s selected work, _Poetics of Space_, is a finalist in the sculpture and installation category of the Arte Laguna Prize 16.17. She is one of 125 artists selected worldwide to take part in the contemporary art exhibition, from 25 March to 9 April. The exhibition attracts more than 3000 visitors every year.

The works by emerging artists have been through a strict selection process by 11 directors of museums and foundations, international art critics and curators.

This year the exhibition returns to the historic Arsenale of Venice with an original exhibition curated by Igor Zanti with the collaboration of ten well-known names from the international art scene: Flavio Arensi, Tamara Chalabi, Paolo Colombo, Suad Garayeva, Ilaria Gianni, Emanuele Montibeller, Salvador Nadales, Fatos Ustek, and Alma Zevi.
