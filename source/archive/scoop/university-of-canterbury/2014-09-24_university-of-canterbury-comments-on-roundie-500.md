University of Canterbury comments on Roundie 500
================================================

**University of Canterbury comments on Roundie 500**

The University of Canterbury strongly disapproves of the actions of a number of individuals involved in the recent ENSOC Roundie 500 event.

It is very clear that these students acted inappropriately and in a sexist and racist manner and provoked complaints to the University by other students.

The Roundie 500 event is an ENSOC event, not endorsed by the University Students Association nor the University.

Some of those involved exercised very poor judgment in relation to some of the themes and costumes. The University will investigate the complaints received as a priority.

The University expects a high standard of conduct of all its students and holds all students to account for their behaviour. It is concerned that students have made ill-informed decisions about the circulation of photographs on social media that would reflect poorly on them now and in the future.

The University will continue to work with UCSA to educate students as to appropriate behaviour in relation to such events.

ENDS
