UC researchers calculate the cost of smoking

November 27, 2012

With the price of cigarettes due to rise again on New Year’s Day, University of Canterbury (UC) researchers are interviewing scores of smokers about the cost of their smoking now and their smoking intentions next year and beyond, as the price of cigarettes continues to increase each year.

UC postgraduate psychology student Aimee Richardson will analyse the results from similar surveys in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin and on the internet. Richardson is working on a summer studentship to complete the research.

Her supervisor UC Professor Randolph Grace said he believed it was the first survey in New Zealand to ask smokers of their future smoking intentions with regard to price.

\`\`The research team will also ask how much the price of cigarettes has to increase before most smokers quit and whether, after puffing on an electronic (nicotine only inhaler) cigarette, smokers think they would quit any sooner or not.

\`\`Richardson will have the answers from the survey later next year. Her answers could affect how much government taxes cigarettes in future and whether sales of nicotine electronic cigarettes should be permitted,’’ Professor Grace said.

The research is being funded by Christchurch-based End Smoking NZ Trust, with a grant from the Canterbury Community Trust and the University of Canterbury.

Preliminary results will be presented to an international research meeting in Boston in March and to the government by April.

Although smoking has declined in recent years, 17 percent of adults still smoke, according to the Ministry of Health's latest annual report. One in six of all deaths in New Zealand are attributable to smoking, according to Dr Murray Laugesen, chair of End Smoking NZ. Those dying of smoking die 14 years earlier on average than non-smokers of the same age.

Professor Grace said he intended to continue the research next year to see if smokers' intentions remain the same over time. Those wanting to participate in the current survey could contact:costofsmokingstudy@gmail.com.
