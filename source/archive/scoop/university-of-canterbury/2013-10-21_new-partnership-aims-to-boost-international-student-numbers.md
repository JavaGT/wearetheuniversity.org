**New partnership aims to boost international student numbers at UC**

**October 21, 2013**

Global education provider Navitas Limited will next week open its doors as an affiliated college on the University of Canterbury’s (UC) campus to recruit and prepare international students for degree study at UC.

The partnership between UC and Navitas will allow international students to study first-year courses at the new UC International College (UCIC) and, on successful completion, enter their second year of study at UC. 

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the College will play an important role in attracting international students back to Christchurch, to the University and to the greater Canterbury region. 

\`\`The aim of UCIC is to contribute to a threefold increase in the international student population at UC within the next 10 years. This increase will benefit the entire region.’’

College Director and Principal of UCIC Professor Peter Cottrell, former head of the Department of Physics and Astronomy and academic dean of science at UC, says the programme is unique in New Zealand.

\`\`UCIC’s university transfer programme is the first of its kind to be delivered in New Zealand. International students will complete the equivalent of their UC first year programme at UCIC and then transfer, or pathway, into the second year of their UC degree programme.

\`\`Students will have full access to UC services and facilities so they will feel part of the campus immediately and it will make their transition into UC as students that much smoother.”

International students who just miss the entrance requirements in English language and other academic subjects will get the additional support and intensive tutoring and coaching needed to help them achieve their academic goals.

UCIC opens next Tuesday October 29 and will initially offer students a University Transfer Programme (UTP): Commerce, which is the equivalent to the first year of UC’s Bachelor of Commerce degree. In March next year, a UTP: Engineering will also be offered with additional courses in science and pre-masters to follow.

Orientation for UCIC will be held this week (October 24 and 25) with new students being jointly welcomed by Dr Carr and Professor Cottrell.

Navitas is a leading global education provider founded in Australia. It provides education training services in cooperation with leading universities in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, USA and now New Zealand. All courses are accredited through the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and quality assured by UC.
