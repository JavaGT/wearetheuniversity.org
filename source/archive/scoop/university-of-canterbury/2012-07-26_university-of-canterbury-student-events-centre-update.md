University of Canterbury Student Events Centre Update
=====================================================

**UC Student Events Centre Update**

An independent investigation commissioned by the University of Canterbury has attributed the underlying cause of a floor subsidence during a performance by hip hop artist Savage at the newly-opened student events centre to human error.

The investigation has found that a commercial structural engineer whose firm was contracted to contribute to the design of the events centre did not calculate a dynamic load for the floor, which meant its design was not adequate to support dancing by a large number of people.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says: \"The independent structural engineer's report that we commissioned is in the process of being peer reviewed. But, in the meantime, preparations are underway to have the floor repaired and the centre re-opened."

Dr Carr says while only a small area of the centre's total floor space was affected by the subsidence on 13 July, the entire floor area will be strengthened. It is anticipated that work will begin within a week, and will be completed within three to four weeks.

"We have appreciated the way in which our contractors have responded positively to this situation," he says.

University of Canterbury Students' Association President, Erin Jackson, says students are looking forward to seeing the events centre re-open.

"We hope that Savage may even be able to come back to Christchurch some time to finish his set."

Dr Carr says the findings of the investigation have been shared with relevant contractors.

The University will be making no further comment.
