**UC researcher wins inaugural women’s world croquet title**

**October 29, 2012**

University of Canterbury (UC) researcher Jenny Clarke has won the inaugural women’s world croquet title in Cairnlea, Victoria, Australia.

Dr Clarke yesterday won the final 3-0 to become the first women's world croquet champion. It was the first time anyone had won a world singles title without dropping a game.

UC Deputy Pro Vice-Chancellor Lindsey Conner said today Dr Clarke had been working toward the title for a number of years.

\`\`We are delighted for her to have achieved such high world recognition for her skills. She is a great role model to our students and staff in our physical education and sports coaching degree programmes.

\`\`Jenny achieves her goals while being an examplar of someone who advocates for fair play, ethical practice in sport and high achievement. We are extremely proud to have her as part of our teaching and research team,’’ Associate Professor Conner said.
