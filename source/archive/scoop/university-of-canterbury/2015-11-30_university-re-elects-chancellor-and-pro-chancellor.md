University of Canterbury re-elects Chancellor and Pro-Chancellor

The University of Canterbury Council has re-elected its Chancellor and Pro-Chancellor.

Current Chancellor Dr John Wood, CNZM, QSO, a former New Zealand ambassador, was re-elected for a third term.

Christchurch barrister and solicitor Ms Sue McCormack was re-elected Pro-Chancellor, also for a third term. Both appointments are for a two-year term to 31 December 2017, the first time an appointment to a two-year term has been made.

“I look forward to the exciting times ahead for the University as it continues on its significant campus transformation programme,” Dr Wood says.

“It’s a privilege to be appointed for a further two years to serve as Pro-Chancellor as the University continues to strengthen its important role in the new Christchurch,” Ms McCormack says.

Dr Wood has had a distinguished career in diplomatic service taking up Ambassador-level appointments to Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and twice to Washington DC. He was also New Zealand’s principal external trade and economic advisor and negotiator under successive governments. He is Chief Crown Negotiator for Ngai Tuhoe and for the Whanganui River negotiations.

He holds BA Hons and MA Hons from both the University of Canterbury and from Balliol College, Oxford. In 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Canterbury. Dr Wood has served on the University Council since 2007.

Ms McCormack is also a UC graduate, holding a BA and LLB. She has more than 25 years’ experience as a commercial and corporate lawyer and is a partner in Mortlock McCormack Law.
