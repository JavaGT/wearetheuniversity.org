UC strongly supports Callaghan Innovation’s direction

July 10, 2013

The University of Canterbury today welcomed the Callaghan Innovation’s first full three year Statement of Intent which has been tabled in Parliament.

Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Town, says Callaghan Innovation has an important role in delivering Sir Paul Callaghan’s vision of greater commercialisation of innovation in New Zealand.

\`\`Its initiatives will lead to greater investment in research and development and a more connected, collaborative and effective research sector across New Zealand.

\`\`The approach Callaghan Innovation is taking will have significant benefits for those working in research, firms doing business in New Zealand and the economy.

\`\`We note the decision by Callaghan Innovation to not take part in contestable funding bids. This policy is sensible and allows our researchers to work with Callaghan Innovation collaboratively and without our interests conflicting.”

Callaghan Innovation was established on February 1 this year with a mandate to accelerate the commercialisation of innovation in New Zealand firms, as an integral part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda.

Callaghan Innovation received funding in this year’s Budget of $166 million over four years.

The statement notes that over the first six months of the 2013/14 year Callaghan Innovation will be engaging in a process with its research teams to finalise which teams will transfer to other institutions such as Universities or CRIs.

\`\`We look forward to working with Callaghan Innovation including the potential to align research teams.

\`\`Without basic research, usually done in university laboratories, we would not have many items we now take for granted in health and society, for example the initial discoveries that led to MRI machines, large flat screen TVs or the electric car.

\`\`Research to enhance the capacity of New Zealand to use physical and engineering sciences for economic growth lists many areas currently being investigated by researchers in New Zealand.

\`\`This extra effort and focus on research across the board should achieve its desired outcome of growth for New Zealand more rapidly now,’’ Professor Town says.
