Silicon Valley and the pursuit of immortality

UC Connect public talk: _Never Say Die – Silicon Valley and the pursuit of immortality_

Death is a big business, which is one reason why Silicon Valley billionaires such as Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and Sergey Brin hope to disrupt the aging process and unlock the secrets of immortality. In an upcoming UC Connect | Tauhere public talk, _Never Say Die: Silicon Valley and the Pursuit of Immortality_, Associate ProfessorAmy Fletcher will discuss the use of emerging technology in age extension and the future of life and death.

“Bringing the same zeal for digitizing every aspect of our existence to the ‘problem’ of aging, these entrepreneurs are in a race to conquer the last frontier of human biology, hoping to find new fortunes and extended lifespans in the process,” Associate Professor Fletcher says.

“But what about the rest of us? How might we think about the political and economic implications of extended human lifespans?”

This free public talk (which will also be livestreamed on UC’s Facebook page), on Wednesday 31 July, focuses on the future of aging for the non-billionaires. It puts these technological innovations in a social context, and parses the hype from the hope and the science fiction from the science.
