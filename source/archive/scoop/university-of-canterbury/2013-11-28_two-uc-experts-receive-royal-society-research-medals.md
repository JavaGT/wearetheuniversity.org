Two UC experts receive Royal Society research medals

November 28, 2013

Two University of Canterbury (UC) academics last night received Research Honours Medals from the Royal Society of New Zealand.

Professor Dave Kelly received the Hutton Medal for his research into plant ecology and Professor Andy Buchanan won the RJ Scott Medal in recognition of his world-leading work in developing design techniques for large-scale timber buildings. The pair received their medals at an event in Dunedin.

Professor Kelly has made major contributions to New Zealand plant ecology across a range of areas. His hallmark is using long-term studies of South Island ecosystems to reveal the answers to fundamental questions of national and international interest.

He has used decades-long studies of variable seed crops in native plants to probe the evolutionary causes, the proximate climate triggers, and the eco-system consequences of this striking natural phenomenon, which is unusually common in New Zealand but is of interest worldwide.

His research has improved understanding of New Zealand eco-systems and provided tools for better conservation of the native flora and fauna. His work has appeared in top journals worldwide. He says he is delighted receive the highly regarded medal.

\`\`It's a great honour to be among such hallowed company. I'm also delighted that UC gets recognition for its support of my research over the years - without good backing and infrastructure the discoveries I've made would not have been possible.’’

Professor Buchanan is a major force in the international resurgence in the use of timber for large-scale buildings. Newer reconstituted timber products, such as laminated veneer timber, have predictable characteristics as well as being environmentally desirable.

He has developed methods by which joints in timber buildings can be designed to give in an earthquake while avoiding permanent damage or deformation.

The research efforts of Professor Buchanan and his team have lifted engineered timber buildings into serious contention for the Christchurch rebuild.

He received the New Zealand Institute of Architects President’s Award this year. His work has been recognised by the award of a Queen’s Service Medal in 2002 and by being elected a Distinguished Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand in 2011.

Professor Buchanan says the challenge of working with multi-storey timber buildings is in finding solutions to many inter-related problems.

\`\`These solutions are in the diverse areas of fire safety, earthquake resistance, durability, noise transmission and constructability.

\`\`The multi-disciplinary research team University of Canterbury has shown that it is possible to design timber buildings which are just as safe and economical as steel or concrete buildings, but with a much lower carbon footprint.”
