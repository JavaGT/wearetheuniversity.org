University of Canterbury graduate is awarded Allaboutthestory.com Media Scholarship

Allaboutthestory.com , the online marketplace for news stories and cartoons, is pleased to announce it has awarded the Allaboutthestory.com Media Scholarship to University of Canterbury graduate Natasha Turfrey.

Natasha, who has a post-grad Diploma in Journalism from the University of Canterbury and a BA in Film and Media from the University of Otago, is the first recipient of the award, which aims to strengthen links between the media and web development communities in New Zealand.

The scholarship allows Natasha to attend New Zealand’s best known web conference - Webstock –where she will have the opportunity to interview big names from overseas and fill her contact book with the good and great of New Zealand’s own web glitterati.

Allaboutthestory.com founder and managing editor Julie Starr says the scholarship package – which includes a ticket to Webstock, interviews with speakers, and a ticket to the Onya web awards and WordCamp – represents a great opportunity for a young journalist.

“We want to see more journalists in New Zealand get up to speed with what’s happening online and particularly in the online media space.

“It’s great to be able to help a young journalist at the beginning of her career get acquainted with people and ideas at the cutting edge of the web.”
