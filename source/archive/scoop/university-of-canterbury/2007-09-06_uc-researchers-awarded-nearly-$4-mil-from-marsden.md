UC researchers awarded nearly $4 million from Marsden Fund

University of Canterbury researchers have been awarded nearly $4 million in funding in this year's Marsden Fund round.

The awards, which are government funded, are administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand.

Canterbury University has secured grants for 10 research projects, totalling $3.86 million. They cover a range of topics such as changes in pronunciation of the Maori language and debris flow, to improving navigation within computer documents and the behaviour of enzymes.

Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Town, who oversees research at the University, says the grants illustrate the broad range of research undertaken at UC.

\"I congratulate our researchers on their successes. The fact that many disciplines feature in this year's round is a testament to the widespread commitment to research excellence here at Canterbury."

The UC principal investigators awarded funding are: Professor Leon Phillips (Chemistry), Associate Professor Andy Cockburn (Computer Science and Software Engineering), Associate Professor Peter Cottrell (Physics and Astronomy), Associate Professor Neil Gemmell (Biological Sciences), Associate Professor Margaret Maclagan (Communication Disorders), Dr Elisabeth Bowman (Civil Engineering), Dr Michael Albrow (Physics and Astronomy), Dr Jane Buckingham (History), Dr Raeburn Lange (Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies), Dr Emily Parker (Chemistry), Dr Jason Tylianakis (Biological Sciences) and Dr Jon-Paul Wells (Physics and Astrononmy).
