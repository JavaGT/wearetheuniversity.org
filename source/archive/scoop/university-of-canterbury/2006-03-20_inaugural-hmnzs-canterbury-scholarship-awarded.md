Inaugural HMNZS Canterbury Scholarship awarded

She’s an A student, but it is her leadership potential and her demonstration of qualities consistent with the Navy’s core values – the three Cs – that have earned Dominica Finch the inaugural HMNZS Canterbury Scholarship for 2006.

This prestigious scholarship was established by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) last year on the occasion of the decommissioning of the Leander frigate HMNZS Canterbury. It recognises the long and supportive relationship between the RNZN and the Province of Canterbury.

The scholarship is awarded on the basis of academic achievement, leadership potential, involvement in sport, cultural and community activities and demonstration of the RNZN core values of comradeship, courage and commitment.

Chief of Navy Rear Admiral David Ledson said that he was impressed by the standard of all the students who had applied for the Navy Scholarship, but that Dominica “was just that bit better”. He added that he was convinced “she will be a leader in whatever career she eventually chooses to follow”.

Dominica, who will study towards degrees in Arts and Law at the University of Canterbury, will receive $10,000 to cover her first-year tuition fees and a living allowance.

The former Villa Maria College student said being awarded the scholarship was totally unexpected.

“I was quite stunned but extremely pleased when I got the call, as the application and interview had been quite a challenge, so it was very uplifting to have succeeded.”

The 18-year-old is a talented violinist and was heavily involved in the music scene both within her school and the city. She was leader of the College’s orchestra and the Christchurch Youth Orchestra in 2005, played in various chamber music groups, tutored younger string players, and was a member of both the College’s auditioned choirs, the Chorale and Harmonia.

Dominica, who was Dux of Villa Maria in 2005, has a flair for languages and will major in Chinese at Canterbury, while keeping up her study of French. She also plans to take papers in History and Political Science, with the goal of a career in diplomacy.

In addition to receiving the HMNZS Canterbury Scholarship, Dominica was recently awarded the Christchurch Symphony F Stuart-Jones Scholarship, worth $500 to enable her to continue her musical studies while at University. Dominica was also named a UC Emerging Leaders’ Dux Scholar.

“The scholarships mean I won’t have to have a part-time job this year and will be able to fully concentrate on my studies and my music. Without this opportunity I would have had to give something away.”

Dominica will be honoured at a special award ceremony on Monday 20 March at 5.30pm in the Central Lecture Theatre Block at the University of Canterbury.

Also being honoured at the ceremony are the 63 recipients of the UC Emerging Leaders’ Scholarships.
