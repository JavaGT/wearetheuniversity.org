**Linguistics postgraduate wins UC thesis-in three-minutes award**

**August 16, 2013**

A linguistics PhD student studying English accents in non-native speakers has earned $5000 for winning the University of Canterbury’s fourth annual Thesis in Three annual event.

Ksenia Gnevsheva spoke at a packed lecture theatre on campus last night for three minutes about non-native English accents. Her prize money will be spent on research-related issues.

Biological sciences student Olivia Burge won $2000 for coming second with her presentation on regeneration within the Awarua-Waituna wetland complex, while mechanical engineering student Steven Banerjee received $1000 for third place following his talk on parallel cellular chips.

Fifteen students who reached the final were each given just three minutes to explain the what, why and how of their thesis. Funding was provided by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor’s Office.

Organiser of the event Professor Lucy Johnston said all the presentations were outstanding which made a difficult job for judges Andrew Ramsay (UC Students Association Vice-President); Associate Professor Janet Carter and Emeritus Professor John Burrows.
