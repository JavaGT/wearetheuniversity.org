Significant increase in applications to enrol at the University of Canterbury

December 14, 2012

Applications to enrol in the University of Canterbury’s 2013 first-year science and engineering courses are up 44 percent on this time last year.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr said overall, across all colleges, first-year domestic and first-year international student applications to enrol were up 20 percent - with first-year domestic student application numbers up 18.6 percent on last year and first-year international student applications up 23 percent.

While it will not be known until March whether all of these new students will study at UC, Dr Carr said their willingness to apply for enrolment demonstrated growing confidence in the University of Canterbury and Christchurch following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

“We know that some students apply to several universities and wait until the new year to make their final choice. But the fact these students want UC to be one of their options is very encouraging.”

Dr Carr says the University still expects overall student numbers to decline in 2013 due to the pipeline effect of reduced student numbers in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The University expects overall numbers to increase from 2014.

The University had put significant effort into recruiting new students. This would continue next year with the establishment of an international college in partnership with global education provider, Navitas, as part of a strategy to nearly double international student numbers within 10 years.

Dr Carr said the University contributed more than $1 billion to the local economy every year and attracting more students to Christchurch was one of the most significant contributions it could make to the Christchurch rebuild.

He said the increased interest in studying at UC reflected national and international recognition that Christchurch was a dynamic place to work and live.

“Lonely Planet puts Christchurch at number six on its list of Top 10 Cities for 2013, describing the city as ‘rising from the rubble with a breath-taking mix of spirit, determination and flair’.

“It says 2013 will be the year to join the rebirth of our city and, on the numbers so far, it appears young people in New Zealand and overseas are looking seriously at Christchurch.”
