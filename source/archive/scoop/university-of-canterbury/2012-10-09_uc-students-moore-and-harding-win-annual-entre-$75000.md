**UC students Moore and Harding win annual entre $75,000 Challenge**

University of Canterbury (UC) students Thomas Harding and James Moore have won UC’s student-run organisation entre $75,000 business challenge on campus in Christchurch tonight.

The entre business competition is in its eighth year. Entre is a not-for-profit, student-run company at UC Canterbury and aims to encourage and cultivate the entrepreneurial spirit among university students.

Harding and Moore of the AppointMe team won the grand overall category tonight. Their online based appointment service aimed to make the process of booking appointments simple and user friendly for customers.

Harding and Moore received a prize pack valued at over $30,000 to help further develop their venture. AppointMe also took out the Best Pitch category – joint winners with FODapp – a shopping application to assist people with special dietary requirements.

Most Entrepreneurial team went to Puteko Ltd and Most Improved Venture went to Euphroria Wake Lake. The powerHouse Ventures Incubator Prize was awarded to Alga BioPro Ltd and the PwC Most Market-Ready Venture went to INoMA Furniture.

The final stage of the competition was judged by a dragons den style competition. The judges - Andrew Lamb from the University of Canterbury, Nathan Wylie from PwC, Charlie Tomlinson and Simone Gale from powerHouse Ventures and Edward Sparrow from ANZ Bank – said they were impressed by the value of the students’ ideas, their passion for their enterprise, and the entrepreneurial spirit which the qualifiers displayed.
