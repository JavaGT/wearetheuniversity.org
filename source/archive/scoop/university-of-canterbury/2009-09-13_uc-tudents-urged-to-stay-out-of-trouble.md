University of Canterbury Students Urged To Stay Out Of Trouble

University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr notes that no UC students were among those arrested in Dunedin last night and is urging them to stay out of trouble tonight.

Dr Carr says the police have this afternoon confirmed that no University of Canterbury students were arrested in Dunedin. However, he is warning UC students that anyone identified by the police as being involved in illegal behaviour will face consequences. In extreme cases this could include exclusion from the university.

"First and foremost we expect our students to follow the laws of the land, and we support the police in taking action against any student involved in criminal behaviour.

"We have made it very clear to the organisers of the Undie 500, the Engineering Students' Society of Canterbury (ENSOC), and the students who registered to take part in the event that we will not tolerate illegal behaviour.

"My advice to our students who are still in Dunedin is to have a good time tonight, but stay out of trouble and keep your mates out of trouble because we know who you are and we'd rather not have to talk to you about your trip to Dunedin."
