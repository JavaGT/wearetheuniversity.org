Launched in 2021 in partnership with Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC)’s MBA programme, the Gough Family Foundation MBA Leaders Scholarship provides three annual scholarships to exceptional emerging leaders and is in its fourth year. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity offers them an invaluable chance to be mentored by top New Zealand leaders, grow their knowledge in leadership theory and practice through Outward Bound, complete a business master’s degree and join a cohort of other Gough scholars and mentors.

This year’s recipients are Summerset General Manager of Acquisitions and Development, Oliver Boyd; Harrison Grierson Principal Resource Management Planner Mary McConnell; and Bradley Ward, an Associate Urban Designer at Isthmus. All three are committed to making a difference in their communities and unlocking their full potential.

The mentors of this year’s recipients are Chair of Meridian Energy and Summerset Group Holdings Mark Verbiest; UC alumni, professional director, and independent organisational strategy and education consultant Gillian Simpson; and esteemed landscape architect Don Miskell ONZM, the man behind Christchurch’s post-earthquake, city blueprint.

Ben Gough, a leading businessman and founder of the Gough Family Foundation, is very excited to see another three talented young Kiwis join the programme and commit to learning and developing themselves. “These young leaders possess a combination of knowledge, humility, and a connection with their community, which are all essential components for thriving as leaders, locally or internationally,” Ben said.

The programme supports recipients to transform their visionary ideas into reality, focusing on projects that uplift individuals, businesses, and communities across Waitaha Canterbury and Aotearoa New Zealand. Through leadership development the scholarship has been developed to accelerate both personal and professional growth, empowering scholars to create lasting, positive change. Ben is a strong advocate for experiential learning, particularly in leadership development. As a result, Outward Bound have a close and enduring relationship with the Gough Family Foundation and will provide a tailored executive leadership course for the scholars and mentors at Anakiwa, in the Marlborough Sounds.

Scholarship recipients pursue a globally recognised MBA at triple crown accredited Te Kura Umanga | UC Business School, which recently became the first institution in Australasia to successfully complete the Business School Impact System assessment process.
