University of Canterbury Not Re-Opening Today
=============================================

University of Canterbury Not Re-Opening Today (Thursday)

Due to treacherous conditions on campus this morning after last night's freezing temperatures, ongoing safety issues created by snow-damaged trees and challenging driving conditions, the University of Canterbury will remain closed for the rest of today (Thursday). As a result, all activities on campus - including this evening's Community Education classes - are cancelled.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr expects the University will be open tomorrow (Friday). An update on conditions and confirmation of re-opening will be emailed to all staff and students late this afternoon, and posted on the UC website.

"We regret any inconvenience but the safety of our staff, students and contractors is paramount," he says.
