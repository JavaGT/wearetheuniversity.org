UC hits record number of Doctoral students

  

  
The University of Canterbury continues to punch above its weight in postgraduate achievement and research excellence with record numbers of doctoral candidates and thousands of postgraduates enrolled by mid-year.

UC has over 1,000 students enrolled in its PhD programmes for the third year running, having first surpassed the milestone in 2013.

With nearly 70% of the doctoral candidates in the Colleges of Engineering and Science, there are also over 400 PhD students in Arts, Humanities, Business, Law, Education, Health and Human Development disciplines.

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says that increasingly Canterbury is obviously where talent wants to be, as it’s affordable, accessible, creative, innovative and inspiring.

“These are some of the most talented, motivated minds around. The research they do supports the research of academic staff, advances knowledge and develops the next generation of academic leaders who will have careers not only in universities but also in research intensive and knowledge-based organisations,” he says.

Each year UC awards 70 new PhD scholarships ($21,000 per annum and fee waiver for three years) each valued at around $80,000 in total.

“This commitment represents a major investment by the University with over 20% of our PhD students on UC scholarships,” Dr Carr says.

By the end of July, there were 1016 PhD candidates enrolled at UC, plus more than 1600 Master’s students, contributing to a total of more than 3400 Postgraduate students.
