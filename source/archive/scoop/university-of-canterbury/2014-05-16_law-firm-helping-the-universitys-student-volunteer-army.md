Law firm helping the University’s Student Volunteer Army connect the community

May 16, 2014

University of Canterbury’s UC Student Volunteer Army will team up with law firm Duncan Cotterill this weekend to help the Ilam-Riccarton community in Christchurch.

The first drive to connect with the community was held in the Burwood suburb last year with the aim of bringing students and local residents together for a day of community action, connection and fun.

Student Volunteer Army president Bridget Williams says this year they decided to focus on the Ilam-Riccarton area as a way to empower students to volunteer, to enable them to see the difference they can make in their local community, and to forge a more positive relationship between them and local residents.

\`\`Volunteers will be divided into groups and dispersed across the Ilam-Riccarton area where, alongside staff members from Duncan Cotterill, they will be helping residents with gardening, baking, clearing graffiti and general maintenance.

\`\`Volunteers will, together with high school students from across the city, also be painting a mural on a wall at St Teresa’s School in the area.

\`\`As part of the event, all Ilam-Riccarton residents will be invited to attend a free community barbecue at the school. The SVA looks forward to connecting the community tomorrow and we are grateful to Duncan Cotterill for supporting the event,’’ Williams says.

\`\`We have over 1300 members and it's hard to say how many people we hope to help just one community. But we will take their rubbish to the dump, weed, mow lawns, chop wood, wash windows, paint murals, bake, and vacuum and do any general fix-it jobs.

Williams says a raft of other community service projects were planned for this year. The SVA was born on the streets of Christchurch after the February 22, 2011 earthquake to help with the liquefaction clean-up.
