========================================

**Public invited to farewell UCSA building**

For more than 40 years the University of Canterbury Students’ Association building has been a hub of student life, housing a radio station,_Canta_ magazine_,_ bars, a restaurant, and even a cat called Bentley.

But now it’s time to farewell the quake-damaged building. Badly damaged in the 2011 earthquakes, the UCSA building will be demolished in 2016. A new purpose-designed facility will replace it on the same site.

A farewell ceremony will be held on the Avon riverbank near the building on Thursday 10 December at 10am. The ceremony will be followed by refreshments at Bentley’s bar Events Centre, 90 Ilam Road, where initial design concepts for the new UCSA building will be on display.

University of Canterbury students and staff, both past and present, and the general public are welcome to attend the farewell ceremony.

“UCSA recognises there is significant history and many people have fond memories associated with building,” says UCSA President Sarah Platt.

The UCSA building was designed by architect Sir Miles Warren and opened in 1967. In 1970 planning for the first extension to the building began. Former MP David Caygill CNZM was the UCSA president at that time and worked closely with Sir Miles on the extension.

Current and former UCSA presidents Platt and Caygill will be speaking at the ceremony.

_\*Please note the UCSA building has been closed since the 2011 earthquakes. Internal access to the building is not possible for safety reasons._
