### UC’s School of Music Concert Series features fundraising Schubert performances from star classical pianist

The University of Canterbury’s School of Music has launched its Concert Series programme for the remainder of 2011. The programme features fundraising performances of Schubert’s piano sonatas by internationally acclaimed pianist Michael Endres. The first performance by Professor Endres is on 11 September. Entry to Professor Endres performances is by donation with the proceeds going to the NZ Red Cross Earthquake Appeal.

Professor Endres performs worldwide as a soloist and chamber music partner and is described by critics as “an outstanding Schubert interpreter”. Professor Endres gained his master’s degree at the Juilliard School in New York and has won prizes including Concours Geza Anda in Zurich and first and special prizes at the International Schubert Competition. He has an extensive and prizewinning discography of 27 cds. His latest Schubert recording (August 2009) was immediately awarded a Diapason d’Dor in France.

Leading US critic Richard Dyer from the Boston Globe called him ”one of the most interesting pianists recording today” and the New York Times wrote that ”the performances with pianist Michael Endres were revelatory”. Professor Endres joined the University of Canterbury as Professor of Piano in 2009.

“I have wanted to perform the Schubert sonatas as a means of making a fundraising contribution to my new hometown of Christchurch for some time,” said Professor Endres. “I am delighted that the concerts will now be taking place and hope that the Christchurch community will support all of the concerts in the School of Music Concert Series.”

“We are privileged to have a pianist and teacher of Professor Endres’ standing on our faculty,” said Pro-Vice-Chancellor for the College of Arts, Professor Ed Adelson. “Performances of the complete sonatas of Schubert by a major concert artist are a significant event. We hope that the Christchurch community enjoys the opportunity to hear his meaningful interpretation of Schubert’s sonatas and that they support the wonderful range of events on offer in the concert series.”

All concerts in the UC School of Music Concert Series are in the Jack Mann Auditorium (entry and parking off Solway Avenue). All concerts in the UC School of Music Concert Series for the remainder of 2011 are free with the option of providing a donation at the door.
