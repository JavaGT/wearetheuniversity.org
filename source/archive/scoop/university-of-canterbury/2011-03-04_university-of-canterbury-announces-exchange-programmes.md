University of Canterbury announces exchange programmes
======================================================

University of Canterbury announces exchange programmes with Auckland University, AUT University, Massey University, Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Waikato

The University of Canterbury is very grateful to universities throughout New Zealand for their involvement in an exchange programme announced today for domestic and international undergraduate students wanting to spend their first semester away from Christchurch in the wake of last week's earthquake.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the agreements confirmed today involve the University of Auckland, AUT University, Massey University, Victoria University of Wellington and the University of Waikato.

“Otago is considering signing up to the exchange agreement but we believe it needs other approvals before making any commitment,” Dr Carr says.

Lincoln University is offering support to other Christchurch-based institutions by providing access to space for teaching delivery.

\"I can appreciate the complexities involved in signing up to an exchange agreement like this at very little notice. This kind of thing would normally take years to co-ordinate. We are truly grateful to these universities for what they have achieved, working with us, in little over a week."

The agreement will allow undergraduate students already enrolled at the University of Canterbury to study at a partner university for the first semester of 2011. These students will return to Christchurch from the second semester to complete their UC degree programmes.

Dr Carr says all of the universities involved in the exchange programme have agreed not to charge fees for students who elect to spend the first semester away from Christchurch.

"What has been achieved reflects the widespread interest in the wellbeing of our students."

Dr Carr says students will be responsible for return transportation and other living/accommodation costs involved in relocating to partner universities.

  
Today's announcement comes as over 300 undergraduate students prepare to travel to Australia on Sunday to spend the first semester in Adelaide. The study abroad option is the result of an offer by the University of Adelaide as part of an existing relationship it has with the University of Canterbury.

Buildings on the UC campus are continuing to be inspected but not all teaching facilities will be certified safe within the next six to eight weeks because of a requirement to apply a comprehensive standard and a five-step process to full building certification.

“With this in mind, we have commissioned an additional 8,000 square metres of teaching space on the University Oval, the “Oval Village”. This will be available for lectures, seminars, study groups and open plan offices for staff.

“I continue to see no reason why we cannot deliver a full academic programme of teaching in 2011. We will institute a progressive re-start of teaching programmes from 14 March. The re-start process will take several weeks, with substantially all programmes starting by the end of March.”

A more detailed schedule will be made available on or before 8pm Monday 7 March.

“I strongly advise students not to make a decision until after the release of the progressive re-start programme at 8pm on Monday, 7 March. Further, students should always opt for an exchange rather than a transfer as the right to transfer already exists.”

The University of Canterbury has received a range of offers of support from universities in New Zealand. “We are very grateful for the assistance that we have received.”
