December 7, 2012

A second University of Canterbury (UC) academic has been appointed to the Marsden Fund Council which allocates millions of dollars of research funding every year.

UC geologist, Professor Jarg Pettinga, joins UC scientist Professor Juliet Gerard who was made Chair of the Marsden Fund Council earlier this year.

Professor Pettinga is an internationally-recognised earth scientist with a reputation for excellence in research and science management.

He is a current member of the Earth Sciences and Astronomy Panel of the Marsden Fund Council. He will take his place on the council for three years from December 2012 and will convene the Earth Sciences and Astronomy Panel.

This year, the Marsden Fund supported 86 new projects worth over $54.6 million.
