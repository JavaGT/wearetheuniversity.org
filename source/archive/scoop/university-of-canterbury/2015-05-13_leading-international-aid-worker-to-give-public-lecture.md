**Leading international aid worker to give public lecture next week**

University of Canterbury’s entrepreneur in residence and humanitarian and aid worker Linda Cruse will give a public lecture on campus next week about the importance of volunteering and how students can make a difference in the world.

Cruse has carried out humanitarian aid work in several natural disaster areas around the world including the Philippines 2013 typhoon, the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2005 Pakistan earthquake.

She has worked with Tibetan, Afghan, Burmese refugees and other challenged communities in the deserts of Uzbekistan, the Amazon jungle and the mountain nomads in the Himalayas and Atlas mountains. Her talk will be held on campus next Wednesday (May 20).

“Following the recent earthquake in Nepal, I will be sharing my experiences and knowledge of post-disaster Nepal, the country, people, resilience, successful models and approach to use in a developing country. I have worked on and off in Nepal since 2001 on various humanitarian projects in helping recovery post disasters.

“Fifteen years on the frontline as an international humanitarian worker working and living in some of the most challenging situations and conditions worldwide has taught me many things.”
