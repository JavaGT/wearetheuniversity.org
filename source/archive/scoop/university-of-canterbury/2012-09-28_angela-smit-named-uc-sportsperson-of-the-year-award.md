Leading NZ 800m runner Angela Smit named UC sportsperson of the year award

September 28, 2012

Leading NZ 800m runner Angela Smit last night won the University of Canterbury’s sportsperson of the year award at the annual sports Blues Awards on campus.

Smit made a dramatic breakthrough on the world scene this year with a personal best 800m in finishing second to Beijing Olympic Games 800m gold medallist Pamela Jelimo of Kenya at a track meeting in Belgium.

Smit won the national 800m title in Auckland in March and was second in the 400m and 1500m and is now ranked third on the New Zealand all-time list behind Toni Hodgkinson and Nikki Hamblin.

Crusaders rugby forward Luke Whitelock, athlete Hannah Newould and ice hockey player Jamie Lawrence were the other finalists. All Black rugby player Kieran Read is a former winner University of Canterbury (UC) sportsperson of the year.
