Exciting prospects ahead for Lincoln  

New Chancellor Tony Hall says Lincoln University has a bright future, with increasing student numbers and a big collaborative project in its planning stages.

Formerly Pro-Chancellor, Mr Hall has been elected to the position by the University Council after the retirement of Chancellor Tom Lambie to spend more time on his South Canterbury farm.

“Students have voted confidence in Lincoln by enrolling in increasing numbers, particularly in our land-based specialist programmes,” Mr Hall says.

“It’s an exciting time to be in a governance role at Lincoln as we progress the Lincoln Hub in collaboration with AgResearch, Plant & Food Research, Landcare Research and DairyNZ.”

Mr Hall has been on the Council since 2004.

He wants to highlight the attributes of the Council and the staff of the University, and the “extraordinary contribution they make to Canterbury and New Zealand”.

“I’m also looking forward to working with Professor Robin Pollard, our new Vice-Chancellor.”

Mr Hall lives on a small farm in North Canterbury, and has been involved with farming his whole life, he says.

He is Governing Director of Community Colleges New Zealand, University of Canterbury Council member, Chairman of the Mainpower Trust Board, and a New Zealand Olympic Committee board member and selector, among a number of other business and sporting roles.

He was awarded the Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2007 for services to the community.
