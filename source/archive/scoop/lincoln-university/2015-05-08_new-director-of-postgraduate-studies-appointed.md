New Director of Postgraduate Studies appointed

  
Professor of Food Science Charles Brennan has been appointed Lincoln University Director of Postgraduate Studies. He replaces Professor of Environmental Management Ken Hughey, who had held the role for 10 years.

Professor Brennan has been with Lincoln University since 2011 and in that time has overseen the establishment of new undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Food Science, and the formation of the Centre for Food Research and Innovation, of which he is the current director. He has also been involved in the development of the Food Innovation Network pilot plant hosted by Lincoln University.

He is a world-recognised researcher of food structure and function in relation to human nutrition, overseeing a team of 10 graduate and postgraduate researchers investigating the role of food processing and ingredients on diabetes, protein bio-availability, probiotics and Alzheimer’s.

Professor Brennan has produced more than 200 scholarly works and holds the position of Editor-in-Chief for three peer-reviewed journals, most notably the International Journal of Food Science and Technology.

The Director of Postgraduate Studies role aims to ensure excellence in all aspects of postgraduate education across the University. Lincoln has a strong focus on postgraduate education, with more than 500 PhD and postgraduate students.

The role has a new emphasis on providing strategic leadership relative to global trends in postgraduate research, and will include increasing research productivity, establishing skill development initiatives, programme reviews, policy development, and the internationalisation of Lincoln University’s postgraduate portfolio.

“The appointment marks an exciting strategic emphasis on postgraduate education, training and research,” says Professor Brennan.

“Lincoln University is recognised as a research intensive university, and with the upcoming redevelopment of the University as a major part of the Lincoln Hub, this new appointment will help establish a community for postgraduate students, not only within Lincoln University, but amongst our national and international collaborating partners.”
