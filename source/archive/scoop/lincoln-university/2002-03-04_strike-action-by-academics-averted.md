Strike Action By Academics Averted
==================================

**Monday, 4 March 2002, 9:56 am**  
**Press Release: [Lincoln University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University)**

1 March 2002

Planned strike action by Lincoln University academic staff on Monday 4 March has been called off following negotiations today (1 March) between Association of University Staff (AUS) representatives and the Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frank Wood.

While settlement has yet to be reached, good progress has been made, says the University’s Human Resources Manager, Luke Southorn.

“We are pleased that we have been able to avert compromising our students through strike action by academic staff,” says Vice-Chancellor Dr Frank Wood.

“It is an extremely difficult situation for everyone in a university which prides itself on its strong student culture.

“I am grateful that in spite of the pressure that continuing funding constraints are having on staff at Lincoln, and indeed across the tertiary sector, a sense of goodwill has prevailed.”

Both parties had worked very hard over the past few days to establish a base on which settlement might be reached and negotiations were continuing said the Human Resources Manager.

Both parties acknowledged the extreme difficulties the current situation was creating, he said.

“Clearly the achievement of Government’s stated social and economic goals will only be possible if a longer term solution is given priority at the highest level.”

Lincoln University Students’ Association President Greg Henderson congratulated the University and AUS on the progress they had made.

The President of the Lincoln University branch of AUS, Dr Jim McAloon, stressed that the Government must act urgently to address salaries and resourcing of universities.

“We are all agreed that this matter requires urgent political commitment,” said Dr McAloon.
