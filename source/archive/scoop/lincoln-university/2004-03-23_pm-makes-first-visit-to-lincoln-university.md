Prime Minister makes first visit to Lincoln University

In 90 minutes on campus the Prime Minister will open the Lincoln University-based National Centre for Advanced Bio-Protection Technologies, a $25 million Government investment in research and development in biosecurity, biocontrol, agri-biotechnology and Matauranga Maori bio-protection.

Financed through the Ministry of Education’s Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE) Fund, the new national centre is the only South Island CoRE of the seven established since the CoRE fund was set up in the 2001 Budget.

Headed by Lincoln University’s Professor of Plant Pathology Alison Stewart, the Centre is a 12-member collaboration of universities, Crown Research Institutes and a whare wananga. Its eight-member Board of Management is chaired by Alistair Betts of South Canterbury.
