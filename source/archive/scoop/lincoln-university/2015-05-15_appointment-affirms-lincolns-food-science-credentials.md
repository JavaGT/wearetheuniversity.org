Appointment affirms Lincoln’s food science credentials
======================================================

**Press Release: [Lincoln University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University)**

**Professor’s appointment affirms Lincoln’s food science credentials**  
  
Lincoln University Professor of Food Science Charles Brennan has been named incoming Editor-in-Chief for the _Journal of Food Processing and Preservation_.

He will share the role with Dr Brijesh Tiwari, a senior research officer at the Teagasc Food Research Centre in Ireland.

His appointment underlines the role Lincoln and its academics continue to play in the science and business of global food systems through such initiatives as the University’s Centre for Food Research and Innovation.

The international publication is described as the only journal dedicated to publishing both fundamental and applied research relating to food processing and preservation; benefiting the research, commercial and industrial communities.

The journal presents readers with the latest research and development in food processing, food preservation, and emerging technologies; and publishes stories concerning safe preservation and successful consumer acceptance of unique, innovative and non-traditional foods.

Professor Brennan considers the role an important one for disseminating knowledge on theoretical advancements which can then be transferred into applied solutions to the problems facing the food industry.

“I am humbled to have this opportunity to collaborate with colleagues around the world promoting research in the important field of food processing and preservation. All the more so considering New Zealand’s dependency on the food sector for its economic stability,” he says.

Professor Brennan is also the current Editor-in-Chief of the _International Journal of Food Science and Technology_.

Both journals are published by global publishing company, Wiley.
