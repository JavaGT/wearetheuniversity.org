**University leader’s award ‘highly deserved’ says Lincoln Chancellor**

The Officer of New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM) awarded to retired Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Emeritus Professor Roger Field was highly deserved recognition for a tertiary education leader who had given his heart and soul to serving New Zealand’s land-based interests through management of New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, said Lincoln University’s Chancellor Tom Lambie.

“The Lincoln University community is delighted that Professor Field’s career of more than 40 years as a university teacher, researcher and manager has been acknowledged in this way.

“New Zealand’s land-based industries are the powerhouse of our economy and through leadership at Lincoln University first as a Professor of Plant Science, then over the years 1993 – 2012 as progressively Pro Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Acting Vice-Chancellor and from 2004 Vice-Chancellor, Professor Field has made a remarkable contribution.

“The fruits of his leadership are to be seen in the thousands of graduates throughout New Zealand and the world who hold their qualifications from Lincoln University.

“Most recently the breadth and strength of Professor Field’s management skills were well seen in his leadership of the University during the period of the Canterbury earthquakes.

“National recognition in the 2013 New Year Honours, through the ONZM for services to education and land-based industries, is very highly deserved,” said Mr Lambie.
