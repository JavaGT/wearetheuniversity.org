Lincoln University Receives Positive Academic Audit Report

Lincoln University has been commended by the New Zealand Universities Academic Audit Unit for the extent to which the University has linked research to teaching and learning and for the degree of support it offers to students.

The Academic Audit Report of Lincoln University has been relased this week (2 Nov.). In this second cycle of audits by the AAU, two themes were investigated. The first, postgraduate and research activity, is a theme common to all universities in this audit cycle. In addition, Lincoln University selected ‘international activities and internationalisation’ as a second, institution-specific theme.

The report summary notes the “high standing in which many Lincoln University staff are regarded by international research communities” and commends the University for its efforts to develop links with local industry and external partner organisations in order to further strengthen its research capabilities.

The report goes on to say that Lincoln University has made “some creditable achievements in the context of internationalisation”. The Audit Panel also commented favourably on the manner in which the University, through its staff, manages both postgraduate and international students.

Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frank Wood welcomed the report of the AAU and, in particular, the recognition it gives to Lincoln University’s commitment to linking its research activities to its teaching.

“Our academic staff recognise the importance of using research to inform their teaching,” he says. “Students also appreciate the contribution to their learning experience from having teachers who are actively engaged in research.”

Dr Wood also agrees with the panel’s findings that Lincoln University has a genuine concern for both the welfare and academic progress of its students. Postgraduate students are generally very positive about their experience at Lincoln University. Considerable effort is also being made by the University to be responsive to the needs of its international students.

In its report the Audit Panel did identify some areas where Lincoln University can continue to improve its academic processes. In the main, these are areas where the University has already commenced activity to make improvements to both process and performance through its formal planning and self-review programme.

Dr Wood says he will continue working with staff and students to bring about improvements and that he sees the report as “a key step in continuous quality improvement and assurance mechanisms which are applied to all aspects of the University’s operations.”
