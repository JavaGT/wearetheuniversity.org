**Merged institutions will aid up-skilling of young ready for economic growth says Deputy PM at Telford ceremony**  

An entrance-way plaque marking the merger of Telford Rural Polytechnic, South Otago, and Lincoln University, Canterbury, was unveiled at Telford today (Friday 8 July) by the Deputy Prime Minister and MP for Clutha-Southland, the Hon. Bill English.

On 1 January this year, Telford Rural Polytechnic, founded in 1964 as a farm training institute, became Telford, a Division of Lincoln University, New Zealand’s third oldest university institution, founded in 1878 as a school of agriculture.

Lincoln University’s Chancellor, Tom Lambie, said the “vertical integration” provided by the merger offered “profound benefits” for educational provision in the agricultural and land-based sector, from sub-degree and undergraduate teaching and postgraduate research, to commercialisation and extension activities with industry.

Speaking at the unveiling, the Deputy Prime Minister drew attention to figures indicating that at the moment in New Zealand unemployment in the over 25-year age category was 4.6 percent in contrast to a disproportionately higher level of joblessness in younger age brackets.

Economic recovery made it important to have the young skilled-up ready to contribute to growth and capitalise on the career opportunities it would provide, he said.

Institutions like Lincoln University and its new Telford Division were experienced educational providers and had a significant role to play in providing the young with qualifications for fulfilling futures in a strong economy.

The former chair of the Telford Rural Polytechnic Council, David Yardley, said he and former Council members remained confident that a merged institution was the correct vision for the advancement of agricultural training in New Zealand. The Telford Division of Lincoln University would play a “tremendous and valuable role” in this for many years to come.

“More than ever this nation and the world needs farmers,” said Mr Yardley.
