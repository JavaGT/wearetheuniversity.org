Uni Scholarships Not Just For Elite Students, Youth Or Sporting Legends

Despite the impression that many students and parents may have about scholarships, the awarding of academic scholarships is not solely determined by getting 'Excellence' NCEA grades or by excelling in sports.

Scholarships manager at Lincoln University, Jane Edwards, says there are some misunderstandings around the issue of scholarships.

"We are looking for a lot more people to start thinking about applying for scholarships, which are worth many thousands of dollars across the board.

"Some are quite specific, but others are very general and just require a university entrance qualification.

"We encourage anyone who is a good "B" or Merit student to apply for as many scholarships as seem to be appropriate – and if they are not successful the first time, they should continue to apply. The chances of being successful are actually quite high and definitely worth the few hours of sitting at the computer and researching what is available."

Jane says the new mid-year Lincoln Alumni Bursaries are a great example of broad ranging opportunities open to students from around New Zealand and also internationally.

"For the first time, the Alumni Bursaries are being offered to students starting Lincoln mid-year, which is a great opportunity to put $2,000 towards tuition fees and reduce their student loan commitments. Applications for those bursaries are being accepted during June for study starting early July."

Annual fees for students at Lincoln University range from around $3,800 to $4,500 per year, depending on the course of study, so a $2,000 scholarship makes a significant difference.

Some of the scholarships on offer pay for full tuition for the duration of university study, and some also cover accommodation and other costs associated with attending the university.

In some instances, the organisation or company sponsoring the scholarship is also interested in employing the successful recipient for holiday work and for possible full time employment once they graduate.

A number of scholarships require the applicants to be currently resident or originally from specific areas of the country – outside of Canterbury, but do not specify where they should be carrying out their studies. So for example, students may come from the Palmerston North area, be eligible for the Don Linklater Memorial University Bursary and carry out their degree studies at Lincoln in resource management or environmental planning.

Edwards also says that in some cases, scholarships are targeted specifically at assisting those who could not otherwise afford tertiary study.

"Anyone who would like to carry on to get a degree or diploma but never thought they would financially be able to do so, should take some time to explore the opportunities available, she said.

"They apply to undergraduates and to postgraduates, for example women over 35 who wish to study towards a change of career."

Lincoln has many students who are coming back to study courses for the Wine, Food and Transport industries after successful professional careers in other fields, ranging from law to accountancy.

"Men and women in their late 30s and 40s often get to a place in life where they are seriously considering a change in direction, going back to study and establishing a new career.

"Anyone in that situation should also be looking at what funds are available that might make it easier financially to take the steps to move out of their existing profession and into a new one."

Lincoln University scholarships have a range of closing dates and criteria and details can be found through the Lincoln website www.lincoln.ac.nz/scholar or by contacting Jane Edwards at the university.
