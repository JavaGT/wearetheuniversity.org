Lincoln Vice-Chancellor retires

Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Dr Frank Wood has retired on medical grounds, from today. (6.10.03)

Chancellor Margaret Austin has accepted the resignation with regret and acknowledges Dr Wood’s contribution to the University and the tertiary education sector.

Mrs Austin has appointed Lincoln’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roger Field, as Acting Vice-Chancellor.

Professor Field has been Deputy Vice-Chancellor for the past five years and is no stranger to the Acting Vice-Chancellor’s role having filled it for seven months prior to Dr Wood’s appointment in March 1997.

Dr Wood came to Lincoln from a background of science management and was Chief Executive of the New Zealand Forest Research Institute, Rotorua, at the time of his appointment.
