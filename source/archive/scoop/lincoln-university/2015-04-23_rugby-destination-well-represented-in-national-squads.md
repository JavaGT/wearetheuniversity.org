‘Rugby destination’ well represented in national squads

  
Lincoln University is fast becoming a ‘rugby destination’ with 10 division one players away representing New Zealand this month.

The side has a big representation in the New Zealand Under-20 squad heading to the Gold Coast for the Oceania Junior Rugby Championships and then onto the Junior World Championships in Italy in June, with five players out of the overall eight from Canterbury.

Another five are off to Japan as part of the New Zealand Universities team for a three-match tour.

The side has won the Hawkins Cup for the last two seasons in the Christchurch Metro competition and is on the top of the table, and unbeaten this season.

“Success breeds success, and Lincoln is now being seen as a place of destination for rugby,” head coach John Haggart says.

Many of the players are on sports scholarships and come to the Lincoln University club from around New Zealand.

Mr Haggart says they can see there is plenty of opportunity to become a better player and gain a meaningful qualification.

Twin brothers Josh and Jack Goodhue, a lock and second five respectively, have made the Under-20 side, along with Hamish Dalzell, Tom Hill and Mitchell Dunshea.

Jack has already played for the All Black Sevens, and for the Canterbury ITM Cup side, and is described by Mr Haggart as having a “big future”.

Hamish, from North Canterbury and a relation to the Whitelock rugby clan, has had success in his second year at Lincoln University.

“He was at Lincoln last year but suffered from glandular fever and missed our premier colts’ squad, and played division two. It was a great experience for him playing against men and he is still eligible for New Zealand Under-20 next year,” Mr Haggart says.

Tom joined the club this year after being at HSOB in 2014, while Mitchell is a product of Lincoln High School.

Mr Haggart says Mitchell has made the transition to division one this year with ease.

They are following in the footsteps of Lincoln players like All Black Dom Bird, and Crusaders Jordan Taufua and Scott Barrett, who have all been in the Under-20s.

Tom Sanders, himself an Under-20 rep last year, is part of the New Zealand Universities team, after being released from the Crusaders to go to Japan, along with Jack Stratton, who has been a back-up halfback for the Crusaders, Nick Werahiko, Ere Enari and Broc Hooper.

Tom also played in the ITM Cup last year for Canterbury while the others are all in the Crusader Knights.

Reflecting on why the Lincoln side has such a big representation in the national squads, Mr Haggart says players were developed through establishing good structures, organisation and enjoyment.

“This comes from playing a brand of rugby that allows them to express their skills. We use a lot of video analysis to assist with learning and promote a self-driven environment.”

Ensuring we have good people in our coaching and management teams and having fantastic support from the University and scholarship programme all add-up to a successful outcome, he says.
