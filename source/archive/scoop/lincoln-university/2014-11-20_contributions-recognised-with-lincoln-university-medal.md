Between them former Lincoln University academics Dr Warwick Scott and Dr Rowan Emberson have taught and conducted research at the institution for 72 years, but it was not that which was being recognised at a ceremony there yesterday.

The pair were each awarded the Lincoln University Medal, an honour which acknowledges those who, in the opinion of the Lincoln University Council, have provided long-term meritorious voluntary service and support which has enhanced the fabric or reputation of the University.

Dr Scott worked as a plant scientist at Lincoln for 39 years, retiring in 2009 as a senior lecturer. However, for the last 14 years he has been part of the ANZ Young Farmer Contest, initially setting the questions for the contestants, with his growing contribution recognised when he was named its first patron in 2012.

He said the competition showcased agriculture to urban audiences, for whom it was essential to understand the depth of talent in the agricultural sector and its importance to the economy.

Dr Scott also brings a common touch to scientific issues to reach a wider audience, reflected in his columns for the Countrywide website, which cover a range of topics-from his opinions on organic versus conventional farming, to the science behind feed surpluses due to climate change.

As a researcher Dr Scott conducted important work on subterranean clover, cereals and forage crops, and he used a Nuffield Fellowship to spend a year overseas at the Plant Breeding Institute at Cambridge.

Dr Emberson became a lecturer in entomology at the then Lincoln College in 1968. He retired 33 years later in 2002, but never really severed his ties with the institution.

Since his retirement he has continued his association with the University as an Honorary Senior Lecturer and has continued to advise many of the entomology postgraduates at Lincoln University over the last decade for both the Department of Ecology and the Bioprotection Centre.

He has continued to contribute to the field of entomology with the results of his classification work on mites being used internationally He spent much of the last decade working with the Department of Conservation surveying invertebrate diversity for the Tenure Review process in Canterbury and Otago, and has assisted with the development of the Threatened Species List.

Lincoln University Chancellor Tom Lambie said both medal winners epitomised the commitment of staff to Lincoln University, having made a huge contribution to enhancing the fabric or reputation of the University far above and beyond their paid employment.

‘’ Warwick’s passion for the Young Farmer Competition and Rowan’s for entomology have benefited generations of aspiring youngsters in these fields,” he said.

The Lincoln University Medal

Introduced by Lincoln University Chancellor Tom Lambie in 2008, the award is a cast bronze with the words “for meritorious service” engraved upon it.

The criteria for the award includes anyone who has provided long-term meritorious voluntary service and support to the fabric or reputation of Lincoln University.

The recipient may be a staff member, Lincoln University graduate, or a member of the Lincoln community.
