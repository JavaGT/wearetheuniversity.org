Lincoln University’s collegiality, optimism and resilience recognised in independent audit

The New Zealand Universities Academic Audit Unit (NZUAAU) today released the results of the independent academic audit undertaken for Lincoln University as part of the ongoing quality assurance of New Zealand’s universities.

The current cycle of audits of all eight New Zealand universities is the 4th cycle since NZUAAU was established in 1993. NZUAAU’s role is ‘to consider and review New Zealand universities’ mechanisms for monitoring and enhancing the academic quality and standards which are necessary for achieving their stated aims and objectives, and to comment on the extent to which procedures in place are applied effectively and reflect good practice in maintaining quality’.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West joined Lincoln University in April this year and was immediately involved in the audit process. “It has been a challenging couple of years for Lincoln University so it is in many ways reassuring to have an independent assessment of our academic quality to show us that we are still doing what we do, well. In particular the NZUAAU panel recognised and commended the collegiality, optimism and resilience of the staff and students over the last couple of years (following the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes) – and I thank them for that.

“This constructive and helpful academic audit report is built on a comprehensive self-review undertaken by the University. I would like to acknowledge the leadership and contribution of Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic) Professor Sheelagh Matear and Dr Gill Jordan in co-ordinating and preparing the self-review,” said Dr West.

Director of the NZUAAU, Dr Jan Cameron, also noted the ‘significant achievement’ of the University for submitting on schedule a full self-review portfolio despite the disruption caused by unprecedented snow days and the impact of the Canterbury earthquakes on buildings, students and staff.

As part of the audit report the panel makes a number of recommendations, which the University will be incorporating into its strategic planning and development activities.

On release of the report, the Chair of the panel and Dr Jan Cameron as NZUAAU Director will discuss with Lincoln University the preferred procedures to be used in follow-up to the audit and the monitoring of follow-up activities. Lincoln University will provide a formal report against the recommendations in late 2013.
