Lincoln University welcomes 2016 budget news

Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Robin Pollard, says the specialist land-based university welcomes the 2016 budget announcement as “not only an encouraging budget for universities, this is a good budget for the future of New Zealand’s primary sector and the New Zealand economy as a whole.”

Specific tuition subsidy increases in agriculture (by 16%) and science (by 5%) enable Lincoln to continue to produce the right kind of graduate to grow the sectors that are instrumental to New Zealand’s economic growth and environmental wellbeing.

"Lincoln University embarked on a strategy to provide education and research that contributes to people living well, feeding the world, and protecting the future. Agriculture and science are key to New Zealand's well-being, and the budget decisions will move us in the right direction", Professor Pollard said.

"The additional funding will help ensure that students who choose Lincoln University will continue to receive an excellent education with ready access to a broad range of jobs in critical areas following their studies."

Lincoln University is the smallest in New Zealand, with a specialist focus on teaching and research in the land-based sectors. Lincoln is ranked in the top 3% internationally and is highly regarded for its research outputs within these sectors, and as such the increased investment in science and innovation is also particularly welcome.

The overall investment of $761m in areas including science, skills and tertiary education shows the Government’s commitment to the future of the young people of New Zealand and to the economy and environment.
