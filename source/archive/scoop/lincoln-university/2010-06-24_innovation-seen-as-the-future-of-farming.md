Innovation seen as the future of farming

**Innovation seen as the future of farming in the South Island**

The Lincoln University Foundation’s showcase event – the South Island Farmer of the Year has undergone a makeover with the focus shifting to innovation for its 32nd year.

In 2009 the event was put on hold while an effectiveness review was carried out. The review called for the event to adopt only one category rather than changing it each year – previously a farmer would have to wait up to a decade before their category came up again.

Lincoln University Foundation chairman Neil Taylor says it was decided the theme should be innovation and the competition should be open to all types of farming.

“The revamped event will acknowledge outstanding and innovative farm management practice and farmers’ contribution to leadership in land-based production.

“Innovation enables South Island farmers to keep ahead of the rest of the world. We want to encourage farmers to continue to innovate to ensure we are able to meet the world’s growing demand for food, to ensure we remain cost competitive while at the same time improving the health of our natural environment.”

The innovation theme has attracted a new prize to the event. A TM465 GPS system, kindly donated by TracMap, will be awarded to the farmer who best illustrates cutting edge implementation of innovation on their farm.

The major prize of a $15,000 travel/education grant (one of the largest rural cash prizes in Australasia) and a runner-up prize of $7,500 travel/education grant remains the same.

The focus on innovation has attracted three major rural South Island companies. They are:

**RX Plastics** from Ashburton is well-known throughout New Zealand and overseas for its unique K-Line irrigation system, PVC, polyethylene and rotamoulded product range, hard-wearing plastic pipe fittings and effluent disposal and treatment systems.

**Summit Animal Health’s** products are made in New Zealand for New Zealand faming conditions. They provide the country’s farm animals with a supplementary source of sodium and other trace minerals which are essential for production and health.

**TracMap**, based in Mosgiel, produces award winning global positioning sytsems for New Zealand farming conditions. The GPS systems make operating vehicles and managing staff on the farm easier and more profitable.
