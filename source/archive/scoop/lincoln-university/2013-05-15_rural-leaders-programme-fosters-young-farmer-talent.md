Rural leaders programme fosters Young Farmer talent

Lincoln University’s Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme is helping to shape the future of agribusiness and rural affairs in New Zealand. The alumni list already includes an impressive list of successful New Zealanders, including DairyNZ Chairman John Luxton and Rt. Hon Dame Jenny Shipley. Upon completion of this year’s programme, two Young Farmer Contest winners will be joining that list.

Each year, in partnership with the Young Farmer Contest, Lincoln University offers a Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme scholarship as part of the first prize package. The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme has been designed for people who have demonstrated their commitment to rural New Zealand and shown willingness to take on leadership roles. Only 20 applicants are accepted each year.

2012 Young Farmer Contest winner, veterinarian Michael Lilley, and 2011 Young Farmer Contest winner, William Grayling, are both attending the course this year on Lincoln University scholarships.

Based in Murchison, Mr. Lilley has leadership aspirations within the rural community and wider farming industry – something that he says he is looking forward to learning more about through the programme.

“I hope to learn the sort of skills I can take forward, not only in my own business, but also in future ventures,” says Mr. Lilley. “We’re only partway through the programme, but I’ve already learnt a lot about leadership, public speaking and teamwork.

“I am particularly interested in farm governance and the reasons for farms having or not having a Board of Directors – and how this affects the decision making process.”

Lincoln University has been involved with the leaders programme since 1976, when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. The yearlong programme will next year celebrate its thirtieth intake of students in New Zealand.

Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme Academic Director, Dr. Patrick Aldwell, says there is often a misconception about the course being just for farmers or people specifically in the agricultural sector.

“The programme is not just for those who work specifically in rural or agricultural businesses, but also for anyone who lives and works within a rural area or community,” says Dr Aldwell. “Over the years, we’ve had a wide range of applicants – from nurses to school principals, and bankers to politicians. This year, one of our successful applicants is a veterinarian – a first for the course.

“There have been previous attendees that have gone on to do amazing things for rural New Zealand, but what the programme really does is contribute to the next generation of leaders – something the rural community is lacking of late,” says Dr. Aldwell.

The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme aims to provide participants with the confidence and skills to take the next big step and encourage them to step outside their comfort zones when it comes to setting goals and aspirations. Dr. Aldwell says the programme references an acronym – FEAR – throughout the course when teaching participants these skills.

“The FEAR acronym – False Expectations Appearing Real – is about getting people to look outside the box and expand their horizons,” says Dr. Aldwell. “Every time a participant achieves something or completes a task that they wouldn’t usually do, it expands their comfort zone, and boosts confidence and self-esteem.

“Often the lack of confidence or fear of failing is what stops people taking the next step. This programme stands to alleviate these obstacles, and it is one of the reasons why the course has produced so many past and future New Zealand leaders.”

The Kellogg Rural Leaders Programme incorporates residential workshops, seminars and personal study over an 11-month period. The first stage is a ten-day residential induction course at Lincoln University at the beginning of the year, where participants focus on the dimensions that make a leader.

In the second, non-residential phase, participants select a topic of interest and complete a research project, which is presented to their fellow Kellogg participants in phase three at Lincoln University. The course then moves to Wellington for two and a half days for attendees to study the mechanism of government and the political process. They are also able to interview chief executive officers, politicians and other industry leaders about the practical nature of their leadership styles.
