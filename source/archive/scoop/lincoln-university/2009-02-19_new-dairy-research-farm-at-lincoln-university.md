New Dairy Research Farm at Lincoln University enhances South Island dairying centre of excellence

The establishment of the first dedicated dairy research farm in the South Island, which will be located at Lincoln University, was announced today (19 Feb.) by Professor Keith Cameron at a South Island Dairying Development Centre Focus Day.

Making the announcement on behalf of Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roger Field, Professor Cameron said that the development will create a “companion farm” to Lincoln University’s existing, highly regarded, 186-hectare commercial demonstration Dairy Farm.

The new 56-hectare, 170-cow Dairy Research Farm, will be located across the road from the central campus on land owned by the University. In collaboration with DairyNZ it will enhance Lincoln as the South Island dairying centre of excellence.

The new Dairy Research Farm will boost research collaboration with DairyNZ and other key research providers. One of the first pieces of research on the farm will be a joint project between DairyNZ and Lincoln University to evaluate and improve dairy cow nutrition in a way that reduces the environmental impact of dairying. This work will be led by Associate Professor Grant Edwards of Lincoln University in collaboration with DairyNZ scientist Dr Dave Clark.

The irrigated property will be a factory-supply operation, with cows wintered off the farm. A sophisticated dairy shed with a high degree of automation is planned and there will be separate feed and laboratory areas and staff rooms. The first milking is expected in August this year.

In recent years dairying research at Lincoln University has occurred within the constraints of the 680-cow commercial demonstration farm, established in 2001 to demonstrate best practice in sustainable, profitable dairying. Key outcomes from the demonstration farm have included environmental monitoring, development of the eco-n nitrification inhibitor technology, and pasture-based productivity that has placed the farm in the top 1% in New Zealand for performance.

The new farm will have the ability to generate sustainable revenues from the sale of milk, however its main purpose is to provide a research centre for South Island dairying development.

 “The time to develop a dairy research farm is opportune given the need for more South Island dairy research and teaching,” says Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roger Field. “Lincoln University is keen to build critical mass in dairy research and teaching and harness the combined strengths of the University and its colleagues for the benefit of South Island farmers.”

Research opportunities on the new farm include investigating dietary effects on greenhouse gases, animal health and productivity. A key challenge is to produce higher yields of high quality feed with a better balance of nutrients provided within the entire lactation and reproduction cycle.

“Projects on the new Dairy Research Farm will complement work on the existing Lincoln University commercial demonstration farm and collectively provide a continuum from component research on soils, plants and animals through to farmer uptake,” says Associate Professor Edwards.

Conversion of the land into a Dairy Research Farm is being project managed by Max Duncan, well known for his expert handling of numerous dairy conversions in Canterbury including the Lincoln University Dairy Farm.
