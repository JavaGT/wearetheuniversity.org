As the 10-year anniversary of the Canterbury earthquakes draws near, a Lincoln University academic is conducting the first in-depth study of the legacies of the spontaneous collective student action that took place in the aftermath of the disasters.

Environmental Policy lecturer Sylvia Nissen has received a $300,000 fast-start award from the Royal Society Te Aparangi Marsden Fund to research the long-term effects of the student mobilisation, which remains one of the largest youth-led movements in New Zealand in recent years.

The Student Volunteer Army was one of the most striking results of the mobilisation, arising from young people’s desire to help address community needs in the recovery period after the earthquakes.

“In an era of a global rise in student protest, this research offers a unique opportunity to examine how moments of significant collective action can affect young people’s political lives,” said Dr Nissen.

“Previous research has shown that moments of significant collective action can have subtle but substantial implications for participants, as well as for the wider political environment over time.

“However, we have little understanding of the effects of the student action in Christchurch.”

Using archival research, interviews and a survey, the project involves collaborating with researchers from the University of Canterbury Arts Digital Lab.

“The study will provide novel insight into emerging forms of political participation among young people, as well as the ideas and practices associated with civic volunteering,” said Dr Nissen.
