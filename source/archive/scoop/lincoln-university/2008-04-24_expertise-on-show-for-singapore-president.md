Lincoln University´s expertise on show for Singapore President

Lincoln University acknowledged expertise in sustainability issues and its research strengths in the biological sciences will see Singaporean President SR Nathan visit the campus on Sunday (27 April) on the opening day of his first state visit to New Zealand.

The New Zealand Government is keen to promote further collaboration between New Zealand and Singapore in areas such as scientific research, education and sustainability issues, and at Lincoln University President Nathan will receive a full briefing from the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roger Field, about the institution´s specialised capabilities.

The President and his party of Ministers, MPs and officials will then visit Lincoln University´s state-of-the-art diary farm where they will view milking in progress and receive an overview of the South Island Dairying Development Centre from its Executive Director Richard Christie.

The visit will also see President Nathan and his wife Urmila Nandey meet Singaporean students studying at Lincoln University. In particular, Lincoln University has a number of Singaporean enrolled in Landscape Architecture.

On completion of his Lincoln University visit, the only visit to a full New Zealand university campus scheduled during his New Zealand tour, the President and his party depart for Wellington, where there is a formal dinner reception at Government House. He leaves New Zealand on Wednesday night.
