**Lincoln joins five star constellation**

Lincoln University’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, International and Business Development, Jeremy Baker, says the University’s new QS five star rating highlights the comprehensively high level Lincoln has been performing at for a long time.

“We know we’ve been achieving it, now the rest of the world is finding out”

QS Stars is a worldwide university rating system which allows students “to get a wider picture of an institution’s qualities, looking at everything from the employability of graduates, to sports facilities and community engagement”.

It evaluates an institution against over 50 different indicators, and awards universities between one and five + stars over eight wider fields, as well as an overall rating.

Teaching is Lincoln’s strongest category, with maximum scores on three criteria — faculty student ratio, overall student experience, and student satisfaction with teaching— for a five-star category rating.

Other five star categories for Lincoln include: employability, with top scores in graduate employment rate and career service support: internationalisation, with maximum scores in institutional research collaborations, international faculty and international students: facilities, as student accommodation, library and medical facilities were all at a maximum: Inclusiveness, with full points in scholarships and bursaries, disabled access, and gender balance.

Mr Baker describes the rating as something which all staff can be proud of, as it shows their efforts in maintaining a high standard for their students is recognised and indicates to potential student, both here and overseas, Lincoln is a world class choice.

The ranking comes on the back of an increase in September to 373 in the recent QS world ranking, while Lincoln is also ranked as the 13th best small university in the world.
