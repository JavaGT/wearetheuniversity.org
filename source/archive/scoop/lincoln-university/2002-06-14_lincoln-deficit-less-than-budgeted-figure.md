Lincoln deficit less than budgeted figure  
\- gratifying result says Vice-Chancellor

A $1.4 million reduction on its budgeted deficit of $2.1 million for the 2001 financial year has seen Lincoln University emerge with an operating deficit for the period of less than a million dollars - $749,000.

“It’s gratifying to be able to present a positive report for 2001 given the challenges that Lincoln and the tertiary sector as a whole faced during the year,” says Vice-Chancellor Dr Frank Wood in the University’s Annual Report just released.

“Against a background of reduced Ministry of Education funding, continuing fees stabilisation policies and a reduction in domestic student enrolment the 2001 result is a respectable outcome.”

Lincoln University has received a wide range of positive feedback relating to its positioning and strategic approach in 2001, reports Dr Wood, and he says that a high  
level of involvement with key stakeholder groups during the year as they have gone thorough their own repositioning and development has reflected well on Lincoln’s standing and on the quality and breadth of the partnerships and networks that the University has grown.

Highlights of Lincoln University’s performance in 2001 include research income of $5.569 million, an increase of 18% on 2000, with research income over the last five years almost doubling; 81% of first year students expressed satisfaction with their decision to enrol at Lincoln and 86% of graduates reported satisfaction with the quality of their course of study. Growth in a number of areas including PhD enrolments up 5%, 40% growth in graduate and undergraduate diploma and certificate courses, 4% increase in international student EFTS and 43% growth in regional education enrolments. The launch of the South Island Dairying Development Centre, incorporating the University’s new Research Dairy Farm, is another highlight mentioned by the Vice-Chancellor in the Report.

“Being a small university has provided advantages during these times of change,” he says. “We have been able to move quickly and be proactive in developing new activities. We have been able to redevelop and personalise external associations and partnerships. Perhaps above all, we have been able to hold closely to our values in supporting our widely acknowledged focus on student relationships and the student learning environment.

“I believe that these features will become increasingly relevant as tertiary sector models and policies unfold over the next few years.”

The impact of the TEAC reports on Lincoln is also mentioned by the Vice-Chancellor in the Report and he says it was “disappointing from a Lincoln perspective, to see that the fourth and final TEAC report did not deliver clear funding directions”.

  
Dr Wood concludes his commentary with a reference to Lincoln’s 125 years of tertiary teaching.

“Next year as Lincoln University celebrates its 125th anniversary, we will reflect on the huge contribution that Lincoln has made to the economic and cultural development of New Zealand. Those contributions can only grow as the competitive advantage of industries, technologies and education initiatives based on the environment, biological systems and sustainable business models become more important to New Zealand.”
