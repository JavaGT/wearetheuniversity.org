Fund raising appeal launched at Lincoln

A national and international fund-raising appeal was launched at Lincoln University today (24 Oct.) to restore and preserve the campus heritage buildings Ivey Hall and Memorial Hall.

Described by Chancellor Margaret Austin as “iconic buildings”, Ivey Hall dates from 1878 and Memorial Hall from 1923.

Both are starting to succumb to the ravages of time, she said when launching the appeal at the start of weekend-long celebrations to mark the 125th anniversary of Lincoln University’s founding.

Approximately $2.5 million is needed to refurbish the west and south wings of Ivey Hall and adjacent Memorial Hall.

“Government funds are not available for this work so we must do it ourselves,” she said.

“The aim is to restore the buildings to their original glory and refurbish them to a standard that will provide a high quality venue for future students, staff, alumni and visitors.”

A range of donor benefits are being offered and the appeal is supported by both national and international alumni and friends of the University.
