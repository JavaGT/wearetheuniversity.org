Lincoln University change proposal outcomes

Lincoln University has today announced the results of its review of staffing that supports a return to financial viability and reinforces its role as New Zealand’s specialist, land-based university.

Through a process of engagement with staff the number of compulsory changes has been kept to a minimum. 63 staff have elected to take advantage of an enhanced early retirement package or a voluntary redundancy package. These departures have contributed significantly to securing $3.9million of savings in personnel expenditure, with 89% of this being reached through voluntary means. There will be a net reduction of 48 full time equivalent positions.

The University received over 340 submissions from staff, students and external parties on its proposed changes to staffing. Half of the University’s original proposals were altered (either amended or not confirmed) as a result of these submissions.

“This is not a pleasant process for staff, students or the University itself. The professionalism of the staff and the Tertiary Education Union, and understanding of students, during this period is appreciated by the University. I am pleased that we kept compulsory changes to a minimum. We will now work with affected staff around options for their future,” said Dr Andrew West, Vice-Chancellor.
