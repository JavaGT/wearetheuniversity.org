Lincoln University Professors Win Two Big Awards

**Lincoln University Professors Win Two Big Awards**

Two senior staff of Lincoln University, New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, have won prestigious awards for an area of study the university is not well known for.

Professors Harvey Perkins and Chris Kissling each won a President’s Award from the New Zealand Geographical Society – in spite of the university not having a geography department.

Professor Perkins is a Professor of Human Geography and won his award for graduate research supervision in geography. He has supervised 45 Masters and PhD theses and examined 55. He says his supervision has meant geography has been incorporated into a range of multi-disciplinary research theses focusing on such topics as Maori studies, housing studies, urban studies, parks, recreation, tourism and urban planning.

Professor Kissling’s award for excellence in teaching geography acknowledges his national and international contribution to teaching transport management and logistics. Testimonials from past students tell of an innovative, flexible, passionate and supportive lecturer whose primary interest is in how transport is organised.

Professor Perkins says it’s a coup for Lincoln University to have won two of the six awards made in 2009 when the university doesn’t have a geography department.

“Geography is a discipline which integrates with many others, so we are comfortable blending geographic ideas with those from other areas of study,” he says.

“Students I have worked with have shared my enthusiasm for taking a multi-disciplinary approach to interpreting rural and urban phenomena. It has been hugely stimulating to supervise their work and I am honoured to receive the award.”
