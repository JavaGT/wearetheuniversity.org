Lincoln Alumni Bursaries Provide Incentive For Mid-Year Start

Press release, 28 May, 2007, Lincoln University, New Zealand: Starting a degree or diploma course mid-year opens up a range of opportunities for anyone considering a change of career, re-training or simply starting out on the tertiary education trail.

Undergraduates starting courses at Lincoln University from July 2007 will for the first time be eligible for the newly announced Alumni Bursaries for mid-year entry.

Each bursary is worth up to $2,000 which makes a significant dent in fees for the year, and students from all over New Zealand and overseas are eligible to apply.

Application forms for the Alumni Bursaries are available through the Lincoln website www.lincoln.ac.nz/scholar and must be received by 7 June, 2007. Second semester study begins on 2 July 2007.

Lincoln's Alumni Association manager Sarah Currie says the intention of the mid-year bursaries is to give encouragement to those who may be considering gaining a qualification and don't wish to wait until the new university year in 2008.

"Lincoln has a great selection of courses that are available for mid-year entry in subjects as diverse as software and IT, property valuation, hotel management, environmental management and landscape architecture ," she said.

Emerging from a degree course in the middle of the year can also be a great boost to gaining immediate employment instead of joining the crowd of graduates looking for work at the end of the academic year.
