**New Vice-Chancellor Welcomed To Lincoln University**

Dr Andrew West was officially welcomed as Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University on a beautiful and sunny Canterbury autumn day, in front of Lincoln University’s historic Ivey Hall.

Staff, the senior management team and Council members were joined by representatives from Te Taumutu Rūnanga, the Selwyn Mayor and Chief Executive, CPIT’s Council Chair and members of Dr West’s whānau from Te Arawa, Rotorua, in welcoming Dr West to Lincoln University at a pōwhiri held on Monday 16 April 2012.

Speaking on the behalf of Lincoln University, Chancellor Tom Lambie said it was an honour to welcome Dr West on this “very special occasion”.

“This is a significant day for Lincoln University. Dr West brings with him a wealth of knowledge, experience and networks to lead Lincoln University into the future,” he said.

Dr West comes to the University from a career spanning research, education and commerce, the latter in agriculture, process manufacturing and tourism. Educated in England, Dr West graduated with a BSc in Ecology from the University of Westminster and a PhD from the Council for National Academic Awards prior to emigrating to New Zealand in 1982.

Dr West thanked the University for this opportunity. “It is a privilege to be Vice-Chancellor of this University.

“I commend Lincoln University for remaining true to its identity in being New Zealand’s specialist land-based institution. At the heart of this University are its students, supported by its highly competent and dedicated staff, all encouraged by the significant industries we serve. Moreover, the University has an important role to play in helping restore the vitality of Christchurch and Canterbury, and I very much look forward to making this contribution.”
