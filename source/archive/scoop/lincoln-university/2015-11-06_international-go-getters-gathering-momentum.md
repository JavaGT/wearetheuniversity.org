International go-getters gathering momentum

International go-getters gathering momentum  

  
Twice as many New Zealand Scholarship students are expected to attend Lincoln University in 2016, a gathering of momentum partly attributed to the positive experiences reported by scholars returning to their home countries.

The University’s Postgraduate and International Scholarships Administrator, Sue Bowie, says that in June last year numbers reached a peak of 71 scholars on campus. “We will have farewelled 20 of those by early next year and we have been advised that we will be receiving at least 45 scholars during 2016, so this will take us to close to around 96 New Zealand Scholarship students in total at Lincoln University. This is an increase from 2015 to 2016 of 35.2%. We also had an increase from 2014 to 2015 of 36.5%, so over two years, this equates to an 84.6% increase.

“There are several factors that will be influencing the rise in numbers. Lincoln University’s degrees dovetail in with the priority subject areas listed by MFAT as those that scholars may apply to study and that are going to be of direct developmental relevance to the countries being offered New Zealand Aid. Also, our alumni are returning to their home countries and reporting back about the positive experience they have had at Lincoln University”.

NZ Scholarship and Mingma Norbu Sherpa Memorial Scholarship students expressed their profound gratitude for the opportunities and assistance afforded them by the scholarships and university staff at a ceremony held at the University on Wednesday to honour their academic achievements. Few get the opportunity to attend the University’s official graduation ceremony as they are required to leave New Zealand within 14 days of completing their studies.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor – Academic Quality and Student Experience, Professor Sheelagh Matear warmly congratulated students on their achievements. They were presented with a Certificate of Completion by Matthew Allen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), and University Chancellor Tom Lambie presented each with a pounamu toki. The gift recognises that the students will be forever connected to Lincoln University and the Te Waihora campus.

The students’ resilience was also acknowledged. Sue Bowie says students leave their home country, family and support networks for up to three years to undertake their studies at Lincoln, and that culture shock, homesickness and unfamiliar cold weather are huge challenges for them.

Matthew Allen told students and guests that the Lincoln NZ Scholarship students are part of a community of over 1500 scholars that have graduated through these scholarships and that many of them had overcome significant hurdles to come to New Zealand. He emphasised that the students represent the very best their countries have to offer. The NZ Scholarship programme initiative is managed through MFAT and designed to encourage sustainable development in developing countries, with the ultimate goal being to help reduce poverty and contribute to greater security, equity and prosperity.

Two of the students completing were recipients of the Mingma Norbu Sherpa Memorial Scholarship, set up by the World Wildlife Fund which chose Lincoln University for the living memorial. Professor David Simmonds, a friend of Mingma Norbu Sherpa during his time at Lincoln University, told students and guests, “Tens of thousands of people across the world contribute to support the scholarship students. Extraordinary things can happen when many good people step forward and act together.”
