**Australian Governor-General hosted at Lincoln University**

Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce AC CVO, Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, visited Lincoln University this week and was given an overview of Lincoln University and the collaborations the University has with Australia.

HE Ms Quentin Bryce was accompanied by HE Lt Gen Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae GNZM, QSO Governor-General of New Zealand and HE Mr Paul O’Sullivan, Australian High Commissioner, along with their respective partners.

The visit to Lincoln University, a first for both Governor-Generals, was a chance for the visitors to learn about New Zealand’s land-based specialist university and trans-Tasman alliances.

Along with the Vice-Chancellor, addressing the delegation were Distinguished Professor Alison Stewart, Dr Tim Curran and Professor David Simmons.

“Lincoln University is committed to applied education and research and takes a positive approach to collaborations and partnerships,” says Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field.

“Over the years the University has had a number of collaborations with Australia. These presentations to the Governor-Generals highlight collaborations in the area of sustainable disease management, plant responses to natural disasters and sustainable tourism”.

The Australian Governor-General was “inspired” to hear the work going on at the University, particularly the research being conducted by Dr Tim Curran on how plants respond to natural disasters.

While HE Ms Quentin Bryce was listening to the presentations, her husband, HE Mr Michael Bryce AM AE, who is an architect and graphic and industrial designer, HE Lady Janine Mateparae and Mrs Merrilyn O’Sullivan, were escorted around the University’s School of Landscape Architecture by Head of School Associate Professor Jacky Bowring.
