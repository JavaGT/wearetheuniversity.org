Lincoln & Top Chinese University To Share Research

**Lincoln And Top Chinese University To Share Land-Based Research Expertise**

New forward steps have been taken at Lincoln University contributing to the mutually beneficial relationship emerging between New Zealand and China since the Free Trade Agreement and other recent initiatives.

Closer links between New Zealand and China have the support of both governments and against this background the head of China’s top rank Zhejiang University has visited New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, Lincoln University.

Areas of collaboration for the two universities were explored in talks between the heads of both institutions, Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field and President Professor Yang Wei.

Professor Yang, on his first visit to New Zealand, spent a day at Lincoln University meeting senior staff and seeing at first hand examples of the University’s research work.

The President’s call followed Professor Field’s visit to Zhejiang University in June when a tripartite agreement was signed between Lincoln, Zhejiang, and a university with which Zhejiang has close associations, Guizhou.

Zhejiang University, founded in 1897, is in the top tier of Chinese universities. It is located in the city of Hangzhou in the eastern seaboard province of Zhejiang. Guizhou lies inland in south-western China. During the turbulence of the Second World War, Zhejiang University moved its operation temporarily inland to the Guizhou campus, so there is a strong historical foundation for today’s close relationship between the two institutions.

Scientific contributions by Lincoln University to China’s Great Western Development Programme - the country’s effort to boost its less developed western areas - seem likely.

“Three initial possibilities for collaboration between Zhejiang University and Lincoln University have been identified during my visit,” said Professor Yang.

“Number one is in the area of nitrification inhibitors for use in dairy farming. Guizhou province will soon have one of China’s largest dairy developments and we want to keep it eco-friendly and clean. Lincoln University’s nitrification inhibitor work is very interesting.

Number two is research on the tenderisation of beef and lamb. The work Lincoln University is doing on meat tenderisation using a solution based on kiwifruit juice is also very interesting. Kiwifruit are abundant in Guizhou.

“Thirdly, we can see good opportunities for collaboration in bio-security work, such as dealing with the problem of insect invasions.”

Professor Yang said that other research areas would be added to the list as the relationship between his university and Lincoln University developed.

Professor Roger Field said that the research collaboration would focus on issues of importance to both countries and the identified areas were particularly well suited to the land- based research strengths of Lincoln University.
