**Lincoln’s star continues to rise in world rankings**

The just released 2014-2015 Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings has seen Lincoln University jump some 70 places to now sit in the 411-420 bracket. Lincoln is one of only two New Zealand universities to experience a rise in the world rankings this year.

Lincoln University’s small size coupled with its specialist nature has traditionally meant the University has struggled to enter the ranking system on account of the methodology employed by QS, and was recognised in the top 500 for the first time in 2013. The University’s new ranking, considerably up on the 2013 result, is a significant achievement and testament to the quality and relevance of the University’s research outputs.

By some estimates, there are more than 10,000 universities around the world, with just 3,000 eligible for ranking under the QS system. Lincoln is now recognised as sitting in the top five percent of world universities and the top 14 percent of those ranked.

“Naturally we’re very pleased with Lincoln’s significant increase in the world rankings,” says Lincoln University Acting Vice-Chancellor, Sheelagh Matear.

“The big win for the University has been in the _Academic Reputation_ category, which is perhaps recognition of recent initiatives such as our qualifications reform and our work in positioning Lincoln as New Zealand’s specialist land-based university; not to mention recent successes such as our inclusion into the exclusive Euroleague of Life Sciences network.

“All this has translated into an increase in the _International Students_ category as well; which reflects growing global awareness of Lincoln University as an attractive, reputable and highly relevant academic destination,” she says.
