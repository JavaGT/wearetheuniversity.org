**DOC appoints Lincoln Professor as Chief Science Advisor**

Lincoln University Professor of Environmental Management Ken Hughey has been appointed to the newly created position of Chief Science Advisor with the Department of Conservation (DOC).

The new role, commencing in December, will involve Professor Hughey working three days per week for DOC, and for a two year term.

Core responsibilities of the position include providing DOC Director-General, Lou Sanson, with frank advice on policy matters relating to evidence-based science, strengthening networks with other science advisors across the public sector, and taking a lead role in DOC’s contribution to the National Science Challenges and natural resources management in general.

Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, congratulated Professor Hughey on the new role and welcomed the appointment as a signal of the strong relationship between the University and land-based public sector organisations, including DOC.

Professor Hughey has been previously employed by DOC through a variety of management and research roles.

His academic background is well aligned to DOC’s needs, and includes such research as: the economics of endangered species management; big game animal policy; water resources management; public perceptions of the state of New Zealand’s environment; tourism and climate change adaptation; and tourism and disaster risk reduction.

He is currently an active member of the Hurunui Waiau Water Zone Management Committee, the Waihora Ellesmere Trust (where he chairs the organising committee of the biennial living lake symposia), and the newly established Te Tihi o Rauhea Hanmer Springs Conservation Trust.

“I’m very grateful to DOC for this opportunity to work on enhancing conservation policy in New Zealand through robust science-based research,” says Professor Hughey. “New Zealand has some unique challenges in this space, but also some tremendous opportunities. I’m very much looking forward to contributing toward ensuring New Zealand remains a world leader in conservation, and demonstrating the value of conservation for a prosperous future.”
