Major new dryland farming research project

Lincoln University launches major new dryland farming research project

Lincoln University research that will "push the boundaries" of productivity  
and profitability in dryland farming will be launched with a public field day at  
Silverwood Farm, Hororata, on Wednesday 24 October.

The research, funded by the MAF´s Sustainable Farming Fund with support  
from Ravensdown Ltd and Agriseeds Ltd, is responding to a recent survey in  
which sheep farmers identified improvement in flock productivity and  
profitability as their greatest need.

Lincoln University agricultural scientists and farm management experts  
believe it is possible to increase flock productivity on dryland sheep farms  
through a combination of -  
o More efficient ewes, producing more kilograms per weaned lamb  
against kilograms of mated ewe;  
o Increased animal and flock performance through improved pasture  
quality and feeding value;  
o Greater flexibility in farm policies to deal with climate variability.

Two trial units of 87 and 85 hectares, each of 16 paddocks, have been  
established at Silverwood and stocked with small framed, high fecundity  
ewes at high stocking rates. One unit is based on high intake/high quality  
pasture species including lucerne, perennial clovers oversown with annual  
grasses - the \`switch system - winter forage and permanent pastures; the  
other unit is based on intensively managed perennial grass:clover pasture  
with one paddock of winter forage and one paddock of lucerne.

Silverwood is a 418-hectare light land farm at Hororata. It is operated under  
a charitable trust and has been leased by Lincoln University since 1999.

Lincoln University established a farmer reference group to help define  
research priorities for the farm and the dryland sheep system project is the  
first big enterprise.

"Farmers in the Silverwood reference group made it clear they wanted to  
see research that would \`push the boundaries´ of productivity and profitability  
in dryland farming," says the project leader Professor Tony Bywater.

"In discussion with Lincoln University staff the farmers identified ewe  
efficiency (that is, kilogram per lamb weaned against kilogram per ewe  
mated); management of high fecundity ewes; maximising lamb numbers;  
alternative lambing times; and feeder lambs versus finishing lambs, as high  
priorities for investigation on the animal side.

"On the pasture side, areas regarded as important for research were feed  
quality and pasture mixes to achieve high performance levels; annual  
grasses plus nitrogen versus annual legumes versus perennial clovers;  
winter feeding options; and maintaining high clover pastures.

"Other issues the reference group was keen to see investigated included  
risk management options with respect to climate and markets; integration  
with irrigated farms; ICT applications in monitoring and decision-making  
support; and independent comparisons of competing husbandries and  
technologies.

"Above all, farmers wanted detailed monitoring to provide a strong  
benchmark on productivity and profit."

There are around 3560 dryland farms on the east coast of New Zealand,  
covering some 1.64 million hectares and carrying 12.2 million stock units.

"The main constraint to increased productivity on these farms is the risk  
inherent in the highly variable growing environment of a dryland farm," says  
Professor Bywater.

"Most farmers adopt a conservative policy, keeping costs down and  
maintaining a relatively low stocking rate to reduce the risk of running out of  
feed.

"In the Silverwood trials we will be looking at greater flexibility in farm  
policies to deal with climate variability. We will stock for better than average  
seasons and build in as many flexibilities as possible to reduce feed demand  
when pasture production is less than expected."

The field day at Silverwood Farm on Wednesday 24 October starts at  
1.30pm. Silverwood is on Leeches Road, 5.75 km west of the Selwyn  
sawmill on the road from Hororata to Windwhistle. All interested farmers,  
industry representatives and members of the public are welcome. No prior  
registration is necessary.
