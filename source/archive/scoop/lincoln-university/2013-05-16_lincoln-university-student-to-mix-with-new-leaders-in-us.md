Lincoln University Student to Mix with ‘New Leaders’ In US
==========================================================

**Lincoln University Student to Mix with ‘New Leaders’ In Washington D.C.**

Lincoln University Future Leaders Scholarship student, Brigitte Ravera, has been awarded a prestigious place at the 2013 United States – New Zealand Pacific Partnership Forum to be held in Washington D.C. from 19 to 21 May.

The award is part of the Future Partners Programme, which aims to facilitate active dialogue between a diverse group of emerging American and New Zealand leaders in the interest of exposing participants to differing viewpoints, stimulating ‘new thinking’, and assisting in developing leaders with an interest in global issues and the US-NZ relationship.

With the panel of judges comprising of representatives from Fulbright New Zealand, the New Zealand United States Council, the Embassy of the United States, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the selection process required a written piece from the applicant outlining why they believed they would be a good ambassador for New Zealand and what specific attributes they could bring to the forum.

Only 20 places were available to New Zealand applicants, with up to 10 places reserved for current or former Fulbright scholarship recipients.

Of the successful applicants, most are either postgraduate students studying Master’s or PhD degrees, or currently working. With Brigitte still in her third year of a Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree at Lincoln University, and having just turned 20 years of age, this makes her achievement all the more remarkable.

“I’m hoping to learn a lot from this experience,” says Brigitte. “There is going to be a specific component on agriculture, particularly with respect to food security and trade. So, I’m really looking forward to hearing what the key players of today think about where we stand currently and what will happen in the future.”

Although Brigitte sees this as a “huge opportunity” and is looking forward to meeting and discussing her ideas with other forum members, she is looking forward to the travel aspect of the trip as well.

“We’re flying to Washington DC on an RNZAF flight. It’s going to be very exciting!”
