Canterbury Ecologist Honoured

**Canterbury Ecologist Honoured**

Canterbury ecologist Dr Colin Burrows has today been named by the Minister of Conservation as this year’s recipient of the prestigious Loder Cup.

Dr Burrows has been recognised for his significant dedication to Canterbury’s natural history, botany and plant ecology.

Mike Bowie, Lincoln University’s Senior Technical Officer in Ecology, nominated Dr Burrows for the award and says he is delighted to see Dr Burrows honoured.

“The Loder Cup was established to honour New Zealanders who investigate, promote, retain and cherish our indigenous flora,” he says. “Colin certainly meets every one of those criteria through his significant lifetime accomplishments, including as a trust advisor of the Quail Island Ecological Restoration Trust.

“During my 12 years on the trust with Colin, I have been inspired by his wealth of botanical knowledge. His goal since the inception of the trust has been to restore Quail Island to its indigenous flora and fauna, so Cantabrians can enjoy the island’s native splendour.”

Mike Bowie says Dr Burrows’ academic career is also full of major accomplishments in New Zealand botany and plant ecology.

“Even at 79 years of age, his publications keep rolling off the press and for many of us the 2008 publication of _The Natural History of Canterbury_ which he co-edited is considered a ‘bible’ for the native biodiversity of the region.

“There is no doubt Dr Colin Burrows has made a huge contribution towards the knowledge and conservation of New Zealand’s flora in many varied ways. He is definitely a worthy recipient of the Loder Cup - in fact, as I wrote my nomination submission, I spoke to two esteemed plant ecologists who were amazed he hadn’t received it years ago.”

Dr Burrows will receive the Loder Cup at a presentation ceremony later this year on a date yet to be decided.
