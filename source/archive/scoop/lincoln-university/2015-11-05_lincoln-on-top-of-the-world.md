Lincoln on top of the world

**Lincoln on top of the world**

Lincoln University has number one world ratings in the newly released International Student Barometer survey.

The survey, in which over 200 universities world-wide and all New Zealand universities participated, rates student satisfaction levels: Lincoln was number one worldwide in helping students choose topics, in how it runs its accommodation and finance offices, and in administrative tasks such as helping students obtain health insurance.

Lincoln University’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, International and Business Development, Jeremy Baker, says the results show Lincoln has a strong international programme which it regards as an integral part of the University.

It reflects on many aspects, from student administration to teaching, and shows the whole student experience is important.

Lincoln also rated first in numerous categories among the New Zealand Universities, such as the quality of its teachers, managing research, learning support, assessment and performance feedback, and employability (or how much a qualification will enhance a student’s career prospects).

It is also considered the safest campus in New Zealand.

The result is no surprise for Izzie Guo, who has just submitted her final paper for a one-year Lincoln University Master’s course in Tourism Management, has been in New Zealand for six years, and has studied at several institutions since leaving China.

She is one of 846 international students at Lincoln so far in 2015, making up nearly 21 per cent of the student population.

Izzie backs up the results— she says the teaching at Lincoln was much more enjoyable than she had experienced before.

“We are more like friends”, she says of the lecturers.

“In a class discussion we are all equals, and the smaller classes mean a better learning environment. It’s a caring community.”

She was particularly persuaded by a quick email response from her student advisor when she wanted to know about her course, and if she could get in.

“She replied in 10 minutes, and getting visas and other paperwork was easy- all things which made a difference.”

Her Dad had previously been on a business trip to New Zealand which included a stopover at Lincoln, and left him impressed. He told his young daughter about it.

“As such I have always known about Lincoln,” she says, and was further drawn by the quality of research carried out at the University.

Notably the survey shows the number of students who would recommend Lincoln was also on the rise, and there is a high overall satisfaction rating.

This is something which Izzie also endorses.

“Where I am happy I will learn the most. I would definitely recommend it.”
