Future Leaders scholars about to ‘shave to save’

Lincoln University Future Leaders scholars about to ‘shave to save’

On Sunday 20 May, Lincoln University Future Leaders scholars will be busy raising funds for Leukaemia and Blood Cancer New Zealand, with a little help from Richie McCaw, Ali Williams, Michael Hobbs and many more other New Zealand professional rugby players.

In 2011 the Future Leaders scholars from Lincoln University set up a scheme called ‘Lend a Hand’ which helps raise funds for charities and organisations in need. Last year over $18,000 was fundraised for two organisations affected by the Christchurch earthquakes. Every year a new charity will be focused on.

This year the Future Leaders scholars have chosen Leukaemia and Blood Cancer New Zealand as this year’s worthy recipient. Every day, six New Zealanders are diagnosed with a blood cancer and it can strike anyone, of any age, at any time, without warning.

From 12.00pm to 2.00pm on Sunday 20 May at Lincoln University, Richie McCaw, Ali Williams and Michael Hobbs will be on campus helping the Future Leaders scholars to raise as much money as possible for this worthy cause. During the two hours there will be plenty of games, activities and prizes, as well as some serious head shaving going on

Anna Luhrs who manages the Future Leaders scholarship programme says “the future leader scholarship programme assists students of high academic calibre to realise their leadership potential while undertaking tertiary study.

“As part of the programme the future leaders participate in projects which will inspire and challenge them with a goal of helping the local and wider community, which is how ‘Lend a Hand’ was initiated. The reason behind choosing this Foundation to support in 2012 is because one of the Future Leaders scholars, Isabelle Hobbs, has been directly affected by the disease, with the passing of her father Jock Hobbs.

“We want as many people as possible to come to Lincoln University on Sunday 20 May to support and donate to a great cause.”
