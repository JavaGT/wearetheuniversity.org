Push to make cycling a way of life

Push to make cycling a way of life

A group of transport and health experts are teaming up with a Lincoln University academic to encourage a stronger cycling culture in Canterbury.

The first meeting of the Active Living Research Canterbury Working Group was held at the Selwyn District Council recently.

The group, established by health and exercise lecturer Dr Catherine Elliot, includes transport professionals from the Christchurch City and Selwyn District councils and health experts from the Canterbury District Health Board and Ara Institute of Canterbury.

“We aim to have four meetings a year. The group brings together a wide range of experts to discuss how best to encourage active transport in the community,” says Dr Elliot.

“Convincing more people to cycle can be difficult, partly because our transport networks are designed to prioritise cars ahead of other modes of transportation.”

Dr Elliot says the current transport system has unintentionally neglected those who are unable to drive, such as the disabled, the elderly, and people who can’t afford a car.

“As well as this, it has decreased the perceived safety of cycling. For those earning middle-class incomes and above, cars are the only real option in the eyes of the majority.”

It is also tough to change people’s behaviour when the human brain is hard-wired to operate on autopilot, which reinforces our habits, Dr Elliot says.

“The habit of driving to work tends to override our greatest intentions to try other modes of transport, such as biking.”

At the first group meeting, Dr Elliot spoke about the psychology of habit change.

“One useful technique is a nudge, which changes policies and the environment in order to alter people’s behaviour,” she says. “For example, putting fruit at eye level at the supermarket checkout counts as a nudge.

“The meetings are aimed at working out how to position cycling at ‘eye level’ for Cantabrians.”

One of Dr Elliot’s ‘nudge’ strategies is a Park & Go programme, with bike racks set up in certain locations, allowing people to drive for part of their journey and cycle for the remainder of the trip.

“We’re not asking people to bike every day, but even just trying it twice a week, they would likely feel the impacts on their health.”

She is also undertaking a case study whereby a Lincoln University staff member who normally drives to work will take part in a Park & Go programme, driving as far as Prebbleton and cycling the rest of the way to Lincoln.

Her physiology will be measured over a period of three months in order to track the positive changes that occur during the study.

“Finding out how beneficial a cycling routine is can really motivate people to continue.”

Dr Elliot is also seeking support to develop an Active Living Research Laboratory at Lincoln University, which will act as a service for community members, measuring their blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol and fitness levels.

“These are the necessary vital signs for evaluating one’s risk of heart disease and diabetes. Cycling will certainly lower disease risk, increase fitness and likely help those who struggle with weight loss.

“We also want to create a mobile lab, where we enter workplaces and collect measurements on-site. The data will be used to build a health and fitness registry for the Canterbury region.”

These activities come after Dr Elliot initiated New Zealand’s first rural-based bike share scheme at Lincoln University. Since late last year, three bicycles have been stationed outside the campus library and can be hired at any time by staff, students and community members.

The programme is run via an app known as Nextbike, a version of which is used for similar schemes throughout Europe and at bike share locations in Auckland, Cambridge and Christchurch.

“Access to the bikes might encourage residents in rural areas to prioritise active living. This is particularly important for short trips to town that actually take longer after considering walking to the car and finding parking.”
