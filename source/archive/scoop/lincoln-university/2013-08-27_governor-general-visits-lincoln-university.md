**Governor-General visits Lincoln University**

The Governor-General, Lt Gen The Rt Hon Sir Jerry Mateparae, visited Lincoln University and the Lincoln University Dairy Research Farm on Friday 23 August 2013.

In his second visit to the University, the Governor-General was taken on a tour of the Lincoln University Dairy Research Farm (LURDF) and heard from key Lincoln University staff regarding the latest agriculture and science research, such as precision agriculture and nitrate research, as well as the social and landscape dynamics of land-based production.

“It was an honour to host Sir Jerry Mateparae at the Lincoln University Dairy Research Farm,” says Lincoln University Chancellor and Environment Canterbury Commissioner Tom Lambie.

“The LURDF was established in 2009 with the primary aim of research on profitable and sustainable dairy production, particularly for South Island farms. The Governor-General heard and saw first-hand just some of the research Lincoln University is currently conducting on soils, forages and cows to support dairy production systems.”

The visit was organised in conjunction with Environment Canterbury, with Chair, Dame Margaret Bazley and Deputy Chair, Hon David Caygill informing the Governor-General of the work being carried out by Environment Canterbury around water and irrigation.

Eighty-five percent of water allocated in Canterbury is for irrigation. The Canterbury region has enough water to meet water demands, including the needs of the environment, however the water is not always in the right place at the right time.

After the visit to the Lincoln University Dairy Research Farm, the Governor-General returned to the University’s campus and took the opportunity to discuss further the University’s teaching and research with staff.
