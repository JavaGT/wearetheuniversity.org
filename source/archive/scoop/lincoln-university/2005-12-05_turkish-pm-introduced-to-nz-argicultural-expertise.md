Lincoln University introduces visiting PM to New Zealand agricultural expertise

The visiting Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who arrived in New Zealand on Sunday, has his first taste of the land tomorrow afternoon (6 Dec.) during a two and a quarter hour visit to Lincoln University.

Accompanied by four Ministers and a large party of Turkish business representatives, Mr Erdogan will attend campus presentations about Lincoln University’s research and teaching capabilities in biotechnology, farm management systems and animal husbandry. He will then travel to the University’s pastoral systems research farm, Ashley Dene, to see sheep and pasture research in action.

The Lincoln visit is the only university engagement on the Prime Minister’s four-day New Zealand visit.

The Prime Minister is a former Mayor of Istanbul and is recognised as the driving force behind economic reform in both Istanbul and Turkey. He has a genuine interest in agriculture as a vehicle for economic growth.

He departs for Australia on Wednesday morning.

  
(Pronounciation guide: phonetic pronounciation of the Prime Minister’s name is - ‘Rarejep Tieyep Urdoarn’)
