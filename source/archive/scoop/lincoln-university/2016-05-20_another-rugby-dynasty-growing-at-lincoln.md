Another rugby dynasty growing at Lincoln

Members of another high-achieving family rugby dynasty are following in the wake of alumni All Black siblings Sam and George Whitelock at Lincoln University.

Taranaki-raised Scott and Jordie Barrett, younger brothers of All Black Beauden and Auckland Blues player Kane, are Lincoln sports scholars, and both are making their mark on the pitch.

Dad, Kevin "Smiley" Barrett, also played 167 matches for Taranaki and 14 for the Hurricanes.

Scott, 22, studying for a Bachelor of Agriculture degree, is impressing in Super Rugby for the Crusaders, and has just extended his contract with them for another two years. He has played for the side for two-and-a-half seasons after standout NPC performances but had an injury curtailed 2015.

Bachelor of Commerce student Jordie, 19, has just come back from the U20 Oceania Cup tournament in Australia and has been named in the national squad for the U20 World Cup in Manchester starting in June.

Jordie has already played for the Crusader Knights, the franchise’s development side, and for Canterbury U19s.

Both have to juggle studies with rugby commitments — Jordie will be sitting exams while he is in the UK. Scott has been through that before, being a former member of the U20s himself.

Of course they have aspirations to wear the senior sized black jersey, and have a few insights through Beauden as to what it’s like to be an All Black.

The brothers try to make the trip back to Taranaki, to their family dairy farm at Pungarehu, as often as possible, Jordie says.

We all get together at Christmas, Scott adds, and although big brother has dropped a few hints to move to the Hurricanes, both are happy where they are.

It may not be too many Christmases however until the name Barrett becomes as common as Whitelock in the top echelons of the game, and there is no fight over the wishbone anymore.
