**Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit marks 50 years of research leadership**

  
The Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit (AERU) at Lincoln University will celebrate 50 years of research leadership in October, hosting an event with past and current staff, government officials and key stakeholders.

Originally named the Agricultural Economics Research Unit, the AERU was founded in 1962 under Professor Bryan Philpott and was originally created as a research division within the Commerce programme at Lincoln College (as it was known back then).

“Fifty years on, the AERU operates as a semi-autonomous research centre at Lincoln University providing research expertise to a wide-range of regional, national and international organisations in the public and private sectors” says AERU Director, Professor Caroline Saunders.

The catalogue of AERU research publications over the last 50 years shows that the AERU has always been involved in the analysis of current issues of importance to New Zealand. While its research focus has shifted over time in response to the changing external environment, the AERU is still fulfilling the role for which it was established.

“The AERU was established to be a centre of research excellence providing and supporting expertise to promote New Zealand’s economic well-being” says Professor Saunders. “We specialise in four key areas of trade and environment; economic development; non-market valuation; and social research. However, a common theme that unites our recent research programmes is sustainable well-being.”

From 1962 to 1970 many research efforts focused on the need to increase primary production in New Zealand in order to achieve a higher quality of life. Between 1971 and 1975, farm management and the effective use of rural resources were the subjects of many of the reports published. Between 1976 and 1985, an increase in market research reports was commissioned by industry entities to help determine market demand and projections.

During the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, the AERU was at the forefront of research to help land-based producers adjust to the new economic environment after the economic reforms initiated by Roger Douglas. Throughout the 1990’s, the traditional AERU research agenda was extended in response to the changing environment, to address issues such as producer and public perceptions of food production technologies, and developing concerns in agriculture such as pesticide use.

In recent years, the AERU has investigated a diverse range of issues that affect quality of life and economic performance in New Zealand. Recent research is using innovative market research techniques to explore the desirability of particular attributes of New Zealand products in various overseas markets. Publications have focused on subjects as diverse as the economics of well-being; agricultural sustainability and climate change; factors affecting employment; and many other areas of economics and sociology.

The AERU also places strong emphasis on mentoring emerging researchers and providing advanced education to postgraduate students. Currently, the AERU employs 15 staff and two postgraduate students, with a focus on exercising strong research leadership to provide a high quality research experience and to facilitate career progression.
