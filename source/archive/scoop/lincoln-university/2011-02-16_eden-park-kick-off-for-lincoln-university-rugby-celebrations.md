### Eden Park kick-off for Lincoln University rugby celebrations

Lincoln University launches eight months of celebrations marking 130 years of contribution to New Zealand rugby with a high profile function at Eden Park, Auckland, tonight. (16 February)

The University, which fielded its first rugby team in 1881, the season immediately after its doors opened in 1880, lists over 30 All Blacks among its former students, including four All Black captains, two New Zealand Maori captains, and innumerable provincial, South Island, New Zealand Universities and other representatives.

Two of the four All Black captains - Wilson Whineray and Andy Dalton - will be at tonight’s gathering, which brings together over 100 guests from the Auckland area associated with Lincoln University rugby. Former Commonwealth Secretary-General and Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir Don McKinnon, himself a Lincoln University alumnus, is also on the guest list.

Wilson Whineray - now Sir Wilson - captained the Lincoln University 1st XV during his student days and Andy Dalton, captained the 2nd XV in his time. (The other two captains with Lincoln University links are Reuben Thorne and Richie McCaw.)

The gathering starts with a tour of Eden Park and the official welcome by Lincoln University’s Chancellor, Tom Lambie, is at 6.30pm.

Guest speakers include TVNZ sports reporter Toni Street, who is a Lincoln University graduate and former Sports Scholar at the University.

During the evening a dvd of the history of Lincoln University rugby will be shown, which includes interviews with many rugby celebrities.

The function has been organised by Lincoln University’s Alumni Office and is the first of over a dozen gatherings being held throughout the length of New Zealand between now and October to mark 130 years of Lincoln University rugby.

“What better time to celebrate Lincoln University’s huge contribution to our national sport than the year of the World Rugby Cup,” says Alumni Manager Sarah Currie.
