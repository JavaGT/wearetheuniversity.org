More scholarships offered to attract Māori and Pasifika
=======================================================

**Press Release: [Lincoln University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University)**

Lincoln University is continuing its drive to increase Māori and Pasifika representation in tertiary study, by introducing a suite of scholarships in 2019.

The $5000 scholarships are intended to assist those passionate about agriculture, science, tourism, Mātauraka Māori including Mahinga kai, and to support students pathwaying up from other tertiary providers.

Lincoln introduced Māori and Pasifika Accommodation Scholarships at the start of 2018, while Sir Turi Carroll Scholarships for Māori student leaders were initiated in 2013.

Lincoln University Director Maori and Pasifika, Dr Dione Payne, said the intent of the scholarships is to support and encourage Māori and Pasifika students to achieve their aspirations for their whenua, whānau, hapū and iwi.

They are part of an overall strategy to increase the number of Māori and Pasifika students at Lincoln University, which includes pastoral and cultural support to create a home-like atmosphere on campus for those away from whānau.

The scholarships are a key component of Lincoln University’s Whenua Strategy (for Māori) and Motu Strategy (for Pasifika), she said.

_The new scholarships are :_

**_Aoraki Connect Scholarship_**\- for Māori tertiary students pathwaying up from other educational providers  
**_Mātauraka Māori Scholarship_**\- for Māori students who demonstrate excellence in subjects focused on Te Ao Māori  
**_Ahuwhenua Scholarship_**\- for Māori students who enrol in an agricultural focused qualification  
**_Putaiao Scholarship_**\- Māori students who demonstrate an interest and excellence in science related subjects  
**_Tāpoi Scholarship_**\- for Māori students that demonstrate an interest and excellence in tourism related subjects  
**_Fanua Scholarship_** - for domestic Pasifika students from any high school that demonstrate excellence in any subject that relates to Lincoln University subject areas.
