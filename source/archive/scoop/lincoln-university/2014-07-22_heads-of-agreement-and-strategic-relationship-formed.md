Heads of Agreement and Strategic Relationship formed between Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Apa and Lincoln University  

Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Apa and Lincoln University today announced the signing of a Heads of Agreement and Strategic Relationship. This relationship agreement forms the basis for partnerships across education, training, research and commercial development. The Ngā Wairiki-Ngāti Apa people of Whangaehu, Rangitīkei and Turakina own the Rūnanga, and have interests in seeing their people developed in all levels of the primary industries. The Rūnanga is also keen to see the general Māori population in the region given better access to primary sector training and tertiary education.

Rūnanga Chairman Pahia Turia said that “Through our Treaty settlements we have land, and we have recently established Te Hou Farms Limited Partnership which purchased the historic Flock House farms near Bulls, early in June. We are therefore committed investors in the primary sector, and we have a real interest in seeing our own people developed and working at all levels in the primary sector on and around our investments.”

“Ngā Wairiki-Ngāti Apa Iwi and hapū have extensive land-holdings from which they can derive significant wealth whilst simultaneously conserving the environment. Education and training along with research and development are essential to achieving these twin aspirations. As Aotearoa’s only specialist University with a 100% focus on land-based enterprise and conservation, Lincoln University will work in partnership to help provide the confidence, skills, knowledge and technologies vital to the peoples of Ngā Wairiki-Ngāti Apa as a cornerstone to their realising their inspirational, one hundred-year strategy. It is just a privilege to work as a partner,” says Dr Andrew West, Lincoln University.

The initial agreement is for a period of 10 years with renewals anticipated.
