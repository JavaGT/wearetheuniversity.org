Budget funding boost welcomed

  
A 20 per cent increase in tertiary funding for agriculture announced in today’s budget is being welcomed by Lincoln University Deputy Vice-Chancellor International and Business Development Jeremy Baker.

The increase is part of an $85.8 million boost over four years for targeted increases in tuition rates at degree level and above, which also includes a 7.5 per cent increase for science.

Mr Baker described the announcement as recognition of the vital role agriculture plays in the New Zealand economy, and for institutions like Lincoln University, with its specific land-based focus, in providing world-class graduates to meet the growing demand in the sector for highly-trained workers.

It shows the area is a priority for the Government and for New Zealand, he says, as it needs to be.

He also praises the extra funding for science as it is complementary with agricultural studies in many of the programmes being offered at the University.

“The extra funding will allow for extra investment in the scientific intensity of the programmes, and will help attract students to agriculture, a subject area which is already experiencing significant growth,” he says.
