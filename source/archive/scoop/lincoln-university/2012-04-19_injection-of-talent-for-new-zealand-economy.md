NEWS FROM LINCOLN UNIVERSITY

Injection of talent for New Zealand economy

New Zealand’s land-based economy gets its annual boost of new blood on Friday (20 April) when Lincoln University produces its latest batch of graduates.

Five hundred and fifty-three (553) new degree, diploma and certificate recipients will be awarded their qualifications at the University’s 2012 graduation ceremony, held over two sessions - morning and afternoon - in the Lincoln Event Centre, Lincoln township, Canterbury.

The total number is 15 up on last year. The number receiving doctorates, 35, is 12 more than last year.

The ceremony is the first under newly appointed Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West, who started at the University on Monday. (16 April)

The capping ceremony sees Lincoln living up to its name as New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, as over half the qualifications being awarded are in agriculture, horticulture, viticulture and wine science, agricultural science, agricultural commerce, farm management, horticultural management, valuation and property management, landscape architecture, environmental management and resources management.

At the morning ceremony, starting at 10.00am, an honorary Doctor of Commerce will be awarded to prominent New Zealand agribusiness leader Sir Graeme Harrison of Christchurch, founder of ANZCO Foods, one of the country’s largest suppliers of meat to international markets. This award reflects Sir Graeme’s contribution to agribusiness in New Zealand, an area of importance in Lincoln University’s teaching portfolio.

In the afternoon ceremony, which starts at 2.00pm, an honorary Doctor of Natural Resources degree will be conferred on All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, reflecting his national and international rugby achievements and the University’s close association with sport through its pioneering Sports Scholarship programme; and an honorary Doctor of Science degree will be awarded to Dr Jan Wright, Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, reflecting her service and achievements in environmental stewardship, another area of prominence in Lincoln University’s teaching and research.

Also in the afternoon session, the University’s Bledisloe Medal, instituted in 1930 for services advancing New Zealand’s interests, will be awarded to endocrinologist Dr Margaret Evans of Canterbury, whose pioneering research in equine reproduction contributed outstandingly to the equine industry in New Zealand and internationally.

In the morning session the University’s Alumni International Medal for distinguished achievements and contributions by an alumnus outside New Zealand, will be presented to Kiwi-born John Clendon of Thailand, Managing Director of Univanich Palm Oil Company, a world leader in the sustainable production of palm oil.

All Black’s captain Richie McCaw is not the only world champion rugby player taking part in this year’s Lincoln University ceremony. Just a few minutes before he receives his award at the end of the afternoon session, Black Ferns halfback Kendra Cocksedge, originally from Taranaki and a member of New Zealand’s world champion women’s rugby team since 2007, will receive her Bachelor of Recreation Management (Sport) degree.
