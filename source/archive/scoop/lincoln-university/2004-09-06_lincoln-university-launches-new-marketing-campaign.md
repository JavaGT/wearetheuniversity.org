Lincoln University Launches New Marketing Campaign

A new marketing campaign has been launched by Lincoln University to increase awareness of the evolution of the University as a place of real learning and real thinking that is relevant to the real world.

Lincoln University boasts a roll of more than 4500 students with student numbers increasing by 8% on 2003.

The campaign was launched on Sunday \[29 August 2004\] and includes cinema, bus backs and shelters, magazine and newspaper advertising around New Zealand. The graphics are simple and hard hitting, use hard facts and figures and celebrate the uniqueness of Lincoln University and its evolution as a leading tertiary institution. \[See attached images\]

“Lincoln University has evolved over time, student numbers continue to increase and we want to make sure that prospective students, their families and communities have a real picture of our institution as it is today,” says Vice Chancellor Professor Roger Field.

“There are still those that see Lincoln University as just an agriculture college. We are proud of our history but times have certainly changed. Lincoln University now has over 100 undergraduate and postgraduate courses ranging from Commerce to Environmental Management. Lincoln University has a focus on applied learning and solving real world problems. The University works in partnership with industry to ensure course content is real and relevant to the working world. We want our students to leave Lincoln University with qualifications that mean they are sought after by employers internationally.”

Professor Field says the University has undertaken extensive research to underpin the campaign.

Some of the interesting facts that feature in the campaign include:

WE ARE JUDGED ON YOUR SUCCESS. WE MAKE DAMNED SURE YOU SUCCEED. In 2003, 89% of Lincoln University graduates got jobs within six months of completing their qualification. WHERE HAVE ALL THE GRADUATES GONE? In 2003, 95% of final year Agricultural Science students were offered employment before finishing their degrees. NO APPOINTMENT NECESSARY. A SIMPLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR WILL DO. At Lincoln University there is one full-time academic staff member for every 15 full-time students. MORE DAVID THAN GOLIATH. In a selection process involving New Zealand’s major research institutions, Lincoln University was the only South Island institution selected to host one of seven Centres of Research Excellence. CHICKS. DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU LINCOLN IS FOR BOYS. 44% of students are female.

And some interesting people also feature:

THINK. SOMEDAY YOU’LL BE PAID TO. B.Com.Ag graduate (1990) Geoff Ross is CEO and the brains behind 42 Below – New Zealand’s first locally produced premium vodka. Since the first bottle sold in 1999, 42 Below has stormed its way onto the top shelves of bars around the world. IF AGRICULTURE IS THE BACKBONE OF NEW ZEALAND, WHO IS THE BACKBONE OF AGRICULTURE? Emeritus Lincoln Professor Ian Coop was instrumental in breeding the Coopworth – New Zealand’s second most numerous sheep.

“Students who come to Lincoln University want freedom and independence to grow as individuals but also in terms of learning, thinking and challenging themselves. This marketing campaign takes our target audiences on a journey to visit and see Lincoln University as it is now,” concluded Professor Roger Field.
