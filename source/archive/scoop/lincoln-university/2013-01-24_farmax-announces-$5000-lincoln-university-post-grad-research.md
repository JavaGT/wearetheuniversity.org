**Farmax Announces $5000 Lincoln University Post-Grad Research Scholarship  
**

Hamilton, New Zealand – Pastoral management software company, Farmax, announced today that it will provide one Lincoln University post-graduate researcher a $5000 scholarship in 2013.

The scholarship is open to all people eligible to perform postgraduate research at Lincoln University in Canterbury whose research project will utilise Farmax software products.

Farmax General Manager, Gavin McEwen, says the scholarship will be awarded to, “someone performing agricultural research that can make use of Farmax’s decision support and modelling tools. Farmax allows for planning, monitoring and performance reporting about farm systems - in particular pasture management and animal intake.

“The selection committee will award the scholarship to a student whose research has potential to ultimately benefit New Zealand farmers, as this objective aligns with our core company values.”

The scholarship application period is now open and closes on 31 March. The scholarship covers a period of 12 months and will start in Term 2. It is open to both current students and those intending to apply to study at the University.

Mr McEwen says the company’s backbone is based on decades of research and it wants to encourage the country’s next generation of agricultural scientists and rural professionals.

“The formation of Farmax as a commercial company in 2002 was the culmination of over a decade of research performed by AgResearch scientists who developed one of the world’s leading decision support systems and software for the pastoral industry.

“Our staff, farming clients, ag consultants and even industry good entities have all witnessed first-hand how great research can translate into huge benefits for farmers. That’s why we’re committed to investing in the next generation of agricultural scientists,” he explains.

**About Farmax**

The science and technology behind Farmax was originally developed by some of the world’s leading pastoral scientists at AgResearch. In 2002, the technology proved its commercial viability; it was spun out of the CRI and the company, Farmax Ltd, was formed. AgResearch retains 50% ownership of Farmax, which is now a joint venture between the research institute, industry consultants and one of NZ’s largest family owned farming operations.

Farmax is a software tool used in both the sheep/beef and dairy industries. The system gives farmers and their rural professionals the information they need to effectively convert pasture into higher profits. The system allows for planning, monitoring and performance reporting.
