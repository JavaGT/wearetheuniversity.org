**Lincoln University Student Places In Top Five In International Design Competition**

A student from Lincoln University’s School of Landscape Architecture has placed in the top five in a prestigious international design competition.

Ksenia (Kess) Aleksandrova, who has just completed her Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (Hons) degree, achieved a Jury award in the International Federation of Landscape Architecture's Student Design Competition, announced at a prize giving ceremony on 9 April.

The competition attracted 140 entries from around the world, with the top 15 prize winners invited to attend the event held in association with the IFLA World Congress in Auckland.

In a joint submission, Olivia Bird and Jack Earl also received a commendation, placing them in the top 15 in the competition.

Associate Professor and Head of School of Landscape Architecture Dr. Jacky Bowring says the awards are recognition not only of the students’ skills, but also their role as upcoming leaders in the field.

“Our students are the only New Zealand students to gain any recognition in this competition, and it is impressive to see them making their mark internationally” says Dr. Bowring.

“The competition theme was 'Redemptive Landscape Architecture’, seeking to find ways in which landscape architecture can contribute to post-disaster recovery.

“While the theme is very relevant at a personal level for many of our students, this competition also demonstrates how the design of the landscape can assist with rebuilding, rehabilitation, and restoration at a regional and national level, and the management of a sustainable future.”

Ms. Aleksandrova’s entry focused on Sumner and how the beachside suburb could respond to post-quake recovery and the anticipation of rising sea levels. She says she was excited to gain international endorsement of her work.

“It was a real honour for me to be acknowledged by a jury of international experts in this field,” says Ms. Aleksandrova. “I am passionate about the role landscape architects play in the recovery process and how this can help strengthen communities; I am also very excited to be able to align my career with my interest in this field. I look forward to future opportunities to learn and challenge myself in the profession.”

Ms. Bird and Mr. Earl’s entry focused on the portside suburb of Lyttelton – also highlighting earthquake recovery.

Dr. Bowring says the awards are a measure of Lincoln University’s strength in design, as well as research, theory and design critique.

“Competitions like this encourage our students to challenge themselves and demonstrate innovation, creativity and initiative in response to a design brief very similar to a ‘real world’ application. This not only helps to prepare them for a professional role, but also showcases their talent to prospective employers – in New Zealand and abroad.

“This year’s results adds to a series of successes in IFLA competitions by Lincoln University students over the years.”
