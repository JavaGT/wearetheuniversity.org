**Lincoln University scholar stirred it up on the cooking scene**

Lincoln University Future Leader scholar and third year Bachelor of Commerce student Ella Krauts competed in the latest television series of Masterchef NZ.

“Ella is one of our Future Leader scholars, which is our scholarship programme that supports students of high academic calibre to realise their leadership potential while undertaking tertiary study,” says Future Leader scholarship programme manager Anna Luhrs.

“In the high pressure Masterchef NZ show each week we saw her ability to make quick decisions, be creative and extend herself, which are all important attributes in a leader. It was an absolute delight to watch one of our students calmly cook her way through the show and we couldn’t be prouder of what she achieved making it to the top five”.

Currently in her final year studying towards a Bachelor of Commerce, majoring in Food Industry, the now 20-year old Ella relished her time competing in Masterchef NZ. “It’s great to be able to expand my culinary knowledge and share this experience with the other passionate competitors. One highlight was spending my 20th birthday at Dolphin Island in Fiji – a truly once in a life time experience.

“I love cooking especially for friends and family. While I’m most confident and enjoy cooking Asian-inspired meals, I want to demonstrate, particularly to my generation, that cooking is fun, affordable, enjoyable, and not complicated. The tips and tricks I learnt from both the judges and other competitors will assist me in achieving this.”

Not only is Ella studying full-time, she is also working part-time as a chef at The George Hotel. “It just shows you the doors that can open up for you when you appear on Masterchef NZ.

“I’m enjoying every moment working in a professional kitchen, however it’s important to me to finish my degree at Lincoln University this year,” says Ella. “The skills and knowledge I’m gaining at university will leave me in good stead to pursue my dreams of either owning a restaurant or food manufacturing business. Although in my immediate future I’m looking to pursue a career as a chef. I think I might move to Queenstown next year and work for Josh at Rata.

“I can’t thank the University enough for their support and understanding while I took the time to compete in Masterchef NZ and to continue with my studies.”
