**Tourism and global change – what does it mean?**

Tourism is an exciting, diverse and important industry for New Zealand and the world, however it is influenced by many external factors that can’t be controlled. One of those factors is global change. How is global change shifting consumption patterns? What are the emerging markets? How do you respond when Mother Nature intervenes? These are three of many questions to be discussed at the Council for Australasian University Tourism and Hospitality Education (CAUTHE) conference, being held at Lincoln University from Monday 11 to Thursday 14 February.

Established in 1992, CAUTHE represents universities in Australia and New Zealand that teach and research tourism and hospitality. This, the 23rd annual conference, is the first to be held outside of Australia and Lincoln University is honoured to be the first New Zealand university to host this highly prestigious annual conference.

This year’s conference theme focuses on tourism and global change and will include a varied programme focusing on tourism, risk and resilience; global change and the environment; tourism, productivity and innovation; transforming people and places through tourism; and indigenous tourism in a changing world – among many other themes.

Over three days, over 200 attendees will hear from a variety of experts from all over the world, including Professor John Urry from Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, who will address attendees via video link. One of Professor Urry’s focuses is on industries of significance in contemporary western societies, namely consumer services and especially tourist-related services.

Other keynote speakers include Tim Hunter, CEO, Christchurch & Canterbury Tourism and Professor Regina Scheyvens from Massey University. The focus for Tim’s address is how the earthquakes have impacted tourism in Canterbury. Regina’s address is on ‘Sun, Sand and Social Responsibility: Can Tourism Corporations Save the World?’. Her interest in tourism derives from a passion to uncover sustainable, equity-enhancing development strategies that can improve the livelihoods and wellbeing of people in developing countries.

Lincoln University’s Professor of Tourism, David Simmons is looking forward the bringing together of academics from around the globe who all share a passion and resolve to ensure tourism is sustainable, successful and relished. “Tourism is incredibly important to New Zealand’s economy and people” says Professor Simmons.

“Lincoln University hosts the longest running undergraduate programme in tourism in New Zealand and over the past three decades has been most active in tourism and hospitality research. We have a duty of care to ensure we mitigate risks associated with tourism (bio-security, resource, yields etc) through research and education. That way we can ensure a way forward for tourism to be better prepared for global change.”
