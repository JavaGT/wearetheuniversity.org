**Lincoln University Media Alert: Ongoing Lincoln insurance settlement delivers significant sum**

_Lincoln University and its insurers have agreed to a further $25 million partial settlement of its earthquake related insurance claims._

• This covers a further 96 assets including Lincoln’s iconic Ivey West Memorial Hall, which suffered significant damage in the 4 September 2010 earthquake.

• It follows on from the $11.5m partial settlement reached back in September, which related to 140 mainly smaller buildings on the University’s Te Waihora campus.

• Vice-Chancellor Professor Robin Pollard says this settlement is a good step forward in resolving Lincoln University’s claims.
