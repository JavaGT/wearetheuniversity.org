Graduates told to value ‘international dimension’ of their study

The importance of education, tolerance and understanding as a basis for improving international relations and promoting global opportunities was stressed by Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field in his 2007 Graduation Ceremony address in Christchurch Town Hall today. (20 April)

Professor Field said that Lincoln University sought to provide internationally relevant qualifications so that its graduates could “participate in the breadth of opportunities that confront countries, economies, industries and the many different groups in society”.

“All countries require well educated and informed societies,” he said, and he told the graduates that irrespective of their specific qualifications, in today’s world they would be involved in employment activity of international importance.

“It is vital that all graduates understand the importance of the international dimension of their chosen area of study.”

Professor Field said that Lincoln University had a proud history in international education and clear expectations of its graduates.

These expectations related to the University’s values of academic freedom, quality, professionalism, international perspective, ethical standards and accountability.

The Vice-Chancellor hoped that these values would be reflected in the future lives and careers of those graduating.
