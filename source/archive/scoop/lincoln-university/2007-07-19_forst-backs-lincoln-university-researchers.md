FoRST backs Lincoln University researchers
==========================================

FoRST backs Lincoln University researchers to reduce nitrate leaching from  
grazed pasture soils

Lincoln University´s commitment to the agricultural industry´s battle to reduce  
nitrate leaching and the associated problems of water contamination and  
greenhouse gas emissions has received a Government funding boost of  
$5.5 million from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.

Announced on 18 July, the FoRST contract, one of six awarded to Lincoln  
University in 2007 to a total value of $16.2 million, supports the  
internationally recognised soil and environmental research of Professor  
Keith Cameron and Professor Hong Di.

In the past 10 years the scientists have developed a successful nitrification  
inhibitor technology that also delivers a production benefit.

Now, with FoRST funding, the two Lincoln University scientists, along with  
AgResearch, Dexcel and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, will be able to  
improve the scientific understanding of soil biology/chemistry as a platform  
for increased control over nitrogen cycling in soil.

They are hoping to control the ammonia oxidation rate and reduce nitrate  
leaching by 50 percent from major dairy pasture soils across New Zealand.

New Zealand´s dairy industry contributes 20 percent of the country´s total  
export earnings and is targeting a 35 percent increase in milk production by  
2015\. The industry has also targeted a 50 percent reduction in nitrate  
leaching from its dairy pastures by the same date.

New nitrogen management tools will be delivered to end-users through the  
research team´s strong connections with the dairy and fertiliser industries  
and regional councils.

The leaders of the Lincoln University research Professor Cameron and  
Professor Di describe today´s announcement as exciting because the  
FoRST funding will enable them to improve fundamental understanding of  
nitrification processes in soil.

They say that this will help to achieve the environmental goals of the dairy  
and fertiliser industries.
