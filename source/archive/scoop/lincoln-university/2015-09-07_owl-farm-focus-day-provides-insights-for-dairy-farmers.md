For Immediate Release

**Owl Farm Focus day provides insights for dairy farmers**

An upcoming farm focus day will be an opportunity for the dairy farming community to see a dynamic joint venture demonstration farm in operation and hear from industry experts.

Owl Farm, the St Peter’s School and Lincoln University Demonstration Dairy Farm, will host its third farm focus day of the year on 16 September, with guest speakers from DairyNZ and PGG Wrightson Seeds. Owl Farm Demonstration Manager, Doug Dibley, will also give an update on the season to date and provide some insights, along with financial analysis of options for dairy farm systems at the current pay-out.

The goal of Owl Farm is to apply proven research, utilising good on-farm practice and scientific monitoring to provide an example of optimal production, economic performance and environmental sustainability. Doug is developing a blueprint for this, in conjunction with the farm’s partners, through the work being done at Owl Farm. He sees the farm as part of a broader strategy to develop agri-business and strengthen the primary sector.

“Collectively ensuring that as an industry we are both economically and environmentally sustainable is top of the agenda,” says Doug. “We recognise the need to develop a knowledge base around these topics given their current focus. Owl Farm is a valuable resource for the farming community, providing access to world class resources, information and on-farm practices. The farm focus days are an opportunity for farm owners, farm workers and rural professionals to meet, network and share ideas.”

At the Farm Focus Day on Wednesday 16 September, representatives from two of the farm’s seven sponsorship partners will share their knowledge for the benefit of dairy farmers operating in the current challenging environment. DairyNZ will present on ‘Targeting Pasture Residuals to Optimise Utilisation’ while PGG Wrightson Seeds will be asking the question ‘To summer crop or not?’
