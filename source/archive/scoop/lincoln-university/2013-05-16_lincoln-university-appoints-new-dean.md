Lincoln University appoints new Dean for the Faculty of Commerce

Lincoln University is pleased to announce the appointment of Associate Professor Hugh Bigsby as the new Dean of the Faculty of Commerce.

Assistant Vice-Chancellor, Scholarship and Research, Stefanie Rixecker is delighted that Dr. Hugh Bigsby has been appointed as the new Dean.

“Dr. Bigsby brings expertise from the primary industries through his expertise in forestry, alongside strong academic credentials in the discipline of economics. He not only brings a superb mix of scholarly, industry and government-related experiences to the role of Dean, but he also brings management experience within specific projects as well as in former roles as Head of Department and Acting Dean,” says Associate Professor Stefanie Rixecker.

Dr. Bigsby was instrumental in developing the Lincoln University Postgraduate Diploma in Sustainable Tropical Forest Management, which is taught in Sarawak, Malaysia, in association with the Sarawak Timber Association. The aim of this postgraduate diploma is to provide students with an internationally recognised university qualification in sustainable tropical forest management and equip them with an enhanced skill-set for their work in Sarawak’s timber industry.

As Lincoln University looks to the future, it is this innovative and successful approach to creating educational opportunities with and for industry that illustrates the type of collaborative and beneficial partnerships Lincoln University wishes to grow and strengthen as New Zealand’s only specialist land-based university.

Dr. Bigsby says he is excited about the appointment and is looking forward to the positive changes ahead.

“I’ve been at Lincoln since 1993 and I am passionate about academia and tackling head-on the challenges New Zealand and the world are facing around the use of land in the business sense. I’m looking forward to moving ahead in this role and ensuring the Faculty of Commerce at Lincoln University makes a positive and valuable contribution to the education and success of our future leaders,” says Dr. Bigsby.

Originally from Canada, Dr. Bigsby joined Lincoln University in 1993 and since July 2012, he was Acting Dean of the Faculty of Commerce, following the retirement of Dr. Patrick Aldwell.
