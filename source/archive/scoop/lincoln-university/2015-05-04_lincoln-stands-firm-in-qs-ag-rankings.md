Lincoln stands firm in QS ag rankings

Acknowledgment of Lincoln University’s position as a world-leading provider of academic programmes in agriculture was further solidified with the latest round of world university subject rankings from Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).

Lincoln continues to hold its place in the 51-100 bracket in the field of agriculture and forestry. In all, more than 3000 universities are assessed under the QS ranking system, with just 200 finding their way into the Agriculture and Forestry subject bracket.

The University also sits within the top 10 for agriculture and forestry in the wider Oceania region.

The ranking methodology employed by QS includes factors such as academic reputation, citations per faculty, employer reputation, and faculty to student ratio.

“It’s great to see Lincoln University hold its position in the QS rankings for agriculture,” says Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Professor Bruce McKenzie.

“It’s also worth noting that a significant proportion of our agricultural research overlaps into other academic fields, such as environmental management, ecology, and bio-protection.

“Even without factoring in the interdisciplinary nature of our land-based research, the current world ranking can be seen as a ringing endorsement of the quality and relevance of our teaching and research in agriculture.

“Vindication of this was displayed last year in the Government’s announcement of a $107.5 million in-principle investment in new science facilities and its announcement in 2013 of the Lincoln Hub.”
