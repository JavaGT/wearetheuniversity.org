Six hundred and thirty degrees and diplomas, including 20 doctorates, will be awarded at Lincoln University’s 2001 graduation ceremony, set for the afternoon of 27 April, in Christchurch Town Hall.

The degrees and diplomas cover 17 different broad discipline areas with the doctorates ranging over fields as diverse as avian ecology, fibre science, primary production development and animal health.
