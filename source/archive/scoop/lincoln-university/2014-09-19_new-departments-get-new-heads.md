**New departments get new heads**

  
Lincoln University has announced its Head of Department appointees for the four newly established departments making up the recently revamped Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce (previously the Faculty of Commerce).

The appointees are:

• _Dr Tracy-Anne De Silva_: Department of Financial and Business Systems

• _Dr Michael Lyne_: Department of Agribusiness and Markets

• _Mr Guy Trafford_: Department of Land Management and Systems

• _Dr Mark Wilson_: Department of Global Value Chains and Trade

The new departments and the new faculty name are the latest in a series of developments aimed at enhancing the Faculty’s relevance to the agribusiness and food marketing sector.

One example of changes made in recent times include last year’s qualifications reform, which involved consultation with industry and was instigated to ensure the University’s business programmes remain aligned to the commercial needs and changing landscape of the primary sector.

“I’m very pleased to be able to welcome these individuals into these very important positions,” says the Dean of the Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce, Hugh Bigsby. “I’m looking forward to working with them to ensure the Faculty achieves its goal of being known as the premier provider of tertiary level agribusiness programmes in Australasia.

“The investment and changes we have made so far represent our commitment to agribusiness: an industry which is tremendously important for New Zealand’s economic viability, and one with enormous potential,” he says.
