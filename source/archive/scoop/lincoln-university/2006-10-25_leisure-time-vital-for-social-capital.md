Leisure Time Vital for Social Capital and Quality of Life

Lincoln University Researcher to Lead Growing Academic Community

One of Lincoln University’s senior staff has been selected to head an Australasian association for researchers and academics specialising in the study of leisure activities, including sport, physical recreation, outdoor recreation, the arts and entertainment.

Grant Cushman, Professor of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, has been elected President of the Australian and New Zealand Association for Leisure Studies (ANZALS).

ANZALS is the Australian and New Zealand association for academics, researchers and professionals with an interest in leisure research, teaching and scholarship. Leisure encompasses a wide range of phenomena, including sport, outdoor recreation, tourism, the arts, entertainment, culture and play.

Professor Cushman says the serious study of leisure has increased in significance in many countries.

“As the pace of life increases and the effects of globalisation invade more areas of everyday life, free time becomes an increasingly precious resource. For those who are experiencing a shortage of free-time, and for the growing numbers looking forward to abundant free time in retirement, leisure has never been more vital for ensuring individual and social health and well-being, as well as the enhancement of social capital and quality of life.”

Professor Cushman has also been appointed as Interim Chair for the World Leisure Commission on Law and Policy and has been invited to join the International Editorial Advisory Board of the World Leisure Journal. Founded in 1952, World Leisure is a world-wide, non-governmental association of individuals and organisations dedicated to discovering and fostering the conditions that best permit leisure to serve as a force for human growth, development and well-being.
