Trio’s commitment to Lincoln celebrated

A committed trio more used to working hard behind the scenes had their time in the spotlight this week, as each were presented Lincoln University medals.

The awards recognise their long-term meritorious voluntary service and support to Lincoln University.

Lincoln University Chancellor, Tom Lambie, says all three had made, and were continuing to make, a big difference to the University in their roles.

Medal recipient, volunteer rugby coach Noel Hickford, is known as the “godfather of Lincoln University rugby”, and is a mentor, both on and off the field.

He has spent the past 12 years coaching many promising young “All Blacks-in-training” through the Lincoln University Rugby Club.
