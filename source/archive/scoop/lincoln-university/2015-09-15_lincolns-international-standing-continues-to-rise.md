Lincoln’s international standing continues to rise

**Lincoln’s international standing continues to rise**

New Zealand’s specialist land-based university has risen a further 42 places in the world top 500, according to international ranking figures released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings for 2015-16.

The just-released ranking report sees all eight New Zealand universities back in the top 500, with Lincoln increasing its ranking from 411-420 last year, to 373.

Lincoln made the top 500 for the first time in 2013, as its small size and specialist nature meant the University traditionally struggled to enter the ranking system.

“We are very pleased to have continued to rise in the rankings this year. Jumping 112 places since joining the QS ranked universities in 2013 is an incredible achievement and a testament to the quality of Lincoln’s research and teaching.

“We’ve made a lot of changes recently, building on what is great about Lincoln’s past to ensure we meet the needs of the future – so it is good to see these changes paying off in increased recognition and standing worldwide,” says Lincoln University Acting Vice-Chancellor Jeremy Baker.

By some estimates, there are more than 10,000 universities around the world, with only 3,000 eligible for ranking under the QS system.

This means Lincoln now sits in the top 4 per cent of world universities and the top 12 per cent of those ranked by QS.
