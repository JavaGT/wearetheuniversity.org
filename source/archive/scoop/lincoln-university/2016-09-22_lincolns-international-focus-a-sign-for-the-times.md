Lincoln University News Alert: Lincoln’s international focus a sign for the Times

_Lincoln University is being recognised for its global reach._

• Lincoln University’s international co-authorship of research papers, where its academics work in partnership with overseas experts, and high percentage of international students have pushed it into the top 100 among the world’s universities.

• When combined with all other criteria Lincoln ranked in the 401-500 bracket, joint fifth out of the eight universities in New Zealand. The ranking is out of 980 institutions worldwide.

• Chair of the University Research Committee Professor David Simmons says the criteria which place Lincoln in the top 100 rankings reflect the desire of overseas academics to work with Lincoln’s experts and its standing in combating global issues.
