Award for high performing sport manager

Athletic Performance Manager Richard Deuchrass’ work at Lincoln was recognised with an ‘Outstanding contribution to enhance sports performance’ award at the Marriotts/Hadlee Sports Awards on 4 March.

Richard manages the strength and conditioning, testing, recovery protocols and nutrition components of the Lincoln University Sports Scholarship Programme, as well as the increasingly resourced area of athlete mind-space, more commonly known as sports psychology.

His work contributes to provincial programmes in eight sports.

Richard says he is driven by always searching for ways to do things better.  
“One of my favourite quotes is ‘progress is impossible without change’.

“Whether it be the student-athletes, myself or my team, the aim is to strive to make the effort to do the best they, and we are capable of 100 per cent of the time,” he says.

The results of that search have recently been felt on the netball court, rugby field, and basketball court for Lincoln, and through the long line up of Lincoln students who have represented their province and country at elite and age group level, with Richard’s, and his team’s, support.

“My philosophy is based around the idea that educating athletes — increasing their awareness of what high performance attitudes, beliefs and habits are — is critical to success,” he says.

The establishment of the programme’s values — communication, integrity, grit and accountability — in conjunction with the student-athletes has been an important step.

“Values that also help grow good character in young adults which they can ‘live’ in life, help them overcome obstacles, stay focussed and add value to their sport or community where they will eventually work and live in.

  
“If we can connect, build trust, show our athletes we care, we can then make a good athlete better, and we can inspire them.”

He says most athletes don’t realise the impact they have on those that help them.

“Particularly when they are successful, many share in this success whether it be strength and conditioning coaches, managers, coaches, physiotherapists or any other support staff – the athlete’s own performance and success inspires me.”

He wants to thank Lincoln University for acknowledging and backing sport for students.  
“The support and autonomy from the management team over the years allows me to do what I do. And to recognise the many athletes, coaches and support staff, past and present who have congratulated me, it has been very humbling, ” Richard adds.
