Lincoln University Corrects Students’ Association

Release to Scoop – July 9 2009

Lincoln University Corrects Students’ Association Error

Lincoln University management has expressed concern at its Students’ Association issuing a media release containing grossly inaccurate information.

Vice-Chancellor Roger Field says the University’s newly released annual report shows it ended 2008 with a deficit of $1.3m, when all activities of the  
University are accounted for.

The Students’ Association has released a statement citing a $22m deficit.

Professor Field says he has spoken to the Students’ Association, which has committed to publicly correcting its error.

“The University and the Association have a constructive relationship,” he says. “The Association makes a valuable contribution to academic decision-making  
and we are committed to working with it to provide the high-quality academic environment and support for students that Lincoln University is well known for.”
