**Lincoln University Scoots Off To Holiday Hotspots**

Is it a bird, is it a plane? No, it’s a Lincoln University Orange Roughie scooting across the South Island’s holiday hotspots spreading the good news about studying at Lincoln.

Adorned in orange capes with the Lincoln University logo, sporting orange wigs under their helmets and driving Vmoto scooters, these Orange Roughies will be in Queenstown, from 29th until 31st December.

Targeting predominantly school leavers, the riders will be handing out Lincoln University brochures, Frisbees, and V Black, the new energy drink from Frucor.

Scooting around beaches, parks and camping grounds, the Orange Roughies will be posing the question Have You Done It Yet? to school leavers considering enrolling at university next year.

Lincoln University spokesperson Anna Stoddart says the Orange Roughies promotion is a fun way of spreading the word of Lincoln University and all it has to offer students.

“At this time of year, school leavers are celebrating the end of an era and looking forward to a new one. Our campaign is light-hearted, but at the same time will be an important reminder that enrolment time is fast approaching,” says Anna Stoddart.

The Orange Roughies will be stopping off in Queenstown from 29th until 31st December. Holidaymakers in Wanaka, Christchurch and Nelson should keep an eye out for the Orange Roughies from 1st until 3rd January.
