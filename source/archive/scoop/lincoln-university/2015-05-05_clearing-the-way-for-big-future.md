Clearing the way for big future

Clearing the way for big future

It might look ominous to the passing motorist, but the fenced-off construction site at Lincoln University is the next chapter in an exciting range of ongoing developments for both the campus and region.

The Hilgendorf complex of buildings, which have traditionally accounted for approximately 30 per cent of the University’s academic floor space, are being stripped and utilities diverted in preparation for deconstruction.

The work is designed to clear the way for the construction of new teaching and research facilities as part of a campus master plan.

The finer detail of the campus work is yet to be finalised; however, along with state-of-the-art academic facilities, one of the first projects will be a major student centre incorporating a range of student services.

“The announcement by the Government last year for a $107.5 million in-principle commitment to Lincoln’s future development was the green light we needed to push on with these developments,” says Corporate Services Group Manager, Murray Dickson.

“We feel there has been growing awareness in the general public’s understanding, particularly in urban New Zealand, as to the importance, scope and opportunities inherent in the land-based industries and related areas. This is a message we have been pushing for some time now.

“These new developments stand as a ringing endorsement of the role Lincoln has played, and will continue to play, in this key space.”

Significantly, the campus developments will also be tied to the strategic needs of the upcoming Lincoln Hub.

Announced by the Government in April 2013, the Lincoln Hub is a major development project designed as a strategic collaboration between industry, research and education. As well as Lincoln University, Hub partners include DairyNZ, and Crown Research Institutes, AgResearch, Landcare Research, and Plant & Food Research.

It is also expected that the Hub will have significant involvement with wider industry.

The overarching objective of the Lincoln Hub is to transform the productivity and performance of New Zealand’s primary sector and enhance sustainability outcomes.

It is anticipated the Hub will form the most significant concentration of environmental and land-based researchers in the Southern Hemisphere, with around 900 scientists expected to be located on a site that will encompass the land surrounding the Ellesmere Junction Road and Springs Road roundabout at Lincoln.

All of this follows on from the opening in 2014 of the University’s new Food and Function Centre, Te Kete Ika.

“This is a tremendously exciting time for both Lincoln University, the Selwyn region, and New Zealand’s land-based industries,” says Murray Dickson.
