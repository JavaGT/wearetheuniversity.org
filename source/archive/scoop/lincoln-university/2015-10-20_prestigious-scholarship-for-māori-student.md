Prestigious scholarship for Māori student  

  
A Lincoln University Master’s student has been awarded a prestigious scholarship that aims to increase Māori participation in the fisheries and aquaculture industries.

Roxanne Lloyd, who is studying towards a Master of Applied Science in Environmental Management, received the Rona Scholarship at the recent 2015 Ngā Whetū Hei Whai: Charting Pathways for Māori Industry Future Conference.

Each year, the Te Pūtea Whakatupu Trust awards up to 10 of these scholarships to Māori who are completing degrees in fisheries, aquaculture or marine sciences.

“It was great to be given the opportunity to go to the Ngā Whetū Hei Whai conference,” Ms Lloyd says. “There were a number of inspiring speakers, such as Sir Mason Durie, Dr Ernesto Sirolli and the Minister of Māori Development, Hon Te Ururoa Flavell.

“All the speakers encouraged and inspired us to work hard and achieve our goals as Māori. The conference was a chance to network with people from different fields. I think the people I met and the relationships I made at the conference will help me achieve my goals and future plans.”

Ms Lloyd’s Master’s research involves exploring the pattern of marine farm locations throughout New Zealand and investigating how climate change can play a role in determining the best sites for such farms.

“Climate change can affect a number of important resources that humans rely on,” she says. “In particular, aquaculture provides a food source, but an increase in water temperature or ocean acidification can alter the environments needed to farm certain species.”

Her research involves mapping the marine farm locations using GIS and agent-based modelling.

“I have always had an interest in GIS, and have been able to learn a new skill while carrying out this research.”

Ms Lloyd started working towards her Master’s degree at Lincoln in April this year, after completing an undergraduate degree and postgraduate diploma at the University of Canterbury.

“I decided to make the change to Lincoln for my Master’s thesis because I wanted to take part in research that would help improve the way in which humans use and manage the environment and its resources.”
