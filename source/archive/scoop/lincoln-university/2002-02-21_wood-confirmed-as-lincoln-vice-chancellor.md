Wood Confirmed As Lincoln Vice-Chancellor For Further Term

Lincoln University Council has resolved to renew the contract of Dr Frank Wood as Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University for a further five-year term.

Dr Wood took up the role of Vice-Chancellor on 1 March 1997.

Over the past six months a Lincoln University Council committee has conducted an extensive evaluation of the scope of the job and a detailed review of Dr Wood’s performance.

The committee also consulted with the State Services Commission, as it is obliged to, in order to obtain its concurrence.

“In making the contract renewal recommendation to the University Council I expressed the gratitude of the Council to Dr Wood for his contribution to Lincoln University and his excellent performance and leadership over the past five years,” says Lincoln’s Chancellor, Margaret Austin.
