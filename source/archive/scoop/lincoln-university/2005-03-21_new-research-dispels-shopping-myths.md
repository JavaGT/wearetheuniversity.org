New Research Dispels Shopping Myths

New research by Lincoln University is dispelling some common assumptions about our shopping habits.

Over a thousand shoppers were surveyed in 12 different shopping malls across Christchurch; the results have been collated by Charles Lamb, a Senior Marketing Lecturer at Lincoln University.

“Some of the results are surprising and fly in the face of common assumptions about why we shop where we do,” says Charles Lamb.

“For example, free and easy parking is often cited as one of the main reasons people to go mall. Our survey shows this is not the case,” says Charles Lamb.

“91.7% of our respondents cited either proximity (60.2%), convenience (16.9%) or variety and quality (14.6%) as the reasons they were shopping at a mall. Easy and free parking was cited by only 1.4% of the people we spoke to.”

Another surprising finding is the number of men who shop for relaxation and enjoyment.

“People often think men dislike shopping – it’s seen as women’s sport. However, 40% of the men we spoke with agreed they shop for relaxation and enjoyment,” says Charles Lamb.

The research also revealed the age group which most frequently visits shopping areas – teenagers.

“Nearly two-thirds of teenagers surveyed visit malls and the central city shopping area at least once a week. Unfortunately for retailers, while teenagers are the most frequent shoppers, they have the lowest incomes,” says Charles Lamb.

We also shop together. For people in the 20+ age bracket, 78 percent of them said they were shopping with family or friends. For teenagers, this figure jumped to 88 percent.

The research also contains some interesting analysis of central city shoppers.

“While 60% of teenagers said they visited the central city at least once a week, yet only half that number of over 20 year olds went into the central city as often,” says Charles Lamb.

Charles Lamb says the research has some very interesting results for mall owners and city planners.

“The survey shows that people are very mobile, not particularly loyal to any given mall and that most of the people visiting a particular shopping area are there because it’s close to them, ” concluded Charles Lamb.
