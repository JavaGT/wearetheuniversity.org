Lincoln Student Diagnosed With TB

A Lincoln University student is in hospital after being diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB).

TB is treatable and curable in most cases.

Primary contacts of the student (people who have had recent one-to-one interactions) are being contacted by Community and Public Health staff to establish whether they need to be tested.

Students and staff are being reassured that they are only at risk of having contracted the disease if they have had one-to-one interactions with people who have TB. Those people have been identified by Community and Public Health, who will be in touch with them.

It is business as usual at the University.
