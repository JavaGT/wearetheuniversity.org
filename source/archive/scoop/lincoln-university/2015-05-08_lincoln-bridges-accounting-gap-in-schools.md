Lincoln bridges accounting gap in schools

Lincoln experts have been bridging a gap in the school syllabus by lending some of their financial know-how to the next generation of Rod Drury’s.

Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce lecturers were coaching scholarship accounting students at a workshop at Rangi Ruru Girls’ School last month.

Last October Lincoln also hosted students on campus for a workshop on the ‘10-column worksheet’.

Department of Financial and Business Systems Head Dr Tracy-Anne De Silva says given the differences in the syllabus of NCEA Level 3 Accounting and Scholarship Accounting there is a need for teachers and students to be supported through the Scholarship Accounting exam.

“The University is in a good position to provide this support,” she says.

The need was highlighted in discussions the University’s SchoolsLinc Programme Manager Fiona Scott had with teachers.

The workshop focused on the ‘Frameworks’ in accounting, including the NZ Financial Reporting Framework and the NZ Framework. It involved a mixture of lecturing, discussion and working through tasks and scenarios.

The University produced a workbook for the students and the event was useful as professional development for teachers.

“The workshops are a way for schools to become more familiar with Lincoln, including our accounting and finance programme,” Dr De Silva says.

The students will visit the campus later in the year as part of a third scholarship accounting workshop.

Schools involved in the workshop were Rangi Ruru Girls’ School, Christchurch Girls’ High School,  
Avonside Girls’ High School, Burnside High School, Rangiora High School, Middleton Grange, Christ’s College, St Bede’s College, Christchurch Boys’ High School, Marian College, and Shirley Boys’ High School.

The Faculty of Agribusiness and Commerce was also supporting the Lion Foundation Young Enterprise Scheme (YES) by holding a Marketing Plan workshop on campus this week. The scheme gives students the chance to set up and run their own business for a year.

Students from Villa Maria College, Rangi Ruru Girls’ School, Papanui High School, St Margaret’s College, Hornby High School, Rangiora High School, Christchurch Boys’ High School and St Andrew’s College attended.
