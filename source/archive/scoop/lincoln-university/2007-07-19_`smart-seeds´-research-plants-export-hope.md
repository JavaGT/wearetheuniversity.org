\`Smart seeds´ research at Lincoln University plants hope of export earnings bonanza

Revolutionary Lincoln University research to develop "smart seeds" for forage and vegetable brassica crops capable of naturally resisting pests and diseases without recourse to genetic modification or chemical interference has received Government backing of $5.2 million.

The funding was announced on 18 July by the Foundation for Research Science and Technology (FoRST).

Behind the project is a seed industry aim to give New Zealand an internationally competitive export edge with its products. The current value of brassica seed exports, for example, is $12.6 million but with "smart seeds" it´s believed a five-fold increase could be achieved within 15 years.

Chemical and genetic modification approaches to pest and disease control are increasingly confronted by consumer resistance on health and environmental grounds. Lincoln University´s internationally respected track record in alternative bio-control approaches is reflected in the awarding of this research contract.

The research and development work will centre on the principle of coating the surface of seeds or incorporating within the seeds naturally occurring microbes with activated or enhanced biological attributes which will provide tolerance or protection against a range of specific pests and diseases. In the case of vegetables (eg. cabbage and pak choi) and forage crops (eg. rape and turnip) the protection will target the economically costly problems of black rot, club root, water soft rot and damage from diamondback moth.

Funding is for a six-year period with the project managed by Professor Alison Stewart, Director of Lincoln University´s Centre of Research Excellence, the National Centre for Advanced Bio-Protection Technologies. The Science Leader for the work is the University´s Professor of Seed Technology, John Hampton and the seed industry partners are South Pacific Seeds (NZ) Ltd and PGG Wrightson Seeds Ltd. The industry partners and the Foundation for Arable Research are also investing in the project.

The project has four stages - identifying appropriate bioactive agents; developing a prototype seed product; identifying innate and external factors affecting the biocontrol agents; and validating the final seed product. Science Leader Professor Hampton is delighted that a seed industry project has attracted FoRST funding.

This is the first time that the industry has received such support and it is a clear acknowledgement of the importance of the seed industry to New Zealand.

"The project was developed with the involvement of the Lincoln Resource (made up of the Foundation for Arable Research, Crop & Food Research, AgResearch, Landcare Research, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Selwyn District Council, Lincoln University and Plantwise) from a concept firmed up after consultation with the New Zealand seed industry.

"The researchers are delighted with the outcome of this FoRST funding round and we are looking forward to developing \`smart seeds´ as a contribution to New Zealand´s export edge in products based on our emerging strength in biotechnology."
