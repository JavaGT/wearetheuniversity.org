Recognition for unselfish Fellow  

Lincoln University Professor of Systems Biology Don Kulasiri has had international recognition of his work, being made a Fellow of the Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand (MSSANZ).

MSSANZ is a society for scientists, engineers, economists and social scientists who develop and use computer based models and decision support systems. Professor Kulasiri’s focus is on computational modelling/analysis of biological and environmental systems and Biotechnology and BioSystems engineering.

The award is presented for 'unselfish dedication to promoting the aims of the Society, and for outstanding contributions to modelling and simulation'. It allows him to add 'FMSSANZ' to the long list of letters behind his name.

He is grateful for the award but wanted to acknowledge the contribution of others.

“More so to my colleagues who work with me in research projects. I would like to thank my current and former PhD students at Lincoln University as well, not to mention everybody else in Lincoln who make things happen.

He has had a long involvement with MSSANZ.

“I presented a paper in 1993 for the first time in Perth, and I have presented, or I have been a co-author of, our papers there ever since. I also co-convened the congress at Canterbury University in 2007.

“I guess I have contributed to the society "unselfishly" to some extent, but my guess would be our research contributions through journal articles and books made the day.”

He is one of only four New Zealanders made Fellows since the society was founded in 1974.

“When I look at the list of people who have been Fellows, they have made significant and sustained original contributions to research and/or have a long-term dedication to the society.

“Some big names are awarded medals and fellowships by the society (including a Nobel laureate) so I guess I am in a good company,” he says.

The Fellowship awards are given every two years at MSSANZ’s International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, this year on the Gold Coast in December.

“It has become a large event over the years and, for example, more than 800 refereed papers will be presented and the proceedings of MSSANZ are internationally recognised and accessed through major databases.

“Regular contingents of scientists from Europe and North America attend these congresses which are highly publicised in Australia,” Professor Kulasiri says.
