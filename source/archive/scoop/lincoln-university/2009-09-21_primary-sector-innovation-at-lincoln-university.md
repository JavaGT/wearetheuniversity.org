Primary Sector Innovation at Lincoln University

  
In the week Minister of Agriculture David Carter launched a $140million funding for primary sector innovation, he will see a farm working towards such innovation when he visits his alma mater.

The Minister will this afternoon visit Lincoln University, New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, where he studied for his Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree.

Mr Carter’s visit will include a tour of the new dairy research farm, whose work will align with the new Primary Growth Partnership thinking. He says the initiative is designed to boost productivity across the economically vital primary sectors.

“Innovation in the primary sector will be essential for New Zealand’s long-term economic growth and improved environmental performance,” he says.

Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field agrees. “If you look around the world, successful economies are recognising the importance of land-based industries as a foundation required for long-term sustainable growth.

“Lincoln University graduates are working at the forefront of economies all over the world, because we educate them here for careers that haven’t even been thought of yet. We have a definite focus on innovation, with research an integral part of all we do.

“Land underpins some of this country’s biggest opportunities and greatest challenges and the current economic situation has woken people up to the vital role land plays in our economy,” he says.
