**Highly-contested hotel management place won by Lincoln University student**

Lincoln University’s Sam Swaffield is one of just 19 graduates from Australasia to be selected for the highly-contested I-Grad Future Leaders program with InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG).

Each year IHG identifies potential high-fliers from a pool of 1000+ applicants for the 12-month I-Grad program. During the year the I-Grads work across Food & Beverage, Housekeeping and Front Office, taking on projects in each area, building their leadership competencies and learning how IHG works to remain one of the leading hotel groups in the world. On completion of the program, the graduates are placed into a role that matches their specific skill set and aspirations.

“This is exactly where I wanted to be when I finished uni,” says Sam Swaffield, Bachelor of Commerce student at Lincoln University. “The chance of getting on this program is small as there are only a few places and everyone wants one. I am really pleased to have this opportunity. I am heading back home to Auckland for my I-Grad year, to the Crowne Plaza Auckland. At the hotel, I’ll have the General Manager as my coach as well as getting on-the-job experience and exposure to all areas of hotel management.”

Dr Anthony Brien, Senior Lecturer in Business Management in the Commerce Faculty of Lincoln University isn’t surprised at Sam’s selection. “Sam is an excellent candidate for the program and future General Manager of a hotel. Within his Bachelor of Commerce degree, Sam is majoring in Hotel Management. He has the intellect to go far in the industry, but Sam also has the leadership qualities, EQ and personality to do exceptionally well in this highly demanding but rewarding sector”.

IHG’s HR Manager responsible for the New Zealand I-Grad selection process, Georgina Nicholas, says that the program is highly contested because it is open to high-potential existing staff members – who already have work experience – as well as new graduates. “Emerging talent is crucial for any organisation but especially in our industry. Our people and the service they provide are what makes our 4,500 hotels across the globe stand out. The I-Grad Future Leaders program is one way that we can select and develop some of the best talent in the industry.”

Sam Swaffield came to Lincoln University from Orewa College, north of Auckland, on one of the University’s Future Leaders scholarships. As part of his BCom degree, Sam spent time on exchange at Oregon State University. Sam is actively involved in the University rugby club, assisting with the University’s _130 Years of Rugby_ tour of New Zealand in 2011 as well as the annual Lincoln vs Massey inter-university match.

Students on the Future Leaders scholarships at Lincoln University must maintain high academic grades as well as undertake leadership development and contribute to University life in order to retain their scholarship support. Anna Luhrs, who manages the Future Leaders on campus, says “Sam has excelled in this area, being awarded the Future Leaders’ Award for Contribution to Campus Life and being a third year role model to younger students coming through. We wish him well with the (I-Grad) program. He is a fantastic young man, who will be very much missed on campus!”
