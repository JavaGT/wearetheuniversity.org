**Positive growth in student applications**

In light of the University of Canterbury’s positive announcement today regarding their increased applications, Lincoln University is also pleased to state that applications are up, compared to this time last year.

The University reached its domestic targets in 2012, however it is pleased to see that domestic applications are also up but most importantly the return in international interest is a great signal for Lincoln University and for Christchurch in general.

Lincoln University overall is up on last year by 5% - domestic applications up 3% and international applications up 11%.

All three tertiary institutions have been working together to send a message that Christchurch and the Canterbury region is still a vibrant and exciting place to study, and it looks like the message is being received.
