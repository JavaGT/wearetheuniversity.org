**Exceptional environmental research recognised by Royal Society**

Professor Keith Cameron of the Centre for Soil & Environmental Research at Lincoln University has been elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand for exceptional distinction in research.

Professor Cameron is recognised internationally for his research to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. His publications on nitrate leaching from soil and his development of on-farm technologies to measure and mitigate nitrogen losses have been utilised internationally.

Professor Cameron said that he has been fortunate to work with very talented staff and postgrad students at Lincoln University. “This is a team effort really. I am grateful to my colleagues, especially Professors Hong Di, Tim Clough, Ron McLaren and Grant Edwards, as well as a fantastic team of technicians.

“I am also grateful to Lincoln University for encouraging research and to the many funders of our research. It is a real honour to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and I feel humbled to be invited to join such a distinguished body”.

Academy Chairperson Professor Richard Le Heron FRSNZ said that being elected as a Fellow is an honour given to New Zealand’s top researchers for showing exceptional distinction in research or in the advancement of science, technology or the humanities.

“These newly elected Fellows are leaders in fields as diverse as linguistics, statistics, medicine, sustainable agriculture, electrical engineering and ancient ecology. They reflect the wide range of ground-breaking work being undertaken by researchers in science and technology, the social sciences and humanities in New Zealand.”

Twelve top New Zealand researchers and scholars altogether were elected as Fellows. The Royal Society of New Zealand now has 404 Fellows and 59 Honorary Fellows. Fellows are involved in providing expert advice, promoting best and innovative research practice and disseminating information on the sciences, technology and humanities.
