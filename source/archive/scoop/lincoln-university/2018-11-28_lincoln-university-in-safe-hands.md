Lincoln University in safe hands
================================

**Wednesday, 28 November 2018, 1:18 pm**  
**Press Release: [Lincoln University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University)**

Lincoln University is delighted to announce the appointment of Professor Bruce McKenzie as Acting Vice-Chancellor, a position he will take over from Professor James McWha in January of next year.

Professor McKenzie, currently Lincoln’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, is a well-respected, long-time member of the university community.

His Lincoln Council appointment follows the Government’s initiative to investigate an alternative structural arrangement for the university, which has resulted in partnership discussions with the University of Canterbury.

Negotiations continue and both parties will provide a proposal to Education Minister Chris Hipkins in December.

Chancellor Steve Smith says Professor McKenzie will provide solid, stable leadership as Lincoln continues to deliberate on its future structure.

“Bruce is well known to Lincoln and has a proven track record of impeccable leadership after working at the university for more than 30 years. Staff have shown overwhelming support for his appointment, and we are thrilled that Bruce has agreed to take on the role.”

Professor McKenzie’s association with the university began in the early 1980s, when he attended Lincoln as a student, completing a postgraduate diploma in agricultural science and then a PhD in agronomy and crop science.

From there, he took up a 22-year post at the university as an Associate Professor of Agronomy, responsible for teaching a range of classes in plant science, statistics and annual crop production.

In 2008, he became Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture and Life Sciences, which involved managing 150 staff members in four departments.

He worked in this role for more than seven years before becoming the university’s Chief Academic Officer, overseeing Lincoln’s academic faculties, as well as the Library, Teaching and Learning department, University Studies and English Language, and the Research Management Office.

He was appointed to the position of Deputy Vice-Chancellor earlier this year.

Outgoing Vice-Chancellor Professor McWha is expected to take on the role of Provost, which will involve offering advice, guidance and support to the university.

“The appointment of Provost will provide further stability and familiarity, allowing Professor McWha to continue to lead in the strategic development and operational implementation of initiatives as a member of the university’s senior management team,” says Chancellor Smith.

Professor McKenzie will take over as Acting Vice-Chancellor from 1 January 2019 and remain in the position until 30 June 2020.
