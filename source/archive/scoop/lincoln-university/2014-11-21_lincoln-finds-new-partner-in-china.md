Lincoln finds new partner in China  

Exploring innovative technologies for improving processing, manufacturing and quality assurance in dairy across the whole value chain is the overarching goal of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed this week between Lincoln University and Yili Industrial Group.

The MoU is the first step in a business relationship considered to be of notable value to both parties, its significance reflected in the document having been witnessed by China’s President Xi Jinping at the Agri-Tech Industry Showcase in Auckland today.

Yili is one of China’s largest processers and manufacturers of dairy products. The company has previously entered into a similar relationship with Wageninigen University in the Netherlands, which has since advanced to include the establishment of a research and development centre on the Dutch University’s campus.

The MoU aims to explore initiatives in dairy-farm and dairy processing technologies, research for improving value-add for dairy products and ingredients, the development of efficiencies in the production of dairy products, and the enhancement of supply chain quality and safety.  
Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Dr Andrew West, who, along with Yili’s Chairman Mr Pan Gang, met with President Xi and Prime Minster John Key during the witnessing of the document, believes all the signs are there for a highly constructive working relationship for both parties.

“Lincoln University is delighted to form this new relationship with Yili, a truly significant, multinational food company with a growing investment in New Zealand,” says Dr West.

“Our aspiration is for Yili to replicate with Lincoln University and the broader Lincoln Hub the research and development centre it has recently established at the Wageningen land-based Hub in Holland. We believe that the Lincoln Hub forms the southern hemisphere counterpart,” he said.
