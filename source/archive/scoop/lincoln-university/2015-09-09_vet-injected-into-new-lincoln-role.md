**Vet injected into new Lincoln role**

Dr Teresa Moore will be taking the helm of the University’s agricultural, horticultural and conservation portfolio of land as Lincoln’s new Director of Farms.

The veterinarian and Lincoln alumna will begin her new role at Lincoln’s Te Waihora campus on October 12, and has an extensive background in farm management, through running her own dairy farm and seven years of sharemilking, achieving farm production records wherever she worked.

“This is a new leadership role for the University and I am thrilled that Dr Moore is taking on the unique opportunity and responsibility to manage and influence a large portfolio of land to improve efficiencies and effective use of the land,” says Lincoln University Deputy Vice-Chancellor – Scholarship and Research, Dr Stefanie Rixecker.

Dr Moore, who has Ngāti Rangitihi and Cook Island ancestry, has also consulted for DairyNZ, initiating and developing a project to create a network of Māori farms in Taupo, and managed a national programme to help farmers work on agribusiness strategies.

She is excited about her appointment.

“The research farms are pivotal in providing scientific outcomes that benefit New Zealand agriculture and this is something that I would take great pride in being a part of.

“Having worked for DairyNZ and worked up the farming ladder to farm ownership, I am acutely aware of the importance of agricultural and horticultural research and development and more importantly the extension of outcomes to the farming public, the rural professionals that support these industries and the future farmers/professionals who will come through Lincoln University”.

She will manage Lincoln University-owned, controlled or influenced land outside of the campuses which includes farms, orchards, forests and conservation land.

Lincoln University owns and manages a variety of farm properties for four key reasons: education and training, providing first-hand farm experience for students; research and development; demonstration, for commercial farmers to take key learnings to apply to their own properties; scholarship support, for commercial profit to be applied to the support of future students.

Dr Moore’s role also involves supporting the education, research and outreach objectives of Lincoln University and maintaining strong relationships with joint venture partners on specific farms such as those at Northland College, and St Peter’s School, in Cambridge.

She began her BAgSci degree at Lincoln University in 1997 before completing her Bachelor of Veterinary Science at Massey University in 2003, and was resident veterinarian and office manager at Mapperley Stud Ltd, Matamata, before accepting the new role.

She has chaired the New Zealand Dairy Industry Awards Trust (NZDIA), and in 2009 was NZDIA National Sharemilker of the Year and an agricultural ambassador for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to Europe.
