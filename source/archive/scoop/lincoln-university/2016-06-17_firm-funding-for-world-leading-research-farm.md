Firm funding for world-leading research farm

**Firm funding for world-leading research farm**

Lincoln University’s Ashley Dene Research and Development Station is welcoming the signing of five sponsorship agreements to the value of $850,000, contributing to the creation of a world-leading farm systems research facility.

Professor of Dairy Production Grant Edwards says Lincoln greatly values the industry support which has helped to develop the Station. “In particular we are grateful to Opus International Consultants who will supply engineering expertise and project management support, Waikato Milking Systems who will supply and install advanced milking systems in the dairy shed, CLAAS Harvest Centre which will supply farm equipment and advice on equipment needs, and PGG Wrightson Seeds and Genetic Technologies (Pioneer® brand products) who will offer expert advice and supply seed.”

The goal of the three year project is to conduct farm systems research to improve the profitability, environmental and welfare performance of dairy and livestock farming systems. The facility will comprise a suite of dairy farming systems, with close integration of the arable and livestock sector.

“It has been a great pleasure to engage with the supporters over this dairy conversion and what it means to New Zealand,” says Lincoln University Farms Director, Dr Teresa Moore. “These supporters wanted to get in behind Lincoln University and enable us to undertake the valuable environmental research that is needed to ensure everyone’s longevity in farming. They saw great merit in what our objectives are for this farm, and wanted to provide the support they could to make it worthwhile and effective. We have an impressive group of supporters that we really look forward to working with to make this research and development dairy farm a success.”

Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Scholarship and Research, Dr Stefanie Rixecker says, “The Ashley Dene Research and Development Station includes significant contributions from current Lincoln Hub partners and enables new research programmes and opportunities across the partners. It is exciting to see research teams come together to investigate and solve complex problems for the betterment of our environment and to the benefit of rural and urban communities.”

**More information:**

• Ashley Dene Research and Development Station is a 190ha platform with approximately 175ha effective area which we can milk off.

• We carry out a split calving model, with 450 cows calved down in the spring and 75-80 cows calved down in the Autumn

• Start calving this July/August, first Autumn calving will be in 2017

• Infrastructure on farm includes a 54 bail rotary Waikato Milking Systems plant and machinery with Afimilk Technology being used for our automation; a feed pad and stand-off pad.

**Specific objectives**

• To improve the performance and viability of existing dairy farms within New Zealand, and to develop and test new dairy farming systems in Canterbury, within new and challenging nitrogen discharge limits on shallow stony free draining ‘leaky’ soils.

• To develop systems based on new approaches to animals, forages, soils, and the management of low cost infra-structure, that reduce the environmental impact of dairy farm systems.

• To develop robust, low-cost wintering systems for dairy cows that meet profitability, welfare and environmental targets.

• To gain an improved understanding of the use of cow genetic information across farm systems varying in the level of feeding intensity, and how this affects milk production and composition.

• To develop and demonstrate approaches to applying the practice of Kaitiakitanga appropriate to Māori and indigenous production contexts.

• To provide high quality education facilities that enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural graduates and trained rural professionals.

• To provide shared resources for Lincoln HUB partners to conduct research into improving environmental outcomes, notably greenhouse gases, soil carbon and water quality.
