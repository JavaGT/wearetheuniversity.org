Joint facility construction facing a delay
==========================================

**Friday, 7 December 2018, 7:26 pm**  
**Press Release: [Lincoln University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University)**

Lincoln University and AgResearch have been advised by government that more time is required to assess the current business case for construction of their new joint facility. This means the current proposal could not progress before March, when the advice is required.

This will mean a significant delay in the building programme, and the implications are currently being worked through by the partner organisations.

  
For Lincoln University and AgResearch the progression of a collaborative precinct remains a top priority for both organisations.

We look forward to advancing our partnership and the significant benefits it will deliver for New Zealand’s agricultural and land-based sectors, in the New Year.
