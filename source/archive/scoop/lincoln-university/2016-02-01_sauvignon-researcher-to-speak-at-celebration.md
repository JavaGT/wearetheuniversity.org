Sauvignon researcher to speak at Celebration  

  
The inaugural International Sauvignon Blanc Celebration 2016, to be held in Marlborough on 1-3 February, provides an opportunity for Lincoln University’s research in the viticulture and oenology (wine science) fields to be presented to a distinguished audience of national and international wine buffs.

Wine sensory scientist Dr Wendy Parr has been invited to speak about her 10 years of Sauvignon blanc wine sensory research in a session on The Science of Sauvignon blanc, to be led by renowned UK wine writer Dr Jamie Goode.

Dr Parr says, “It will be interesting to present our data showing how the conceptualisation of Marlborough Sauvignon blanc wines has shifted over the last decade where some changes such as less desire for intensely green characters are now showing up, and to get feedback from international wine industry professionals on these effects.

“It is a wonderful privilege and opportunity to present our Sauvignon sensory research, much of it conducted in collaboration with French scholars, to such an experienced and distinguished audience of wine professionals”.

20 guests from as far afield as Canada, the US, France, UK, and China will be speaking at the event, sharing their knowledge and experience of Sauvignon Blanc with over 350 delegates, from 18 different countries.

Five Masters of Wine are among the speakers, including David Gleave, founder of Liberty Wines in the UK, Jancis Robinson’s assistant Julia Harding, and New Zealanders Sam Harrop, Alastair Maling and Jane Skilton.
