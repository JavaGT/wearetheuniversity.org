Lincoln University medals acknowledge careers in medical research and beef industry

The recently retired Chief Executive of the Health Research Council of New Zealand, Dr Bruce Scoggins of Auckland, and Australian beef industry leader Don Lawson of Victoria, are the 2007 recipients of Lincoln University medals for distinguished lifetime contributions to the interests of their respective countries.

The awards will be made at Lincoln University’s Graduation ceremony in Christchurch Town Hall on 20 April.

Dr Scoggins receives the Bledisloe Medal, introduced by Governor-General Lord Bledisloe in 1930 for outstanding contributions by Lincoln alumni within New Zealand, and Mr Lawson receives the Lincoln University Alumni International Medal, established in 2003 for outstanding contributions by Lincoln alumni in countries outside New Zealand.

Dr Scoggins, a former Christchurch Boys’ High School student, entered Lincoln University in 1958 and graduated Bachelor of Agricultural Science then Master of Agricultural Science with First Class Honours in Wool Science. His research topic at Lincoln was the relationship between stress hormones and wool production.

Dr Scoggins continued his interest in stress hormones with PhD study at the University of Melbourne then became a Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Howard Florey Institute for Experimental Physiology and Medicine. He remained with the institute as a research scientist for almost 20 years then moved to the United States of America and the University of Colorado where he was Gordon Meiklejohn Professor of Medicine.

In 1991 he returned to New Zealand and was appointed Chief Executive of the Health Research Council of New Zealand, a post he held until December 2006. Today he heads his own health and science related consultancy in Auckland.

Mr Don Lawson came to New Zealand after schooling at Caulfield Grammar in Victoria, Australia, and entered Lincoln University in 1961. He too completed Bachelor of Agricultural Science and Master of Agricultural Science degrees. He returned home in 1968, lectured at Marcus Oldham College, Geelong, bought a farm with his father and set about establishing an Angus stud.

Don helped establish and was first president of what is now Australia’s Beef Improvement Association, which pioneered recording and genetic evaluation in the Australian beef industry.

While a board member of the National Beef Recording Scheme he and Colin Williams of Kaharau Angus, Gisborne, initiated contact with the New Zealand beef industry which resulted an Australian/New Zealand Angus Genetic Evaluation.

Along the way Don helped establish the PertAngus group which in 1970 took performance tested bulls into the marketplace.

A close association was established with Gardiner Angus Ranch in Kansas, USA, and together they rank as one of the biggest Angus breeding alliances in the world.

Don is currently chair of HotCross Genetics, a company producing designer genetics for the Queensland beef industry.

Today Don’s sons (both also Lincoln University alumni) run one of the largest Angus seedstock operations in Australia. Lawson Angus is at the forefront of innovation. In 2002 Don received the Order of Australia Medal for services to the Australian beef industry.
