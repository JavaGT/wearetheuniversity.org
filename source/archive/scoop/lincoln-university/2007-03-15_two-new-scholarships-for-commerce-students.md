Two New Scholarships for Commerce Students

Lincoln University has confirmed the availability of two new scholarships for commerce students, formed through its close links with industry groups and the business sector. A further three scholarships for property majors are currently being finalised.

Dr Patrick Aldwell, Director of the University’s Commerce Division, says the recent offers of research funding are unprecedented and reflect close relationships with industry and sector groups outside the University campus. It brings the total number of scholarships available to Lincoln commerce students to more than 50.

“We are delighted that we have attracted so much support from industry,” said Dr Aldwell. “It is always satisfying to be able to provide a new source of funding for our post-graduate students, and to have these additional scholarships in process is something quite rare.”

\- A Philpott-BERL Research Scholarship has been established to support post-graduate research in applied economics. The scholarship recognises Lincoln University alumni Brian Philpott, who co-founded the privately-owned Business Economics Research Ltd in 1958 and also established Agricultural Economics Research Unit at Lincoln in 1962. The scholarship of $7500 per annum will be offered alternately at Lincoln University and Victoria University. Preference is given to candidates in agriculture, resource economics, financial economics, business and or policy analysis, or the application of economic models. Applications close at the end of March 2007.

\- The Agribusiness and Economics Research Unit (AERU) is funding a new Master’s scholarship in economics. The $10,000 scholarship will allow an economics student to do thesis research as part of their work within AERU, established to conduct economic and social research around agriculture and trade issues. Recent AERU projects include the high-profile analysis of “food miles” commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Unit is also leading research in the economic and social impacts of biotechnologies in New Zealand’s primary industries. In its first year the new scholarship will be offered for research in the area of choice modelling, a survey technique used in economics and marketing.

\- The Property Group is finalising terms and regulations for three new scholarships. A Macquarie Goodman Scholarship will provide paid work experience and a grant of $1500 for students in the second year of a Bachelor of Commerce (Valuation and Property Management). A Colliers International Scholarship will provide similar support, also for a second-year student. A third scholarship and increased industry linkages with Lincoln University and the Property Group is currently being negotiated with CoreNet Global, an international professional body in the area of corporate real estate. These funding and professional links will be available for both undergraduate and post-graduate students in corporate real estate.

\- The AC Rayner Scholarship, recognising the contribution of economics professor, the late Tony Rayner, has been modified to allow applications from any Masters research project in the area of applied economics, including economic policy. The scholarship is to the value is $1200.

Dr Aldwell says the additional scholarships are a measure of the Commerce Division’s record in applied research and its close collaboration with the private sector and producer groups.

A number of additional scholarships are currently being negotiated.
