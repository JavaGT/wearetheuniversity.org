Lincoln Support Canterbury's Stance But Not Process

Lincoln support Canterbury's Stance but not process Lincoln University Students' Association (LUSA) announced their support for the University of Canterbury Students' Association (UCSA) in their demand for more government funding of the tertiary sector but expressed concern at the form of protest.

"The difficulty with protesting against the funding offer is that it gives institutions the option to increase student fees" said Chambers, President of LUSA. "while we agree with the Canterbury line that the funding is too little, we have to make sure that students don't end up footing the bill".

In a meeting today, the LUSA executive decided that this Friday was too soon to strike and risked misrepresenting the situation at hand. "For us, this Friday is the last day of semester and an important time for students to spend with their lecturers," said Greg Henderson, Vice President of LUSA.

"The government is preaching a knowledge society but a knowledge society comes with a price," said Maria McNeill, Women's Officer at LUSA, "If the government wants a knowledge society, they must put their money where their mouth is."
