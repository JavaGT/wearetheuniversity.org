Encouragement In Keeping On Fitness Programmes

Encouragement Big Factor In Keeping On Fitness Programmes - Researcher

The “loneliness of the long distance runner” syndrome is a prescription for an early drop-off of involvement in fitness programmes, according to Lincoln University doctoral researcher Kim Sinclair.

Conversely active support structures and formal reinforcement such as from doctors and health professionals can lift the retention rates in physical fitness programmes many times over, she says.

Kim is a speaker in a series of research seminars at Lincoln University today (Friday 12 April) to mark 30 years of parks, recreation and tourism teaching on the campus.

Lincoln pioneered parks, recreation and tourism teaching at university level in New Zealand when it first offered a Diploma in Park and Recreation Administration in 1972.

Over 100 graduates of diploma and degree courses since then are back on campus for two days of activities to mark the milestone.
