Governor-General ‘picks up trail’ at Lincoln University

Governor-General Sir Anand Satyanand, speaking at Lincoln University today (8 February), said he was happy to “pick up the trail” left by previous Governors-General who had visited the campus, and he gave the University a characteristically Kiwi “Good on you” for the work it was doing in the interests of New Zealand’s future.

Sir Anand was on the first official Vice-Regal visit to Lincoln University since 1992, when Dame Catherine Tizard held the office.

Addressing a group of professors and senior managers after they had given him a “snapshot” of applied research carried out at New Zealand’s specialist land-based university, the Governor-General said he was delighted to “pick up the trail” left by other Governors-General who had visited Lincoln University.

“I want to offer, as warmly as I can, encouragement for what is going on here.

“This University has a place in our country which deserves encouragement.

“I have jotted down key words as you have been speaking - specialist, versatile, practical. These are things that you are doing so well.”

Lincoln University, he said, appeared to have gathered a “sense of motion” from which it was now benefitting.

To Chancellor Tom Lambie and Deputy Vice-Chancellor Dr Chris Kirk, who hosted his visit he said “I get a very real sense that what you lead here is worth doing. Good on you!”

The Governor-General noted the names of alumni such as Sir Don McKinnon, Sir Ron Trotter and Dr Murray Horn, all of whom he knew, and acknowledged the immense contribution they had made to New Zealand. He added the names of other Lincoln graduates he said admired, who had served New Zealand outstandingly - former diplomat and now Member of Parliament John Hayes and former Meat NZ Chief Executive Neil Taylor.

After meeting the professors and senior managers, the Governor-General toured the George Forbes Memorial Library in Ivey hall, accompanied by Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic) Professor Sheelagh Matear and Acting Librarian Adriana de Groot, and viewed the new Landscape Architecture Building, where Head of School Neil Challenger showed him around.
