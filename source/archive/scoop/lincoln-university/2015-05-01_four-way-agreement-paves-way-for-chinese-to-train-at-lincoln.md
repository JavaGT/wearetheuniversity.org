Four-way agreement paves way for Chinese to train at Lincoln  

  
Chinese provincial government research and management personnel may soon be training at Lincoln University with the signing of a new agreement.

Lincoln experts could also be going to China and there is also the possibility of a student exchange programme.

Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, signed a memorandum of understanding in China last month with the Yangling Hi Tech Agricultural Demonstration Zone, North West Agriculture and Forestry University and the Shaanxi Administration of Expert Foreign Affairs.

In the agreement a group of research and management personnel from local government-run Yangling will be sent to Lincoln University for 14 days professional development training annually.

Lincoln University experts will also be invited to Yangling for short term research collaboration and research guidance. North West Agriculture and Forestry University and Lincoln are to explore the possibility student exchange programmes in various forms, including degree and non-degree education.

There will also be cooperation in areas such as animal husbandry and feedstock, and modern agricultural economics and management, as well as collaboration over establishing research farms.

Dr West says the four-way agreement is a significant one, and once it is more established, increasing numbers of Yangling personnel could make the trip to Lincoln University in the future.

“The whole Yangling area has been designated by the Chinese Government as the country’s agritech zone, and there is a significant number of national and international agritech companies locating there,” says Dr West.

Lincoln University has attended the annual China Agricultural Fair held at Yangling for the last two years and also attended the North West Agriculture and Forestry University 80th anniversary celebrations last year, forging relationships in the area.

There has also been a number of visits here from Yangling and North West Agriculture and Forestry University representatives.
