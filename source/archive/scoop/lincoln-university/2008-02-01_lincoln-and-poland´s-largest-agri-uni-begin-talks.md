Links to be explored between Lincoln and Poland´s largest agricultural university

Connections between Lincoln University and Poland´s oldest and largest agricultural university, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, will be revived on Monday (4 Feb.) with a campus visit by a high level academic delegation from the Polish capital.

The aim is to identify and discuss opportunities for future collaboration between the two universities.

The delegation, comprising the Chancellor, a faculty dean, two vice-rectors and an administration official, is spending the afternoon at Lincoln University giving presentations on capabilities, research, programmes and other aspects of Warsaw University of Life Sciences (WULS).

The Vice-Rector for Science, Professor Katarzyna Niemirowicz-Szczytt, will tell Lincoln University about fields of research and study, and developments in international scientific cooperation, while the Dean of the Faculty of Food Technology, Professor Andrzej Lenart, will discuss the teaching programmes and research carried out in the food technology area at WULS.

The Lincoln University visit will be hosted by Deputy Vice-Chancellor Dr Chris Kirk.

Lincoln University and Warsaw University of Life Sciences shared a five- year Memorandum of Understanding, signed in 1999 and at the time believed to be the first such agreement between any New Zealand university and Poland. Since then Lincoln has had some contact with the Polish University associated with a research project in immunology carried out by Lincoln University´s Professor Mirek Stankiewicz for the development of an animal parasite control vaccine.

Warsaw University of Life Sciences was founded in 1816 and has a student role of 25,000. A number of its courses are taught in English and it attracts a significant number of international students.
