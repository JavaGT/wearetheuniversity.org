Lincoln University has again come out on top in one of the leading national research quality measures.

The Tertiary Education Commission’s newly released Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) results put Lincoln first in the measure of average quality scores of active researchers per postgraduate and final year undergraduate student.

“It means at Lincoln you have the highest probability of being taught or supervised by a high-ranking researcher,” Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Bruce McKenzie said.

Lincoln also led that measure during the last PBRF assessment in 2012

“The PBRF rankings are a great result for Lincoln University. Our overall quality evaluation score increased by 30 percent, our ‘A’ scores by 23 percent and our ‘B’ scores went up 40 percent.

“This is due to researchers publishing in higher quality publications and improved research impact.”

The results also highlighted Lincoln strengths in land-based disciplines.

“The University’s focus on the land-based sectors is clearly evident in the data reported. We have demonstrable continued strength in the areas of agriculture and primary production, biological sciences and environmental management, and natural sciences; well supported by social sciences and management and marketing. Food and health is also a steadily growing sector for Lincoln University,” he said.

• _The Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) is a performance-based funding system to encourage and reward excellent research in New Zealand’s degree-granting organisations. It does not fund research directly but supports research, including post-graduate level teaching support._
