Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Resigns

Dr Andrew West today resigned as Vice-Chancellor of Lincoln University.

“I am proud of what the University has achieved under my leadership. It has been a fabulous three years and Lincoln is on track to become one of the world’s truly great land-based universities”, said Dr West.

“However my commitment of time, energy and focus has been so great that it is now appropriate that I refocus on my family that live in the Waikato and on my very elderly parents that live in England”, Dr West added.

“I want to wish the University every future success. It is a fabulous place to study and I’d encourage any young New Zealanders interested in careers in the country’s most important industry to enrol there”, said Dr West.

The University’s Chancellor, Tom Lambie, acknowledged Dr West’s significant contribution.

“In the past three years under Dr West the University has focused on its land-based specialisation through qualification reforms, revitalisation of capability, in-principle investment of $100m by Government in Lincoln, and growth in student enrolments”, said Mr Lambie.

“The University wishes Dr West well in his ongoing career in global agri-business and looks forward to continuing collaboration with Dr West in the future”, added Mr Lambie.
