Lincoln accepts fee stabilisation offer

Lincoln University Council today (21.8.2001) unanimously accepted the Government’s offer of a Special Supplementary Grant for fee stabilisation.

The grant is designed to hold tuition fees for all Ministry of Education funded tertiary courses next year at levels no greater than those set for the year 2000.

By accepting the offer Lincoln University has gained the right to participate in the new Centres of Excellence funding.

In accepting the deal Lincoln University joins Christchurch and Dunedin colleges of education, and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology in the South Island and the University of Waikato in the north.

“There are many competing demands for public funding at this time and grandstanding tactics are unlikely to build confidence among our many stakeholders,” said Lincoln University’s Vice-Chancellor Dr Frank Wood in recommending that Council accept the Government’s offer.

He noted that there had been “constructive” dialogue during the discussion periods and this had contributed to an improved understanding of the University’s position.

“The Minister has given an understanding to continue this dialogue with a view to revising the overall package for 2003.”
