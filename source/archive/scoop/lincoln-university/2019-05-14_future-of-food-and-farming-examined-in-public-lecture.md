Future of food and farming examined in public lecture
=====================================================

**Tuesday, 14 May 2019, 11:04 am**  
**Press Release: [Lincoln University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University)**

Newly-honoured Lincoln University Distinguished Professor Steve Wratten will be giving a free public lecture on the future of food and farming on May 30.

He was given the title by the University in March, and his celebratory lecture follows one by fellow Distinguished Professor Phil Hulme on May 9.

Distinguished Professor status is rarely granted by the University and is reserved for professors who have achieved international eminence of the highest order in their fields of research and study.

Professor Wratten’s talk will offer an in-depth analysis of how western agriculture can damage the prospects for our future food security and offers ideas for practical and sustainable improvement on how we grow our food and will include audience interactions, videos, animations and living insects

The Professor of Ecology has studied, researched and taught at the Universities of Reading, Glasgow, London, Cambridge and Southampton (UK, and Oregon State (USA). He has three professorships and three doctorates, is an elected Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and is a James Cook Scholar.

He also holds a James Taylor Award from the Canterbury Horticultural Society for Communication in Horticulture and has written or co-authored eight books, and is a frequently invited visiting scholar overseas.

His main research areas include pest biocontrol, bee ecology and agroecology. His media work includes, apart from many presentations to specialist audiences, many gardening columns for The Press, Kiwi Gardener and the Lincoln Community Newsletter.
