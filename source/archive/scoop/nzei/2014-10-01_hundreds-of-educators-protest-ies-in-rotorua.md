Hundreds of educators protest IES in Rotorua

  
Four hundred educators from around the country took their opposition to the Government's controversial Investing in Educational Success policy to the public today.

Members of NZEI Te Riu Roa meeting in Rotorua this morning affirmed their overwhelming vote of no confidence in the IES with a rally in Government Gardens outside Rotorua's iconic museum.

NZEI Te Riu Roa President Judith Nowotarski says teachers, principals and support staff from across the country are committed to promoting genuine collaboration between schools and early childhood services, but believe the IES is a top down, one size fits all model that is unworkable in the primary sector.

\"We want more investment in education that supports genuine, needs-driven, grassroots collaboration, as well as resourcing that directly benefits children. That means more investment in quality teaching In children's critical early years, better support in the classroom and for children with special learning needs, and smaller class sizes."

She says members committed to working with their school communities to oppose engagement in the IES model and instead talk to government about the real priorities for boosting student success.

The conference closes today.
