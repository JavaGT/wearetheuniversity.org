NZEI members to vote on new education roles

**NZEI members to vote on new education roles**

8 April 2014

NZEI Te Riu Roa wants the Government to produce the details of its $360-million “executive principal” and “expert teacher” package so it can discuss the proposals with members.

NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter says teachers and principals are extremely cynical about the new package because it totally ignores the biggest problem in our education system – the one in four kids who live in poverty and the impact of that on New Zealand’s student success.

The National Executive met this evening to discuss the teachers’ and principals’ reaction to the proposal and the next steps after holding earlier meetings with members around the country.

“The feedback from our members has been very clear. They have seen no evidence that the proposal will lift student success.

“They are not happy about the process and lack of consultation.

“What happens now is that we expect the Government to make a claim to vary our teacher and principal collective agreements to allow for the introduction of the new roles.

“We will be taking the whole package back to our members so for the first time they can see the whole proposal.

“Our National Executive is asking our members to give a clear direction on whether they want negotiations to vary the collective agreements to commence or whether they want nothing to do with the new roles.

“Our members will decide those next steps at a series of paid union meetings to be held following the receipt of the Government’s claims.”

ENDS
