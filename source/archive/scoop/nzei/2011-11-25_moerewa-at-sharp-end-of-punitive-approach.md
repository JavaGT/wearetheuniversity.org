**Moerewa at sharp end of punitive approach to National Standards**

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says Moerewa School in Northland is at the sharp end of the government’s punitive approach to National Standards.

The community is rallying behind the school to fight a decision by the Education Minister to close its senior secondary class, despite its students’ stunning NCEA results.

Moerewa School and its principal have been strong critics of National Standards and are not implementing them because they don’t believe they will do anything to raise the achievement of Māori students.

NZEI immediate past-President Frances Nelson says “the government says it wants to raise the tail of underachievement and Māori achievement. Moerewa School is doing that, and doing it very effectively. The government should not turn around and punish them for that”.

“What is happening at Moerewa is the sharp end of the government’s punitive approach to National Standards. That approach is being used against schools which are already performing well and making a real difference in lifting student outcomes.”

Moerewa School clearly has the confidence of its community and NZEI believes the government should listen to that as a matter of urgency.

“The government should not ignore the resolve of communities such as Moerewa, in standing up for their children’s education. What we’re seeing in Moerewa will be repeated in communities around the country if the government continues to pursue flawed policy and enforce it with unreasonable action,” Ms Nelson says.
