Area Schools Collective Agreement Settled
=========================================

**Area Schools Collective Agreement Settled**

The two education unions, NZEI and PPTA welcome the settlement of the area school teachers’ collective agreement.

The settlement is subject to ratification and will go out to members as soon as possible in the New Year.

There are 93 area schools around the country which teach students through from Year 1 to 13, and are largely located in rural areas.

The proposed settlement will give union members a four percent pay rise each year for the next three years and a $750 additional payment.

PPTA president Robin Duff is pleased with the outcome, which also gives specialist support for isolated schools.

“This will assist area schools to recruit teachers on the same terms as secondary and primary teachers,” he said.

The settlement also provides more career pathways for specialist teachers, more support for beginning teachers and an increase in professional learning days for isolated schools.

“Because area schools are small they often can’t get the subject support they need and have to travel to other schools. Learning days will give them the chance to get that support,” Mr Duff said.

NZEI Acting National Secretary Peter Monteith said “the settlement maintains a unified pay scale and introduces a range of new provisions which address the specific needs in area schools arising out of their isolation and the multi-level nature of their classes.”

The full package will be available at www.ppta.org.nz or at www.nzei.org.nz
