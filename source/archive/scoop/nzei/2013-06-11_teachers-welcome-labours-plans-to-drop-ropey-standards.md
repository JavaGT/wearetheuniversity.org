Immediate Release

Teachers welcome Labour’s plans to drop unreliable and “ropey” National Standards

NZEI Te Riu Roa says it welcomes the decision by the Labour party that it will not continue with the National-led Government’s “ropey” National Standards and would work with the sector to come up with a more robust way of assessing student achievement.

National President Judith Nowotarski says this is the right decision.

“National Standards are costly, time-consuming and do not provide any useful or sound assessment of student achievement.

“Teachers are very keen to work with any Government to assess students in order to help them identify what is needed to improve their learning.”

“There are a number of proven methods to help teachers and parents assess progress and we will work with any Government to implement a robust and reliable method of student assessment.”
