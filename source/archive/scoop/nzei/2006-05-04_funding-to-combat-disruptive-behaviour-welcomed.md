NZEI Welcomes Extra Funding to Combat Disruptive Behaviour

Education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, is pleased the Government has acknowledged the need to provide schools with more help to combat disruptive behaviour by students.

Education Minister, Steve Maharey, announced today that the Government will be providing an extra $9.5 million over four years for schools to promote positive behaviour by students and tackle disruption.

"NZEI's members working in primary, intermediate and area schools and kura kaupapa Maori, require more help in dealing with students whose extreme behaviour disrupts learning and can place students and staff at risk," says Colin Tarr, acting National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa.

"This is why we welcome today's announcement of extra Government funding to enable schools to deal with this issue."

"But we need more detail on how the money is going to be spent."

"It's essential that the Government and the Ministry of Education consult NZEI and its members working in schools as teachers, principals, support staff, and special education specialists, so we can work out the most effective way to spend the new funding," says Colin Tarr.
