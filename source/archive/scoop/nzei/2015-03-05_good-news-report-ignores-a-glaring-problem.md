Good news report ignores a glaring problem

A major issue has been ignored in a government report issued today showing that schools have become significantly more inclusive towards children with special educational needs.

The ERO report found a large and encouraging increase in the proportion of schools that are inclusive and welcoming of children with special education needs, but NZEI Te Riu Roa says inclusiveness is not the same as having adequate funding to meet children’s needs.

“We have highlighted repeatedly that about 30,000 children (three percent) have high special education needs but funding is rationed to just one percent. That means that 20,000 children miss out on assistance,” said NZEI National Executive member Lynda Stuart.

There are an additional 40,000-60,000 students with moderate special education needs, many of whom get minimal extra classroom assistance, if they receive anything at all.

Ms Stuart said schools could only do so much for children without the funding and specialist staff to ensure every child had the opportunity to succeed.

“The Inclusive Practices work that I have been involved in over the past two years with the Ministry of Education and other stakeholder groups has been very positive.

“It is great to see that ERO has noted a significant increase in inclusive practices, but it is very hard for teachers to meet the needs of every child without the necessary support, whether it be funding or specialist personnel,” she said.
