New president driven by desire for quality education for all children

28 September, 2016

  
NZEI Te Riu Roa’s new president is driven by a belief in quality public education for all New Zealand children.

Lynda Stuart is the principal of May Road School in Mt Roskill, Auckland and was elected to the two-year term at the NZEI Annual Conference in Rotorua today (Wed, Sept 28).

She has been an active member of NZEI her whole teaching career of more than 30 years.

Equity, accessibility and quality in education are her aims.

“I want to ensure a quality public education system is retained and enhanced in New Zealand, as I believe that this is the only way that we can meet the needs of all of our children in New Zealand. Ensuring that equitable outcomes are the focus for educational policy is at the heart of all that I do.”

Ms Stuart says going into an election year will mean that NZEI members will need to continue their advocacy for education.

“There have been some great wins over the years, but we need to challenge those policies that are not in the best interests of tamariki and educators."

Ms Stuart has been president of the Auckland branch of NZEI, a counsellor for NZEI and has represented NZEI on education focus and advisory groups and in public forums. She has been an active media spokesperson for NZEI and quality public education. She has also represented NZEI at international conferences and is a member of the Education Council.

She has been on NZEI’s National Executive from 2013 -2016.  
As a principal, she is a strong believer in working in partnership with Boards of Trustees, staff, students and community.

“Students deserve the very best teaching and learning opportunities available to them. That drives me in all of my work.’’

Lynda also has a strong interest and experience in the challenges facing special education and education for Māori and Pasifika students.
