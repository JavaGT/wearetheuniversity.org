Education Job Cuts Must Not Target Frontline Staff

**Ministry Of Education Job Cuts Must Not Target Frontline Staff**

Ministry of Education staff cuts must not target frontline jobs or compromise services to children with special needs, says the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.

Staff at the Ministry were told today that 100 positions will go by June next year.

NZEI represents more than 800 staff at the Ministry who provide specialist services to special needs children across the country.

“These are frontline staff who work directly with some of our most vulnerable students and any cut to the service they provide would compromise the quality education that these children and their families deserve,” says NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter.

“They already face considerable workload stress and any cuts would simply add to that and create anxiety and worry over their job security.”

The Government has stated a commitment to moving resources to the frontline but is not giving any guarantee that frontline jobs will be protected.

“It is also insisting on wholesale Budget cuts in education which will lead to job losses and reduction of quality services to children, while pouring money into misguided educational policy such as National Standards. It should get its priorities right,” says Mr Goulter.

ENDS
