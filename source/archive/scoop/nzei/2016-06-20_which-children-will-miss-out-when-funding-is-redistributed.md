Papers just released for the Government's review of education funding raise the question of which children will lose out when the pie is resliced.

"The Government is proposing to redistribute funding. This means that because there will be no increase in overall funding, some students will miss out," says NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter.
