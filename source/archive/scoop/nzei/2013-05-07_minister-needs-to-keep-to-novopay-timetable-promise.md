**Minister needs to keep to Novopay timetable promise**

The Minister for Novopay Steven Joyce’s decision to stick to the beleaguered payroll system pending the outcome of the Ministerial Review provides a degree of certainty for school staff but he needs remember his promise to have the problems fixed by June.

NZEI Te Riu Roa Past President, Ian Leckie says there are still 25-thousand problems to be sorted out and that gives some indication of the extent of the debacle.

“We are pleased that the Minister has acknowledged that schools were never adequately resourced or supported to adopt the decentralised business model and that it is still causing a lot of stress for school support staff and principals.”

“This has been a big learning exercise for the Ministry of Education and it is critical that those lessons drive action in the future.”

Mr Leckie says it is particularly important that schools and principals are consulted and listened to before any further action is taken as a result of the review.

“We also need to identify which Minister signed off on the debacle and expect that to be revealed as the inquiry unfolds.”

The Government has agreed to write off small overpayments of less than $100 per pay period up to a maximum of $300.

“We welcome this pragmatic approach as it will take unnecessary stress away from staff who might otherwise be subject to a collection process.”
