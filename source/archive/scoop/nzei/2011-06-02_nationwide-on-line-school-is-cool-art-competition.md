Nationwide on-line “School is Cool” art competition

One of New Zealand’s largest on-line art competitions, School Is Cool, has been launched to showcase artwork from children in early childhood centres and and primary schools across the country.

The competition, sponsored by NZEI’s quarterly magazine Education Aotearoa, celebrates New Zealand’s internationally well-regarded public education system – inviting teachers and students to identify and talk about what they like about school.

Education Aotearoa editor Jane Blaikie says New Zealand’s education system is ranked 5th in the world with only two OECD and two non-OECD countries rating higher than New Zealand on the internationally-moderated PISA assessments.

“We want to let parents and school communities know just how well we do, and to inspire parents, teachers and students to speak up, start talking about the achievements of the system, and how it can move from great – which it is now - to excellent,” she says.

“The competition website www.schooliscool.org.nz is easy to use, has a fantastic search and browse facility, and encourages people to “rave” about the art work and share it on social networks”.

Competition judges are award-winning children’s author and illustrator Gavin Bishop, and Wellington art teacher Gretchen Buwalda.

Schools can upload their competition entries to www.schooliscool.org.nz . The competition will be judged across 10 categories: 1 for early childhood, 1 each for years 1-8, and one for digital entries. Prizes have been sponsored by Edtech and individual winners will each receive an iPod Touch. The three overall winners will receive a set of 5 iPads, or a set of 3 iPads, or a set of 2iPads.

Entries can be either a poster, up to A3 size, or a digital entry (maximum of 2 minutes in length). Entries can be from an individual or a group.

The competition closes on June 30th, with winners announced on July 29th.
