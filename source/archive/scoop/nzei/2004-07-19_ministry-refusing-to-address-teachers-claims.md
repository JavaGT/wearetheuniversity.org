NZEI Disappointed Ministry Refusing To Address Teachers Claims

“NZEI Te Riu Roa is extremely disappointed at the lack of progress in its negotiation of collective employment agreements for teachers and principals working in primary, intermediate and area schools,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.

NZEI presented its claims to the Ministry on June 10, and negotiations began on June 30. This week the parties completed three more days of formal talks.

“The lack of progress in the negotiations is due to the Ministry of Education’s refusal to engage in a meaningful way on the union’s claims for improvements in the pay and working conditions of NZEI teachers and principals,” say Colin Tarr.

“NZEI is frustrated that the Ministry is insisting on dealing with the union’s major claims, on issues like providing non contact time to help ease teacher’s excessive workload, in a process outside the negotiations.”

“The union says these issues have to be addressed now at the negotiating table,” says Colin Tarr.

NZEI’s major claims: Extra staffing resources to provide NZEI teachers with non contact time to carry out work such as planning and assessment. Fair reward for experienced NZEI teachers and recognition of the qualifications held by NZEI teachers. Changing the salary unit allocation formula for primary, intermediate and area schools to bring it into line with secondary schools. Units are annual payments teachers get for carrying out extra responsibilities Extra support for beginning teachers including a two year write off on interest on their student loans.

“NZEI will now be reporting the lack of progress in the negotiations to teachers and principals and discussing what they can do to encourage the Ministry to treat their claims more seriously and deal with them at the negotiating table,” says Colin Tarr.
