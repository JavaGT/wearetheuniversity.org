Desperate ACT over Charter Schools
==================================

Immediate Release

Desperate ACT over Charter Schools

John Banks' announcement of members of an authorisation body for charter schools today, before Parliament had even passed legislation permitting the schools, is an act of desperation, the education union NZEI Te Riu Roa says.

Parliament's Education and Science Select Committee is currently considering a bill that would establish charter schools, the "cuppa tea" policy announced between the Prime Minister and John Banks after the 2011 election.

National Secretary Paul Goulter says the Committee had heard overwhelmingly from submitters that there was no evidence that charter schools would lift student achievement, that permitting unqualified teachers in charter schools was a risk to students and that New Zealand already had one of most diverse and high-achieving school systems in the world.

He called on MPs on the Select Committee to intervene in the process to ensure that Parliament's right to determine the direction of legislation be upheld, rather than rail-roaded by ACT.

"Mr Banks' desperate attempts to get charter schools up and running before the 2014 election is not about improving outcomes for New Zealand children. It's a cynical attempt to bolster a failing political party by trying to deliver on a policy that is not wanted, not needed and puts our children's education at risk.”
