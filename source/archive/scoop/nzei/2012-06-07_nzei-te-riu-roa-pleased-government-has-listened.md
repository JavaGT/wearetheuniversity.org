For Immediate Release

  
**NZEI Te Riu Roa pleased Government has listened to parents**

NZEI Te Riu Roa has welcomed the Government’s backdown over class sizes.

NZEI President, Ian Leckie says he’s delighted that Government has now listened to the overwhelming concern from parents throughout New Zealand.

“Quite clearly New Zealanders were not prepared to accept the unacceptably high cost that bigger class sizes would have inflicted on our children’s education.

“This now provides certainty for schools next year and ensures the continuation of current class sizes and the technical/arts subjects which are so important for years 7-8.”

“We sincerely hope we can put this episode behind us and would ask the Minister to work collaboratively with the education sector to sustain and continually improve the quality of teaching and the achievement of students.”

NZEI Te Riu Roa commits to taking part in that process.
