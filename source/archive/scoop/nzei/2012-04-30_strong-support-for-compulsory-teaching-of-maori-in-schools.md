Strong Support for Compulsory Teaching of Maori in Schools
==========================================================

**Strong Support for Compulsory Teaching of Maori in Schools**  
   
The education sector union, NZEI Te Riu Roa strongly supports the call for compulsory teaching of Maori in New Zealand schools.  
   
NZEI National President, Ian Leckie says the organization agrees with the Trade Minister Tim Groser who says every five year old in New Zealand should be taught Maori.  
   
Mr Leckie says it has been a long-held view of NZEI Te Riu Roa that all New Zealand children should have the right to learn Te Reo.  
   
“Maori is an official language of New Zealand and Maori culture is a key part of our heritage so it is very important that all New Zealand children have access to good quality teaching in Te Reo.”  
   
However he says along with any commitment to teach Te Reo to all students, there also needs to be a commitment to resource that.  
   
“Inevitably there would need to be additional resources provide for additional staff and to upskill current teachers.  
   
NZEI Te Riu Roa would welcome discussion with the Government over how to make progress in this area.
