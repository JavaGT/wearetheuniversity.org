**NZEI welcomes special education needs Inquiry**

NZEI is welcoming the announcement of an Education and Science Select Committee Inquiry into support for students with dyslexic, dyspraxic, and autism spectrum disorders.

National President, Louise Green says there is a chronic shortage of support for students with special needs and schools struggle to find the resources to help these students succeed at school.

"There is no targeted funding from the Ministry of Education to support students with dyslexia and dyspraxia.

"This means that most schools fund extra teacher aides and other support needed from their Special Education Grants and through fund raising.

"The Special Education Grant is insufficient in most cases to meet the needs of these students and that's why schools have to raise funds locally.

She says teachers, principals and support staff desperately need extra support for these children.

“We need more resources for professional development for teachers as well as extra funding for more teacher aides and other help such as specialised programmes.”
