Primary Teachers Begin National Meetings Over Education

Immediate Release

**Primary Teachers Begin National Meetings Over Education**

Thousands of primary teachers are to begin two weeks of meetings around the country to discuss the Government’s education agenda.

NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie says there is very real concern that the Government’s policies will damage our quality public education system.

He says these issues are being raised by teachers as part of their current collective agreement talks with the Ministry of Education.

“The Ministry has made an offer which we believe is linked to a business model of education driven by cost-cutting and competition.

“What’s at stake here is our world–renowned public education system based on equity and providing good education for all children.”

He says the Government’s policies are based on an agenda known as the Global Education Reform Movement (GERM) which has already failed to improve students learning in other countries. The ideologically-driven policies are based around competition, data-based accountability, standardization and supposed choice.

“We’re seeing GERM creeping into our education system here through National Standards, league tables and charter schools and proposals of performance pay for teachers.

“These offers are not just an attack on teachers but the whole of our education system as we know it. “

As well as meetings throughout the country, there will be a series of larger gatherings in the main centres. They are 12 November - Dunedin, 14 November - Auckland, and 20 November in Wellington and Hamilton.
