**No surprise Kiwis are losing trust in Government’s education agenda**

NZEI Te Riu Roa says it’s not surprising that recent polls have shown that an increasing number of New Zealanders distrust the Government’s education agenda.

National President Ian Leckie says there is very good reason for parents to be worried about the future of education in this country under current policies. He said NZEI members would be consulting with parents in schools this term about their views of the Government’s education policies. It was important parents were informed and understood about the potential impacts on children’s learning of policies such as National Standards league tables, performance pay for teachers and the introduction of charter schools.

Mr Leckie says the Government may have backtracked on bigger class sizes but the other policies were equally damaging and would lead to a further widening of educational inequality for children in this country.

“Publishing league tables based on “ropey” National Standards will do nothing to lift student achievement but will be extremely damaging for many schools and children – especially those who are struggling – by labeling them unfairly as failing,” he says.

“Performance pay for teachers based on student achievement is another unfair policy which will have an especially detrimental impact on schools, students and teachers in poorer communities.” He said a recent OECD study showed no link between performance pay and improved student outcomes.

“National standards are already leading to a narrowing of the curriculum and a loss of the individual creative learning approach that has put New Zealand’s education system near the top of the world in educational achievement.”

“The setting up of experimental Charter schools because of a coalition deal with the Act party means that taxpayers may end up funding schools that operate outside the education system and are run by profit-driven organisations or religious groups such as the Destiny Church.”

“Under the legislation, Charter schools may not need to follow the National Curriculum or even employ qualified or registered teachers.”

Mr Leckie says that New Zealanders want a fair society where all children have an opportunity to achieve to the best of their ability. Setting up schools to compete with each other and removing collaboration between teachers will destroy our quality education system.

He says rather than creating winner and loser schools, more resources targeted to those students who are struggling would make a big difference in lifting student achievement. More investment in quality early childhood education was also crucial.

“We need to lift our overall investment in children and their learning and fund the programmes we know work. This means targeting more resources into things such as Reading Recovery, skilled teacher aides, better access for specialist help for children with special needs and more access to health professionals in schools.”

“The Government needs to ensure that New Zealand remains near the top of the OECD in educational achievement by enhancing and building on what we know works, and not experimenting with ideological policies that have already failed overseas.”
