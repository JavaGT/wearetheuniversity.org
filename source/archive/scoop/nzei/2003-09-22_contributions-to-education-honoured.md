Contributions To Education Honoured

WELLINGTON –A group of outstanding educationalists, teachers, principals and school administrators were today honoured by the country’s largest education union.

The awards were presented by the country’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, which has 42,000 members. It represents teachers and principals in primary schools, teachers in early childhood education centres, support staff in primary and secondary schools, special education staff in primary and secondary schools and advisers in the tertiary sector.

They were presented by Bruce Adin, NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, at the opening of the union’s 120th Annual Meeting in Wellington.

Sixteen members of the union were honoured along with three distinguished members of the education community.

Bruce Kelly, a former principal of Karori Normal School, and former NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, was given the union’s highest honour, Life Membership.

Bruce Kelly has played a huge role in raising the professional status of teachers during his time as National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa, from 1975-76, and as a National Executive Member in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.

“He is a visionary who fought to enhance the professional status of primary teachers for many years. We have seen his ideas culminate in the establishment of the New Zealand Teachers Council,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.

Dr Jocelyn Jesson, the director of research development at the Auckland College of Education, Iritana Tawhiwhirangi, the former Chief Executive of the Kohanga Reo Trust, and Professor Timoti Karetu, a former Maori Language Commissioner, were made Honorary Fellows of NZEI Te Riu Roa.
