Day of Action - Teachers and principals call for a better plan

4 September 2014

Teachers, principals, school support staff as well as parents will send a clear message to the government tomorrow (Friday 5 Sept) to put education funding where it will directly benefit kids.

All around the country, school communities will be meeting outside MPs offices to deliver letters asking for cross party support for education initiatives that will target the real needs of children.

"Primary teachers and principals have voted overwhelmingly to reject the government's controversial plan to spend $359m on a new management framework that will not directly benefit children's education," says NZEI National President Judith Nowotarski.

"We have a much better plan and we want the government to spend the money where it's really needed - to improve student learning rather than imposing a top-down, one size fits all model on schools."

"Tomorrow will be a Day of Action. All around the country, teachers, support staff and parents will be gathering at MP offices before school in the hope of getting support for a better plan for kids."

Groups will be visiting MPs offices in most towns across the country on Friday, 5 September at 7:30 am.

Events will be held nationwide - follow this link for details of events at your local MP's office
