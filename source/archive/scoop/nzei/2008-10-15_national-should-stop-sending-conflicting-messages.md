National Should Stop Sending Conflicting Messages

National Party Spokespeople Need To Get On The Same Page

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa is calling on the National Party to stop sending conflicting messages and get its spokespeople singing from the same song sheet.

In a video on YouTube, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir2anqvJ-Dc it is clear the party is confused about whether teachers and education workers would be exempt from its proposed 90 Day trial policy.

On the one hand education spokesperson Anne Tolley says the policy is not intended to apply to teachers, while on the other, industrial relations spokesperson Kate Wilkinson insists it will cover any workplace of less than 20 people.

It is time the party came clean on its intentions. There are thousands of schools and early childhood centres with less than 20 workers and the policy could have profound implications on professional and career development, and exacerbate teacher supply and shortage issues.

NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter says the National Party is obviously confused over how it intends to apply the 90 Day policy. “It should get its story straight and get its spokespeople on the same page,” he says.
