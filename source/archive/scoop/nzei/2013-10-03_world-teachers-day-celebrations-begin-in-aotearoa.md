Immediate Release

World Teachers’ Day celebrations begin in Aotearoa/New Zealand

The global celebrations for World Teachers’ Day (5 October) will begin at dawn with a ceremony and powhiri in Gisborne – the first place in the world to see the sun.

Principals, teachers and support staff, parents and kids will gather on the beach to mark the start of the day and a year of events to celebrate quality teaching and learning.

Gisborne’s Mayor, Meng Foon will speak at the celebration along with local kaumatua and educators.

NZEI National President Judith Nowotarski says it’s important that October the 5th is a celebration of quality teaching and learning.

As part of the celebrations, a “tokotoko” or talking stick to symbolise the passing on of stories, knowledge and learning left Aotearoa for New York earlier in the week for the launch of a Year of Action for education.

The tototoko was presented to Education International President Susan Hopgood at the NZEI Te Riu Roa Annual Conference in Rotorua.

With its design representing the four winds – peoples from the four corners of the earth – the tokotoko reinforces the message that sharing the values and successes of quality public education is critically important.

International celebrations will be marked by Education International (EI – the global union federation that represents education professionals worldwide) and other education unions around the world launching the Year of Action in New York and Paris.

Celebrations will also be visible online where students and parents will have an opportunity to go online and thank a teacher.

World Teachers’ Day, held annually on 5 October since 1994, aims to mobilise support for teachers and to ensure that the needs of future generations will continue to be met by teachers.
