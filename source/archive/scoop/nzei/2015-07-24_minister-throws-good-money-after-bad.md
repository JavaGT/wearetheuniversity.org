Minister throws good money after bad

24 July 2015

NZEI Te Riu Roa is appalled that the Whangaruru charter school has the green light to continue operating and even been given up to $129,000 to implement its remedial plan.

NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter said Minister Parata’s argument that closure would be detrimental to the school’s “vulnerable” students was astounding.

“These kids need a school with solid leadership and quality teaching. Who knows if Whangaruru will ever be able to offer that? In the meantime, the students are the guinea pigs in this ideological experiment that the government obviously thinks is too important to be allowed to fail,” said Mr Goulter.
