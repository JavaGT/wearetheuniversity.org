**Education leaders gather in Rotorua**

25 September 2015

More than 350 leaders in education will descend on the Rotorua Convention Centre for the NZEI Te Riu Roa Annual Conference from 28-30 September.

The theme of the conference is _It's Got To Be About The Child,_ emphasising the importance of putting the best interests of children and their learning at the centre of any education system changes.

Vigorous discussion and debate are expected following a tumultuous 12 months in education, including the introduction of the Education Council, freezing of early childhood education funding, and developments in the NZEI-Ministry Joint Initiative.

Media are welcome to attend the conference, which will include keynote addresses from CTU President Helen Kelly, Professor Bob Lingard of The University of Queensland, Federal President of the Australian Education Union Correna Haythorpe, and Angelo Gavrielatos, who is a Senior Consultant to the General Secretary at Education International.

ENDS
