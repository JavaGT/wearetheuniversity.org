Successful Settlement of Primary Teacher Pay Claim

NZEI Te Riu Roa has successfully negotiated a fair pay settlement for thousands of primary and intermediate school teachers, which recognises the importance of middle and senior leadership in schools.

NZEI, which represents 27,000 primary teachers, has been in negotiations with the Ministry of Education over their collective agreement since August.

It welcomes the settlement and acknowledges the efforts which have gone in to achieve a positive outcome.

It says the settlement of the pay claim will help address a number of issues such as teacher retention and supply, and will provide better resourcing in the primary sector.

NZEI National President Irene Cooper says “NZEI appreciates the recognition of the need to resource middle and senior leadership so teachers can support programmes and initiatives which support quality learning for all students. “

Details of the settlement will be sent to members next week and the agreement will then be put to them at the start of the new school year. NZEI will be recommending full ratification.
