**Hands up for Learning!**

Thousands of children throughout the country will be putting their hands up for learning today as part of World Teachers Day celebrations. (Oct 30)

World Teachers Day events are happening in schools, kindergartens and early childhood centres with plans for a nationwide “Hands Up for Learning”. In a number of areas, MPs will be joining in the celebrations.

Larger activities are planned in several places.

In Dunedin, a large group of children from MacAndrew Intermediate will be in the Octagon where they will put their hands up for three minutes when the clock chimes at midday.

In Christchurch hundreds of people, including a number of politicians will be at Aorangi Primary for a mass “Hands Up” at 12.30pm.

In Wellington children at the Adelaide Childcare Centre will host three local MPs in a “Hands Up for Learning” at 12.30, while children at Khandallah School will be holding a Hands Up jump-off outside at lunchtime.

Another mass “Hands Up” is planned at Palmerston North Normal Intermediate at lunchtime.

In Auckland, children from St Joseph’s School in Onehunga are holding World Teacher Day activities in a vacant shop in the Onehunga Mall from 11am. Then at 1.30pm all the school’s 280 students will line up along Church St outside the school, and put their hands up, along with cardboard letters spelling out Hands Up for Learning.

The education sector union which represents thousands of principals and teachers in primary and intermediate schools, kindergarten and early childhood centres, says the celebrations are a great way to recognise the value of teaching and learning in the community.
