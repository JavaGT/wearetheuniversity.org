Pay Rise For Early Childhood Sector
===================================

For Immediate Release

New Agreement Will Deliver Pay Rise To Early Childhood Sector

More than a thousand early childhood teachers and staff will receive a pay rise next year following the settlement and ratification of their collective agreement.

The Early Childhood Education Collective Agreement provides the benchmark for teaching standards and conditions in early childhood centres and services around the country. It is negotiated by the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa and Te Tari Puna Ora o Aotearoa - the New Zealand Childcare Association, which represents employers. It is one of the largest multi-employer agreements in New Zealand, involving 145 employers who operate early childhood services.

The agreement runs for two years and those covered by it will receive up to a 4% increase in the first year, and another 4% in the second year.

NZEI National Executive member Hayley Whitaker says one of the key issues for early childhood teachers is pay parity with kindergarten and primary.

“This agreement demonstrates a commitment from all parties to continue working towards parity. These employers are clearly committed to ensuring their staff are valued as professionals and to providing quality education for children,” she says.

The pay rises will take effect from July 1, 2010.
