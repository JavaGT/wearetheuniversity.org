NZEI Supports Greater Protection For Foreign Students

Wellington – NZEI Te Riu Roa has endorsed moves to provide stronger protection for foreign fee paying students attending primary and intermediate schools.

The Minister has announced that the “The Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students will be strengthened. Under the changes any international student aged 10 or under (Years 1-6) live with a parent or legal guardian, while providers enrolling international students aged 11 - 13 (Years 7 and 8) living without a parent or legal guardian will be required to seek ‘prior programme approval’ from the Code Administrator (Ministry of Education).

“I’d like to commend the Minister of Education for these changes. The NZEI position has always been driven by the need to have measures in place that protect foreign fee paying students, especially the younger primary age children,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Bruce Adin.

“Having the requirement that the primary age children from overseas live with parents or a legal guardian while going to school here is a sensible one. If that means that some schools may lose funding that is not as significant as ensuring adequate provision is made for these young students.”

“NZEI also supports the requirement that intermediate age children are allowed here without a parent or legal guardian only if they are enrolled at a school or programme that has been approved by the Ministry of Education, provided the Ministry carries out its responsibilities with a firm hand.”

“There is considerable merit in New Zealand and foreign students mixing and sharing experiences as we live in a global world.”

“These initiatives by the Minister should ensure that global contact can continue but not at the expense of the care and protection of the foreign students especially those of primary school age,” says Bruce Adin.
