The Devil in the Detail of National's Compulsory Testing Policy

"It's essential the compulsory testing of primary school students proposed by National does not develop into the standardized testing and school league tables that have proved disastrous overseas," says Irene Cooper, National President of the New Zealand Educational Institute, which represents primary teachers and principals.

National Party leader, John Key announced today that, if in government, his party would make all primary schools test their students in reading, writing and maths and measure their performance against a national standard. He said each school would test their students using existing assessment tools.

"We're pleased that National proposes using the assessment tools that schools are already using rather than having all students sit a standardized test," says Irene Cooper. "We're also pleased that Mr Key says he has no intention of publishing the test results in school league tables."

The British Government introduced standardised tests and league tables for primary schools in England and Wales in the early 1990s. The Welsh National Assembly scrapped the tests and tables, after it took control of education in Wales in 1999, because of their negative impact on student learning.

"Experience overseas shows that standardised testing turns children off education. Their schooling is reduced to sitting tests and they become bored and disruptive," says Irene Cooper.  
She says standardized testing and league create huge stress for children because they're under enormous pressure to pass the tests so their school avoids being ranked as a failing school.  
"It's vital that New Zealand avoid the destructive standardized testing and the ranking of schools that has occurred in England and parts of the United States," says Irene Cooper.

"It's encouraging to see that Mr Key has recognised that we already have world class assessment tools, that not only enable schools to assessx students performance in reading, writing and maths, but also help them improve that performance."

"The fact is schools are already doing the things that Mr Key is calling for but too often can't get the resources they need to provide the extra assistance for the students who are struggling."

Irene Cooper says primary teachers and principals hope that Mr Key is proposing building on the current assessment system and providing the resources needed to make it even better.

"The devil will be in the detail of National's education policy and how it's implemented," says Irene Cooper. "If it leads to standardized testing and the development of school league tables then our children and the country will pay the price."
