NZEI Welcomes New CEO Of The Teachers Council

New Zealand’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, has welcomed the appointment of Peter Lind as Director and CEO of the Teachers Council.

“We look forward to working with Mr Lind and other recently appointed senior staff at the Teachers Council,” NZEI Te RIU ROA President Colin Tarr said.

Mr Tarr said Mr Lind’s previous experience as a teacher and principal and his current role as Director of Teacher Education at Massey University meant he had a sound understanding of the education sector.

“These recent appointments mean the Council is now well-placed to increase its profile and interaction with teachers on professional issues. Implementation of the Council’s new code of ethics and the debate about professional and ethical issues that that will promote will also be a significant issue for NZEI members,” Mr Tarr said.
