Hamilton School Principal Re-Elected

Hamilton primary school principal, Irene Cooper, has been re-elected National President of the country’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa.

She was re elected on the final day of the union’s Annual Meeting in Wellington which was attended by 400 members.

The union has 45,000 members working in every education sector. They are teachers and principals in primary schools, early childhood teachers, support staff and special education staff in primary and secondary schools, plus early childhood education services, and school advisers and lecturers in education faculties at universities and Colleges of Education.

Irene Cooper was first elected National President 12 months ago at last year’s Annual Meeting. She is on leave during her presidency from her job as principal of Hillcrest Normal School in Hamilton.

She qualified as a primary teacher in England and began her teaching career in New Zealand in 1972. She spent several years as a full time reliever before getting her first permanent teaching job at Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Te Ara Rima in Hamilton. She was appointed deputy principal at Gordonton School near Hamilton in 1991 and then Assistant Principal at Knighton Normal School, in Hamilton, in 1994. She became principal at Hillcrest Normal School in 1996.

Irene Cooper has a Masters of Education Leadership with honours, a Bachelor of Education and a Diploma of Teaching.
