NO MAGIC BULLET FOR RAISING MAORI EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says National Standards on literacy and numeracy will not provide a magic bullet in raising Maori educational achievement.

The Nga Haeata Matauranga annual report on Maori Education 2007-8 says most schools are struggling to meet the educational needs of Maori students. The Education Minister Anne Tolley has responded by saying that the introduction of National Standards will help lift the overall performance of Maori in the education system.

NZEI says schools already have the assessment tools to measure and identify poorly performing students. The implementation of new National Standards will not make any difference in terms of finding solutions.

NZEI President Frances Nelson says “I am reminded constantly that testing students doesn’t improve their learning, good teaching does. We need to ensure that teachers have the skills, resources and support to make a difference to their students on a daily basis.

“Quality teaching is important and we need to continue to build a strong, capable and motivated teaching workforce. But the solution must focus more widely and include addressing the effects of socio-economic factors, given the report shows 50% of all Maori students attend schools in the poorest communities,” she says.

The Minister has rightly said that a strong and concerted effort from everyone responsible for Maori education is what’s needed, and they must all work together to make a difference.

There are successful interventions and initiatives which are making a difference. The Te Kotahitanga and Ka Hikitia programmes take a holistic approach, with teachers and schools sharing the responsibility for learning with whanau, communities and other agencies. These types of initiatives must continue to be built on to engage Maori students and allow them to reach their full potential.
