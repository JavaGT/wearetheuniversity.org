Literacy Results Prove Worth Of Professional Teacher Development Programmes

NZEI Te Riu Roa is delighted by the results of the Literacy Professional Development Project, saying they prove that professional development for teachers pays off.

The project aims to improve student achievement by providing schools with a professional development programme for staff. It involves a professional development facilitator going into each school to teach the teachers how best to use the tools proven to be most effective in raising literacy skills.

It began in 2004 and the latest evaluation has shown marked improvement in reading and writing for students in schools taking part. Most notably it showed significant improvement among the bottom 20% of students, who began catching up to the average level of achievement, making double the progress of other students.

NZEI National President Frances Nelson says the level of improvement and the success of the project show what a difference investing in professional development for teachers can make to children's learning.

Giving teachers time to work together with colleagues in their own school to improve achievement levels is worthwhile for both staff and students. These results give the education sector some solid evidence that professional development is vital and should be encouraged.

NZEI is pleased the project is continuing and that more schools and teachers will have the opportunity to take part.
