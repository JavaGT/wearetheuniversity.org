Time to recognise those who support teaching and learning

Pink balloons, flouro t-shirts, candles, cakes, forums, lunches, dinners, and MP visits will all feature as schools and communities celebrate Support Staff Day this Wednesday (15th June).

Over 21,000 support staff are currently employed in New Zealand’s 2,477 state and integrated schools and many teachers and principals describe them as the glue that keeps schools together.

This predominantly female support staff workforce has grown an estimated 25 per cent in the past ten years and now makes up a third of staff in most schools.

Support staff include teacher aides, therapists, library and IT staff, science and sports co-ordinators and other workers who support the efficient running of schools. While they are essential to the support of children’s learning and the day to day management of schools they are one of the lowest paid work groups in the country, often earning just $14 an hour.

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says a major focus of Support Staff Day will also be convincing the government that support staff wages should be centrally funded – as teachers are – rather than bulk-funded through the school operations grant.

NZEI President Ian Leckie says the contribution support staff make is easily recognised by parents and students all over the country.

“We don’t want funding issues to hinder the very important work they do. We not only want a fair deal, but a fairer deal for them - whether they’re in the office, the library, the classroom or any other area.”
