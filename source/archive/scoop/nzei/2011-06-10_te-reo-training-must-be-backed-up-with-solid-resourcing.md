For Immediate Release

Compulsory te reo training for teachers must be backed up with solid resourcing

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says teachers will need effective resources and ongoing professional development to make compulsory te reo training count.

New rules will require teachers to study tikanga Māori and te reo during their initial teacher education and at school. The cultural competency programme will be introduced later this year and be in every school by the end of 2012.

NZEI says it is good to see te reo competency being recognised as a core part of a teacher’s role. It also recognises that having a teaching workforce with a more in-depth knowledge of te reo and tikanga Māori has a big impact on Māori student motivation and achievement.

“We know that Māori student outcomes improve when teachers are familiar with kaupapa Māori and students feel understood and valued. It’s an essential element if we’re serious about lifting achievement and the system as a whole would benefit,” says NZEI President Ian Leckie.

“What teachers and schools will need however is solid resourcing and ongoing professional development . It’s important that any training in te reo and tikanga Māori is backed up by regular opportunities for teachers to enhance their knowledge and skills in the classroom.”

Mr Leckie says it will also pose challenges for teacher education institutions as there is a shortage of fluent te reo teachers generally.

“We would call on the government to provide more details on exactly how the programme would work in practice and just how cultural competency would be measured,” he says.
