Draft Curriculum Gives Schools More Freedom

NZEI Te Riu Roa welcomes the draft version of the revised curriculum released today as it gives schools more freedom to tailor their teaching to the needs of their students.

Education Minister Steve Maharey launched the draft curriculum at Karori Normal School in Wellington today. It represents a major streamlining of the curriculum with one document covering what is currently included in seven separate curriculum statements.

“The current curriculum has become too complex and unwieldy with the addition of more and more components over the years,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Irene Cooper. “The draft curriculum appears to be more user friendly for teachers.”

“But its chief advantage is that it provides principals, teachers and school boards more freedom to determine the most effective way to teach the curriculum.”

“Schools will still be required to teach core skills, such as numeracy and literacy, but will be able to do so in a way that recognises the community in which its students live.”

“This should help make the lessons more relevant and the information easier for students to absorb.”

Every primary and secondary teacher is receiving a copy of the draft curriculum. They’re being asked to evaluate the document and provide feedback to the Ministry of Education by the end of November. This will be analysed and used to write the final version of the revised curriculum, which is due to be introduced into schools in September next year.

“The improvements coming through in the draft curriculum reflects the fact that teachers and principals have been involved in its development,” says Irene Cooper.

“It’s good to see that this consultation is continuing and that every teacher and principal is being given the opportunity to have their say in the shape of the final version of the curriculum.”
