Minister shows contempt for Christchurch teachers and staff
===========================================================

**Minister shows contempt for Christchurch teachers and school support staff**

NZEI Te Riu Roa says the Minister of Education, Hekia Parata has shown a total disregard for teachers and school support staff in today’s announcement confirming the closure of four schools in Christchurch.

NZEI Waitaha-Canterbury Chair Sandra Spekreijse says the Government’s decision means that all staff at those schools will face three years of uncertainty over their jobs.

“The Minister is showing utter contempt for Christchurch teachers and school support staff. These are people who have shown extraordinary dedication for more than two years to provide Christchurch children with a secure learning environment in extremely trying times."

The closure means that 33 teachers from Aranui Primary, Avondale School and Wainoni School will lose their current jobs while 29 Christchurch support staff from those schools as well as Aranui High School also face the prospect of job losses.

“We are very concerned about the effect this uncertainty will have on children at those schools. It will add to further unnecessary disruption for those children.

“It seems extraordinary that the Minister did not agree to a merger of the schools as she did in the case of the New Brighton Schools, rather than continuing to opt for closure.

“Merger would have given staff the certainty they deserve and consequently children would have benefitted from less disruption.”

“We would have to question why she has made this unnecessary and uncaring decision as it does not make any real economic sense.

“The Ministry of Education has given schools an open cheque book for counselling for staff yet is unable to give teachers and school support staff proper certainty about their future.”
