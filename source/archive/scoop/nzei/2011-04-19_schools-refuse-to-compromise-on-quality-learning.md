Schools Refuse to Compromise on Quality Learning

**Schools Refuse to Compromise on Quality Learning**

The government must take notice of a new survey that shows around one-third of schools, or some 600, will not comply with requirements to set achievement targets against National Standards.

The survey was conducted by the Boards Taking Action Coalition, and found that 29.7% of respondents to the survey were planning to defy the first major requirement of the legislation that was passed under urgency in 2008. A further 26.4% said they would take a position of minimal compliance. Only 43.9% said they would submit standards targets.

“From our discussions with members, we know that schools that do not comply will only take this step after serious reflection and widespread consultation with school communities,” says NZEI president Ian Leckie.

“Educators see their first duty as being to students and their learning – they know that National Standards is a very flawed policy that threatens to undermine a high-performing education system.

“Under this policy, too many students are being labelled as failures; too many parents are receiving false information about their children’s achievements. National Standards subsume the uniqueness of each child’s learning into an inappropriate one-size-fits-all programme.

“The charade has to stop somewhere, and it is regrettable that it has had to go on for so long, and come to this point.”

Mr Leckie is urging the Minister of Education to meet with representatives of the sector, and to engage in a meaningful way to redevelop the policy so that it is educationally sound.

“Our teachers are ambitious to make our great system even better through continual improvement, but this flawed policy is now actively getting in the way.

ENDS
