Primary Teachers To vote On Claim
=================================

**Press Release: [NZEI](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI)**

Media Release  
Sunday May 6 2007  
From NZEI Te Riu Roa  
              For Immediate Use

 Primary Teachers To vote On Claim To Support New career Structure  
                                                                   

Primary teachers will tomorrow begin voting on proposals to implement a new career structure that would encourage and reward experienced teachers to stay in the classroom.

The new structure is a key feature of the teachers’ proposed claim going in to their collective employment agreement negotiations later this year.

  
Around 25,000 primary teachers in 2000 schools have been invited to vote on the proposals at 118 meetings around New Zealand organised by their union, NZEI Te Riu Roa.  The meetings will run from Monday May 7 until Friday May 25. (1)

The proposed model, developed by NZEI, the Ministry of Education and the School Trustees Association, is designed to address the loss of many good teachers after five years in the job.  Teachers leave because of the perceived lack of career opportunities in primary teaching and the capping of salaries of experienced teachers who choose not to move into management. 

The model creates new roles known as Advanced Skills Teachers,  Mentor Teachers and Middle and Senior Leadership positions.  Teachers would have to demonstrate to independent “attesters” that they had the skills, knowledge and attributes to take on these positions.

NZEI’s claim aims to support the introduction of the new career pathway by proposing enhanced pay for these new roles, providing additional time for teachers to do their work, ensuring support is available for new teachers and promoting a nationally consistent career path.

“It’s important teachers take the time to consider the claim over the next few weeks, and get it right,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa President Irene Cooper. “The proposed new career pathway is the most significant change in their collective agreement for many years.   If we can keep great teachers in the classroom and enhance their working conditions, we will have a direct impact on improving the learning of the 440,000 children enrolled in our primary schools. ”

Another key claim being voted on is a proposed 4% pay increase in basic pay for primary teachers on July 1 this year, with a further 4% in each of the next two subsequent years.

Notes:

(1)     Paid Union Meetings

Under the Employment Relations Act 2000 every union member in the country is entitled to attend two paid union meetings a year, during work time, to discuss important issues. Most of the two hour meetings start at 1.30pm to ensure a maximum number of primary teachers can attend, while minimising disruption to students and their families.  All boards of trustees and principals have been given advance notice, so arrangements could be made to cater for students during the meetings.

A full list of the primary teachers paid union meetings is issued with this release and is also available at www.nzei.org.nz
