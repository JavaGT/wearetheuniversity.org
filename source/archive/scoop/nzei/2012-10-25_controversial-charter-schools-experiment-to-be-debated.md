Controversial Charter Schools Experiment To Be Debated
======================================================

Immediate Release

  
**Controversial Charter Schools Experiment To Be Debated**  
  
NZEI Te Riu Roa believes charter schools are an unnecessary and dangerous experiment which will not help children and their learning.

A debate on controversial charter schools will take place in Christchurch on Monday, 29 October.

NZEI Te Riu Roa believes that Christchurch is being used as a template for the charter schools experiment which has failed internationally.

One of the speakers, NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter will talk about the experience of charter schools, particularly in Canada, the United States and Europe.

“There has never been a shred of evidence internationally that charter schools lift the achievement of disadvantaged groups.

“Evidence we have, suggests the opposite. In the United States, special needs students are under-represented in charter school enrolments, and are over-represented in expulsions and attrition figures and 40 percent of Afro American students drop out of KIPP schools (an American charter school chain) by year nine.

“And what do the pro-Charter Schools groups say? They say: ‘why don’t you just give them a go?’”

Amendments to the Education Act to allow for the introduction of charter schools have been introduced to Parliament. Submissions to the Education and Science select committee close on January 24.

Also on the panel will be: Nanaia Mahuta, Labour spokesperson on Education, Jacqui Duncan, Principal of Cashmere Primary School and Catherine Isaac leader of the Charter School Working Group.

The evening will be mc’d by Port Hills Member of Parliament Ruth Dyson.

**Debate on charter schools, Monday, 29 October, Top West Lounge, Woolston Club, Hargood St, Woolston, 7-8.30pm.**
