NZEI RELEASE EMBARGOED 31ST October 2008

Teachers Matter - Celebrate World Teachers Day

"Where would any of us be today without the memory of a teacher or teachers who inspired us, offered us the opportunities to dream and often protected and kept safe the innocence of our childhood? With these great precious gifts the calm became widespread, the winds were warm and the sea ever sparkled across my pathway" - Witi Ihimaera

Teachers Matter and the country's largest education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa is encouraging the public to celebrate the teachers in their communities on World Teachers Day on Friday 31st October.

World Teachers Day was established by UNESCO and is marked in over 100 countries around the world each year.

NZEI represents thousands of teachers in primary and intermediate schools, kindergartens and early childhood centres throughout the country. World Teachers Day is a chance to highlight the value of teachers and acknowledge the contribution they make to the teaching and learning of New Zealand's children.

It is also a time to celebrate quality public education and teaching as a profession.

NZEI has invited well-known New Zealanders such as Robyn Malcolm, Witi Ihimaera, Michael Galvin and Hollie Smith to share their stories about why teachers have mattered to them. Posters carrying their messages can be seen and downloaded at: http://www2.nzei.org.nz/Celebrate+teachers+on+World+Teachers+Day.html

Celebrate teaching and learning and think about why teachers matter to you!
