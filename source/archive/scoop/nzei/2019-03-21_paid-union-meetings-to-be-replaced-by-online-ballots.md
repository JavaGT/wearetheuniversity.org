Paid union meetings to be replaced by online ballots

Paid union meetings to be replaced by online ballots following terrorist attacks  
21 March 2019

Primary teachers and principals will now vote in online ballots about whether to accept the Ministry's latest collective agreement offers, following the cancellation of this week's paid union meetings.

The NZEI Te Riu Roa National Executive decided on Sunday to cancel the meetings as a mark of respect to the 50 people killed in the terrorist attack in Christchurch -- and so members could be in their schools this week to provide continuity and stability for their students.

After discussions with member leaders in Christchurch, the National Executive decided last night to run an electronic ballot from Monday 1 April to Friday 5 April. We think this is the least disruptive way for members to respond to the Ministry's current offers.

Next week's nationwide paid union meetings for Area School teachers have also been cancelled for the same reasons.

Area school teacher members will now hold joint site meetings after school with their PPTA colleagues to discuss and vote on endorsing their claim for upcoming collective agreement negotiations.
