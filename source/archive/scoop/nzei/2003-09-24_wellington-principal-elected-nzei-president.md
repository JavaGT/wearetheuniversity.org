Wellington Principal Elected NZEI President

Wellington primary school principal, Colin Tarr, has today been elected the next National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa, the country’s largest education union.

He was elected unopposed on the final day of the union’s 120th Annual Meeting attended by 400 members in Wellington.

NZEI Te Riu Roa represents 42,000 members who work in all education sectors - early childhood teachers, primary teachers and principals, support staff in primary and secondary schools, special education staff working in primary and secondary schools and advisers in the tertiary sector.

Colin Tarr is currently serving as the Vice President of the union. He will become National President on January 1 next year, taking over from Bruce Adin. Bruce will serve on the National Executive next year as the Immediate Past President

Colin was also the convenor of an NZEI working party that produced a discussion document on the union’s vision of a unified teaching profession, which was adopted by members at the Annual Meeting.

He is the principal of Pukeatua Primary School in the Wellington suburb of Wainuiomata. It has 235 students and 28 staff. He has been a principal at Manurewa East and Northcote Primary schools in Auckland and at Morrinsville Intermediate. Colin has also taught at a secondary school and worked as reviewer for the Education Review Office.

“I joined NZEI on the first morning of my first year at Teachers College 23 years ago and I’ve been actively involved since then,” says Colin Tarr.
