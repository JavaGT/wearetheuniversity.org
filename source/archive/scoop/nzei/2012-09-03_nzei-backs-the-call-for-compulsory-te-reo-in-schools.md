NZEI backs the call for compulsory Te Reo in schools

Immediate Release

**NZEI backs the call for compulsory Te Reo in schools**

  
NZEI Te Riu Roa says it strongly supports the compulsory teaching of Te Reo in all New Zealand primary schools.

This follows the call by the Independent Maori Statutory Board in its 30 year Maori Plan for Tamaki Makaurau for Maori to be taught to all students in Auckland schools.

National President, Ian Leckie says it has been a long-held view of NZEI Te Riu Roa that all New Zealand children should have the right to learn Te Reo.

\"Maori is an official language of New Zealand and Maori culture is a key part of our heritage so it is very important that all New Zealand children have access to good quality teaching in Te Reo."

And he says this needs to be backed by more training for teachers in Te Reo.

“Most schools do their best to teach Te Reo but many are often limited because of a lack of trained Te Reo teachers,” he says.

Earlier this year, Trade Minister Tim Groser also called for the compulsory teaching of Maori in schools in New Zealand.

NZEI Te Riu Roa would welcome discussion with the Government over how to make progress in this area."
