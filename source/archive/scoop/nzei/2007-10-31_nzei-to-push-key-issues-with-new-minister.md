NZEI To Push Key Issues With New Minister

The education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, welcomes the appointment of Chris Carter as the new Minister of Education, following today's Cabinet reshuffle, and looks forward to working with him to progress a number of key issues in the sector.

Mr Carter has a solid background in education after a long career as a teacher and has been a hard-working and effective member of the Labour-led government.

NZEI, which represents 46,000 early childhood, kindergarten, primary and intermediate teachers, school advisors and school support staff, is committed to quality public education, and believes Mr Carter shares that commitment.

NZEI National President Irene Cooper says \"we look forward to a constructive relationship with the new Minister. There are several key issues we would like to see some clear progress and decision making on, such as teacher supply and retention, significantly more operational funding for schools, along with better pay and job security for school support staff, and ensuring the early childhood strategic plan remains on target. We also hope he will support financial recognition for middle and senior leadership positions in primary schools and a successful outcome for primary teachers in their current pay claim negotiations."

NZEI would also like to acknowledge the work of the outgoing Minister Steve Maharey.

"We had a very constructive working relationship with Mr Maharey during his two years in office. He had a firm grasp of current issues across the sector and a coherent vision for the future direction of schooling. He made a positive difference to early childhood education through the introduction of the 20-hours free policy and made good on the policy of reducing Year One class sizes," Ms Cooper says.

NZEI wishes Mr Maharey all the best when he takes up his new role as Vice Chancellor of Massey University.

ENDS
