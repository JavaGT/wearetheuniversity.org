Massey Decision – a Case of the Tail Wagging the Dog
====================================================

**Massey Decision – a Case of the Tail Wagging the Dog**  
   
Massey University is putting its own financial needs ahead of the needs of the education sector following its decision to scrap all undergraduate teacher education.  
   
The University has just announced that it is cutting its three-year Bachelor of Education Early Years degree and the four-year bachelor of Education Primary.  
   
NZEI Te Riu Roa opposed the move last year when it was first discussed.  The organisation’s site representative at Massey University, Sarah Thomas says clearly the education sector has not been listened to.  
   
“The university is doing what is best for itself, and is not acting in the best interests of the education sector or in the interests of quality education.”  
   
Ms Thomas says this will erode the choice and quality of teacher training.  For many students, the best option is the full undergraduate study course. The only option now open to trainee teachers will be a one-year, graduate diploma.  
   
“That simply does not suit everyone.  Some students don’t respond well to the pressure-cooker one-year approach.”  
   
“It will mean students will be pushed through the training and out into the real world before they have gained enough experience to fully prepare them for the demands of the classroom situation and this will have a significant impact on teaching quality.”  
   
“We are not saying that one course is better than the other, simply that Massey will not be providing another option. And this must have an impact on the overall quality of teacher training.”  
   
Ms Thomas says the decision is based more on fiscal concerns than on teacher quality.  
   
“The decision was made largely because of the Government’s reduction in undergraduate funding and the need to secure Performance Based Research Funding.”
