NZEI backs calls for action on child poverty

20 May 2015

  
NZEI Te Riu Roa is backing the thousands of New Zealanders calling for tomorrow’s Budget to end child poverty in New Zealand.

“Poverty is by far the biggest indicator and cause of children not succeeding in education”, says NZEI National President Louise Green.

“That’s why our leaders will be at Parliament today as part of a delegation to present the Action Station petition calling for real action to end child poverty in tomorrow’s Budget.”

“Teachers, principals and school support staff see the impact of child poverty every day. They see first-hand the effects of children living in cold, damp, overcrowded houses, and how transience, lack of food in the fridge and inadequate medical care affects their education.

“Poverty is a major problem that is preventing thousands of children from achieving success in education.

“This Budget is a real opportunity to address the incomes and living conditions of our poorest families. By doing so, our government would be making a meaningful investment in lifting their children’s educational achievement.”
