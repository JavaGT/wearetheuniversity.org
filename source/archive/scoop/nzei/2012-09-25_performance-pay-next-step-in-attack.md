Performance Pay - next step in attack
=====================================

Immediate Release

**Performance Pay - next step in attack on quality public education**

  
NZEI Te Riu Roa says the Education Minister Hekia Parata needs to come clean over the Government’s real agenda for education.

“It is most disturbing that two days after the publication of inaccurate and ‘ropey’ National Standards, the Minister is now saying that National Standards could be used as a tool in assessing the performance of teachers,” says NZEI National Secretary, Paul Goulter.

“This is yet another indication of the Government’s real education agenda – one that runs completely counter to international best practice.”

“For instance, a recent OECD report on performance pay for teachers found that there is no relationship between student achievement and the use of performance-based pay schemes.

“It is very clear that the development of narrow and misleading National Standards and league tables is setting the stage for a system of performance pay for teachers.”

“Clearly this is part of a full frontal attack on our curriculum, our quality public education system and our teachers.”

“The Government needs to address issues such as child poverty and our widening inequality gap instead of conveniently blaming teachers for student under-achievement.”

“Instead of setting up students and schools for failure, the Government needs to ensure that every child goes to a good school and gets a good education.”
