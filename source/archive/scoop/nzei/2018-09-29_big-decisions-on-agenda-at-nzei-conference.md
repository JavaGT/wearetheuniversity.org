**Big decisions on agenda at NZEI conference**

**29 September 2018**

Two major announcements are planned at the NZEI Te Riu Roa conference on Monday October 1.

The 135th Annual Conference of the NZEI Te Riu Roa will take place from Sept 30 until October 3 in Rotorua.

This year it focuses on three large campaigns - Kua tae te wā - It's Time, Mana Taurite - Pay Equity, and the 30 Year Vision for Education. See the programme here.

There will be **two major announcements** on Monday October 1: one at 10.10am on shaping the future of early childhood education and one at 3pm on the same day on the primary teachers’ and principals’ campaign. This includes an update on next steps after an emphatic rejection by teachers and principals of the Ministry’s latest offers in the current collective agreement negotiations.

Also, the unions’ leaders panel at 9am on October 1, will welcome the impact of collectivism by exploring, and learning, from the experiences of other unions.

The union leaders include: **Sam Huggard** secretary of the NZCTU, **Sandra Grey**president of the Tertiary Education Union, **Muriel Tunoho** president of E Tū and speaker from the United States **Dale Lee**, president of the West Virginia Education Association which is part of the National Education Association. Mr Lee’s involvement in the victorious nine-day work stoppage in early 2018 sparked the _Red for Ed_ movement across the United States to advocate for public education employees and quality public education. His work ensures public education funding remains a priority for elected leaders at both the West Virginia state and local level and has resulted in salary increases across the sector.
