Education consultation group masks real Government agenda

**Education consultation group masks real Government agenda**

NZEI Te Riu Roa is concerned that the Minister of Education, Hekia Parata is using an education sector consultation group as a soft front while the Government continues to pursue its real agenda for education behind the scenes.

Treasury has proposed that the Cross Sector Forum on Raising Student Achievement, which was set up following last year’s class size debacle to allow the government and the education sector to work collaboratively, be used to discuss more palatable changes while hiding harder edged changes away from the spotlight.

NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter says the documents reveal what NZEI has suspected for some time.

“Treasury has proposed yet another cynical and underhand attempt to mask the Government’s real education agenda of competition, privatisation and winner and loser schools.

“We want the Minister to make it clear that she firmly rejects the Treasury advice.”
