There are now more than 60 kura kaupapa throughout the country.

Lester Flockton was a teacher for 23 years then assisted in establishing the National Education Monitoring Project (NEMP) which provides information on how primary students are performing across all areas of the curriculum and identifying areas where work needs to be done to lift their performance.
