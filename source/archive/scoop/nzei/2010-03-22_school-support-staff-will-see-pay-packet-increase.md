**School Support Staff Will See Pay Packet Increase**

Thousands of school support staff will see a boost in their pay packets this week after the ratification of a pay settlement reached last year.

Support staff work at the frontline of education supporting children and schools in roles such as teacher aides, administrators, librarians and sports co-ordinators. They are historically one of the lowest paid groups of workers in the country.

Late last year, after a long and vigorous campaign for fair pay a settlement was reached between their union NZEI Te Riu Roa and the government. The agreement, which runs until the end of March next year will deliver a 1.4% pay increase to most support staff. It will also lift the minimum pay rate for support staff from $12.94 to $14.00 an hour – representing an 8.2% increase and a significant achievement in the ongoing fight against low pay.

NZEI spokesperson Gaye Parlane says the settlement was achieved through the determination of support staff around the country to have their issues of low pay addressed. As part of the campaign they presented a petition signed by around 17,000 people including teachers, principals, parents and Boards of Trustee members to show that school communities were behind them in their fight for fair pay.

“While we are celebrating this pay increase, it is only a small step in the campaign to have support staff recognised as skilled professionals. There are still issues such as the bulk funding of support staff salaries, improved career pathways, job security and enhanced terms and conditions which need to be addressed,” says Mrs Parlane.

NZEI has also settled the collective agreement for another group of support staff members – Kaiarahi i te Reo, Therapists, Assistants to teachers for students with severe disabilities and Special Education Assistants and this is currently out for ratification.

The settlement also addresses low pay issues by introducing a minimum rate of $14.00 an hour and delivers a minimum increase of 1% or more to members covered by this collective.
