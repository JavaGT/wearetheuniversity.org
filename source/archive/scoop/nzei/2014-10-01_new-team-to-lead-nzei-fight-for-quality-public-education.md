New team to lead NZEI Te Riu Roa fight for quality public education

The Annual Conference of NZEI Te Riu Roa today elected Louise Green, Principal of Khandallah School as President to lead the union’s fight for quality public education.

“In an environment where there are continuing challenges and threats to our education system and our members as education professionals, the time was right to stand as National President,” said Louise Green.

“Today, hundreds of our members took their opposition to the Government’s controversial Investing in Educational Success to the public in Rotorua,” said Louise Green. “We will continue to push for a better plan of alternatives in our own schools and communities.”

“Charter schools and national standards are just two examples of the government’s attacks on the foundations of our quality public education system. As well as resisting these NZEI Te Riu Roa plans to be at the forefront of promoting change in our education system that has children’s welfare and educational achievement at their centre.”

Louise Green brings to the role 30 years experience in education, 20 years active service in NZE Te Riu Roa and 6 years as the NZEI nominee on the Teachers Council.

Fiona Matapo from Dunedin was elected Vice President at the Conference. Fiona is a Facilitator for Professional Learning Development, “Whaia te karaingatira”, in Literacy Maori Medium. She also works in resource development for Huia Publishers and Learning Media. As well as her education and NZEI Te Riu Roa experience, Fiona has been the Convenor of Unions Otago for the past two years.

“Child poverty and inequality continue to grow in importance as public concerns,” said Fiona Matapo. “NZEI Te Riu Roa will continue to push for real solutions to child poverty, and for all our children to be supported outside the classroom to do the best they can at ECE and at school."
