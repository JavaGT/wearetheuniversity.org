NZEI Involved in Schooling Strategy Workshops

NZEI Te Riu Roa is involved in 120 workshops throughout the country, beginning next week, that will help teachers, principals and school board members implement the Schooling Strategy.

The union has combined with the School Trustees Association, the Principals Federation and the Ministry of Education to organise the workshops. They begin on Monday (May 8) and continue for six weeks, ending on June 22.

The principal of every primary, intermediate, area and special school and kura kaupapa Maori as been invited to attend a workshop in their area along with a teacher and board member from their school.

"The workshops will enable principals, teachers and board members to learn about the strategy and how it can be used to focus thinking and guide school planning," says Irene Cooper, the National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa.

The Schooling Strategy 2005-2010 was launched by the Government in July last year. It has the goal of all students achieving their potential and identifies three priorities that schools should focus on to reach that goal. These are: all students to experience effective learning; this learning to be nurtured by their families and whanau; and all school staff to further engage with evidence to inform their practice.

"NZEI has taken on the role of project leader for these workshops because the union's members are totally committed to enabling children to reach their full potential," says Irene Cooper.

"We can't achieve this alone and the workshops enable principals, teachers and board members to get together and map out what their schools will do to reach the strategy's goal."
