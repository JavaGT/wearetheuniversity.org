Early Childhood sector takes stock and looks to the future

**Early Childhood sector takes stock and looks to the future**

Hundreds of teachers will meet in Auckland this evening to discuss the future of early childhood education in New Zealand.

The event comes twenty years after the introduction of Te Whāriki, the internationally renowned early childhood curriculum and will focus on how to strengthen it for a rapidly changing education environment. The original writers of Te Whāriki, Dr. Helen May and Dr. Margaret Carr will be part of an expert panel that will lead discussion.

Dr Joce Nuttall, who recently chaired the Ministerial Advisory Group on Early Learning, will contribute by asking why Te Whāriki is unevenly used across the sector and what can be done to strengthen it.

“Te Whāriki was one of the first curriculums for early childhood internationally,” says Dr Nuttall.  
“It is truly aspirational in its vision for children’s learning and development.”  
She questions whether a growing focus on assessment has weakened actual engagement with the curriculum and asks what ordinary teachers and their colleagues can do to sustain and strengthen the curriculum.

Jeanette Clarkin-Phillips, a researcher from University of Waikato, will also contribute to the symposium, leading discussion around the impact of market forces on quality of early childhood education provision.

Julie Brice, another panel member, has recently visited schools and early childhood centres as part of the NZEI/Ministry of Education Joint Initiative working party.

She has been particularly impressed that educators in both sectors are building strong and seamless systems that help children transition through the early years of education.

The symposium has been organised by NZEI Te Riu Roa. It is being held at the Music Auditorium, Faculty of Education, University of Auckland from 6-8pm, 16 July.
