School Support Staff critical to student success

For Immediate Release  
  
  
**School Support Staff critical to student success**

School support staff are the unsung heroes of the education system and need to be better recognized.

School Executive Officer, Gaye Parlane says increasing demands on teachers has meant more demands on support staff such as administration executives and teacher aids.

“Schools are employing more support staff and expecting more and more from them.”

Today is Support Staff Day and Mrs Parlane says this is an opportunity for schools and the community to focus on the critical role support staff have in our schools.

“This is a group that has become more professional over the years and is playing a huge part in the delivery of quality education.”

“Certainly most support staff are in the job because of a love of learning and teaching and quite frankly, schools would fall over without them”.

But unlike teachers, their wages are not centrally funded and their employment is under the control of schools which can result in less job security.

However, Gaye Parlane says today is a time to focus on the hugely positive contribution that Support Staff make to their school.

“This is an opportunity for the rest of the school community to celebrate their work and for support staff to also acknowledge that contribution.”

“So around the country, many schools will today be acknowledging Support Staff Day and taking a little time out to thank their support staff.”
