Kindergarten Teachers To Consider Pay Claim

Thousands of kindergarten teachers are attending paid union meetings around the country to vote on a pay claim to take into negotiations next year.

The union representing kindergarten teachers, NZEI Te Riu Roa, says the claim is important as it reflects the significant change in the kindergarten sector.

Many kindergartens are re-organising into full day services, as well as coping with increased demand, fuelled by the 20 Hours Free policy.

NZEI National Executive member Judith Nowotarski says the union claim emphasises the importance of kindergarten leadership and the impact of change on teaching teams and the roles of head and senior teachers.

“Kindergarten reorganisations change the way kindergartens operate and the hours and conditions of work for staff. It is important that those changes are reflected in teachers’ pay and employment conditions,” she says.

Kindergarten teachers are seeking a pay increase to maintain pay parity with primary school teachers.

46 paid union meetings are being held around the country until the end of November. Negotiations on a new employment agreement are scheduled to start at the beginning of next year.
