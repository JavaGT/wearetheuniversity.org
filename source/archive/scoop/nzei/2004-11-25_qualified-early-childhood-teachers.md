NZEI Supports Having More Qualified Early Childhood Teachers

NZEI Te Riu Roa welcomes Government moves to enhance the quality of education in the early childhood sector by providing incentives for early childhood centres to increase the number of registered and qualified teachers they employ.

Education Minister, Trevor Mallard, has announced new funding rates for early childhood education centres with higher funding rates for those that employ a greater proportion of teachers who are registered and qualified.

The Minister has also confirmed funding to support the pay parity agreement negotiated last month by NZEI Te Riu Roa for a thousand early childhood teachers. The union represents a total of 3500 teachers and support staff working in early childhood centres.

"NZEI Te Riu Roa applauds the government's move to increase the number of registered and qualified teachers working in early childhood," says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.

"This is because research clearly shows that employing registered and qualified teachers improves the quality of education provided at early childhood centres."

"The research also shows that children who receive quality early childhood education perform better at school and carry the benefits into adult life."

"The investment the government is making to help early childhood centres employ registered and qualified teachers will pay huge dividends that will benefit the whole country," says Colin Tarr.
