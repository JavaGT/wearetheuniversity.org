Yet More Evidence of the Chaos Around Standards
===============================================

**Yet More Evidence of the Chaos Around National Standards**

An independent survey on the implementation of National Standards provides yet more evidence that they are unworkable and there is widespread confusion among schools and parents, according to the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa.

The survey of 350 schools by the New Zealand Council for Educational Research shows there is considerable variation in where schools are at with the Standards and the way they are reporting back to parents. It also shows the vast majority believe the timeframe has been rushed and there is a real lack of understanding.

NZEI says the survey clearly justifies the strong concerns about National Standards which continue to be expressed by academics, principals, teachers, boards and parents.

The government is now suggesting that schools use their National Standards information to start setting student achievement targets from the beginning of next year.

“It’s clear from this survey and from what we’re hearing from schools that that is totally unrealistic,” says NZEI President Frances Nelson.

“The level of understanding and confidence in the Standards is so low that schools cannot possibly do what they’re being asked to do. And because of the differences in the way the Standards are being implemented, any information or target setting against them is going to be completely unreliable and inconsistent across schools.”

The NZCER survey points out that National Standards work is more complex than people realise and getting consistency around them will be difficult.

“The government has repeatedly ignored calls to trial the Standards but how much more evidence does it need to realise that it needs to stop, listen and address the serious flaws in its National Standards policy?” asks Ms Nelson.
