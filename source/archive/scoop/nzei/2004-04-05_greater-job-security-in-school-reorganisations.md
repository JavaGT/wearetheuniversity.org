Greater Job Security In School Reorganisations

NZEI Te Riu Roa has negotiated greater job security and improved surplus staffing provisions for its members who are involved in the stress and upheaval of school reviews and reorganisations.

The new provisions cover 35,000 members of the union who work as teachers, principals and support staff in the primary school sector.

They were agreed to after three days of talks between NZEI Te Riu Roa and the Ministry of Education.

Despite the February 23 announcement of a five year moratorium on school reviews there are 168 schools undergoing reviews that were begun last year. The Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, intends to reorganise most of these schools next year and has announced plans that include, closing schools, merging schools and decapitating schools – this involves removing Year 7 and 8 students from primary schools and adding them to secondary schools.

There are more than 3000 NZEI members working in the 168 schools currently under review.

“These teachers, principals and support staff are under huge stress because of the uncertainty the review process and the planned reorganisations have created about their future,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.

“They are working hard in a difficult situation to provide a stable learning environment for their students and to assure parents that their children are continuing to receive a quality education.”

“That’s why we are pleased to have successfully concluded these negotiations and to have gained the job security these school staff deserve.”

“This has been achieved by reaching agreement with the Ministry on variations to the collective agreements covering principals, teachers and support staff that will minimise job losses during school reorganisations.”

“The variations will also ensure that when a staff member does lose their job because of a school closure they will receive fair compensation.” says Colin Tarr.
