NZEI Supports Increased Investment In Environmental Education

Education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, fully supports an increase in Government spending on environmental education in our schools.

The Greens' Education Spokesperson, Metiria Turei, announced today that the Government will spend $13 million dollars over four years to support environmental education in schools. The funding comes as a result of the agreement negotiated by the Greens' and Labour after last year's election.

"The environment is not a renewable resource," says Irene Cooper, the National President of NZEI Te Riu Roa.

"It's essential that we teach our young people about the need to protect their environment and provide them with the knowledge and skills they'll need to create a sustainable society and economy."

"As principal of Hillcrest Normal School in Hamilton, I've been involved with the Enviroschools Foundation, and applaud the Government for providing it with extra funding, as I know that it runs fabulous programmes," says Irene Cooper

"The students at Hillcrest are involved in recycling, planting gardens and trees, establishing worm farms and a host of other environmental activities."

"These provide the students with practical lessons about the world around them and about sustainability, plus they're fun."

"Funding environmental education represents a sound investment in our future," says Irene Cooper.
