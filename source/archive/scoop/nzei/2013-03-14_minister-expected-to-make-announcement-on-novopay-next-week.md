**Minister expected to make announcement on Novopay next week**

NZEI Te Riu Roa says it is expecting that early next week the Government will finally address many of the issues that have been plaguing schools and school staff for the past six months.

This follows a meeting this morning with the Minister in charge of sorting Novopay, Steven Joyce, Ministry of Education officials and school staff representatives.

“We very much look forward to hearing the details of that announcement,” says NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter.

“It has been a long road to get these issues addressed and members’ patience have been stretched.

“NZEI has been calling for a package of measures to address issues such as compensation, as well as the future of Novopay and the fixing of thousands of systemic issues.”
