**NZEI supports student action  
over climate change**

**11 March 2019**

NZEI Te Riu Roa supports young people who are planning to strike for climate justice this Friday.

While the strike will largely be attended by secondary school students, NZEI is aware that some primary students will attend with whānau.

"Today's children will be the ones who have to live with the consequences of adults' apathy and inaction over the past few decades. They're rightly angry, and it's about time politicians around the globe started thinking beyond the next electoral cycle," said NZEI President Lynda Stuart.

Ms Stuart said having an understanding of environmental, political and social issues was part of the curriculum.

"Some primary-aged children are passionate about these issues and plan to attend climate change rallies with their families this Friday. It will be important that they liaise with their school about attending," she said.

"I know many schools will use Friday's action as a springboard for discussions about the environment and related issues."

Ms Stuart has joined more than 1200 New Zealand professors, researchers and educators in signing an open letter supporting young citizens taking strike action around the globe this Friday.
