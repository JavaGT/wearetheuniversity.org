Early Childhood Needs Same Funding Guarantee as Schools

**Christchurch Schools Will Welcome Additional Funding But Early Childhood Needs Same Guarantees**

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says it’s pleasing to see the government responding to the needs of Christchurch schools, but is asking whether early childhood centres will get the same funding guarantees.

The Government has just announced it is extending full operational funding to earthquake-hit Christchurch schools until the end of the year.

NZEI has been working closely with those schools and lobbying the government to listen to their concerns and provide the stability and certainty they need.

“It’s a commonsense decision which is in the long-term interests of education in Christchurch,” says NZEI President Ian Leckie.

“Schools and teachers in throughout the city are working tirelessly to provide stable learning environments in the face of damaged facilities, reduced rolls and traumatised students. The additional funding will give them much needed breathing space and allow them to continue their focus on getting teaching and learning back on track.”

However early childhood centres and kindergartens have had no such funding guarantees and many are facing an uphill battle to stay open.

“We know that particularly in the eastern suburbs rolls are dropping as families have moved out, or are out of work and can no longer afford to keep their children in early childhood education,” says Ian Leckie.

NZEI is concerned that will result in centres closing their doors and children in some areas not able to access early childhood education.

Ian Leckie says while it’s great to see the government responding to the plight of Christchurch schools, early childhood centres are just as important in providing stability for young children and families, and they should have the same sort of funding assurance.
