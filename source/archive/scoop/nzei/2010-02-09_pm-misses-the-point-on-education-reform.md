PM Misses the Point on Education Reform
=======================================

**PM Misses the Point on Education Reform**

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa says the Prime Minister is clearly missing the point by promising further educational reform around an untried system of National Standards.

In his statement to parliament today John Key hinted at more upheaval in the education sector as part of a wider programme of social sector reform. He said there will be further reform on top of National Standards but failed to give any details.

The government is already implementing National Standards, arguing they will raise student achievement. It is pushing ahead in the face of mounting opposition and concern from parents, teachers and educationalists that the Standards are being rushed and are completely untested. There is no evidence that they will benefit children’s learning and there is growing community support behind NZEI’s call to “Trial National Standards, not our Kids”.

“The government is signalling it is prepared to put schools and children through another round of reforms based on an untrialled system. It should not be gambling such large amounts of money on uncertainty and children’s education,” says NZEI President Frances Nelson.

NZEI is also calling on Mr Key to explain in “plain English” what exactly he means by “refocusing the tens of millions currently aimed at struggling school students”.

“Will this just mean a lot of money-shuffling and cuts to existing education programmes which are already effectively targeting struggling students such as reading recovery?” asks Ms Nelson.
