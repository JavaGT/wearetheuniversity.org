NZEI RELEASE

18th June 2008 For Immediate Release

  
Special Education Staff To Consider Pay Claim

Up to 900 Group Special Education field staff will be attending paid union meetings over the next two weeks as part of a bid to improve their pay scales and professional conditions.

They are represented by the education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa and include special education advisors, psychologists, speech language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and early intervention teachers.

NZEI President Frances Nelson says “this is highly specialised and committed group which works in different schools and centres, providing a valuable service to some of the country’s most difficult and vulnerable students.”

NZEI will be presenting a pay claim to members which seeks to improve pay scales for Group Special Education staff to reflect their specialist skills. It also aims to ensure they receive more professional support and development.

30 paid union meetings will be held around the country, ending on July 4th. NZEI will be asking its members to endorse the pay claim, and negotiations are set down with the Ministry of Education for July 14th.
