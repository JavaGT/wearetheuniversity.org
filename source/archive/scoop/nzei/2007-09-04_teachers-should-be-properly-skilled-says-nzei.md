Teachers Should be Properly Skilled, says NZEI

### Teachers Should be Properly Skilled, says NZEI

NZEI President Irene Cooper says the union believes all students have the right to be taught by qualified and registered teachers and the Council should not be making decisions based on teacher shortages and supply issues.

“Parents have every right to be concerned about their children being taught by unqualified teachers. The fact is this is a backwards step. There is a teacher supply crisis - the latest figures from the Department of Labour put primary school teachers in the top ten list of highest vacancy “high skill” jobs, but using LATs to fill vacancies merely masks the reality. Extending LAT positions is an expedient response which is not acceptable in the longer term.”

Ms Cooper also says “extending the length of LATs means children could face extended periods with unqualified staff, before schools must search again for a registered teacher.”

“What is required is proper workforce planning that ensures the profession is attractive, well paid and well resourced. This would help stop the brain drain which sees hundreds of skilled teachers leave the country each year, and ensure our trained beginning teachers are incentivised into jobs in New Zealand,” she says.

NZEI, which represents 27,000 primary teachers, is currently in negotiation with the Ministry of Education on a pay claim and Ms Cooper says good pay and employment conditions are essential for the recruitment and retention of teachers.
