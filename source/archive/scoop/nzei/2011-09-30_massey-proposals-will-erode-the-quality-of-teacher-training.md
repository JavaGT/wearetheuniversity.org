**Massey proposals will erode the quality of teacher training**

Trainee and beginning teachers are angry over proposed changes to teacher training programmes at Massey University.

In a paper entitled “College of Education Academic Reform”, the Pro Vice Chancellor of the College of Education James Chapman, is proposing radical change to initial teacher education. It proposes to discontinue all undergraduate teacher education by cutting its three-year Bachelor of Education Early Years degree and the four-year Bachelor of Education Primary. That would mean students could only study teacher education through a one year, graduate diploma.

There are also serious concerns about another proposal to merge the Massey University College of Education into an Institute of Education beneath the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, with an increased focus on attracting post-graduate research. This move will threaten the jobs of teaching staff involved in initial teacher education, who aren’t classed as “research-active”.

Young and New Members (YMN) of the New Zealand Educational Institute believe the proposals could be incredibly damaging to teacher education in New Zealand. Jennifer Langridge, currently studying a graduate diploma through Massey says \"although post graduate study can produce quality teachers, post-graduate students often agree that the pressure-cooker situation of being pushed through training and out into the 'real world' often leads them to be burnt out and feel underprepared in some areas of the classroom."

Emma McKay and Sarah Thomas, co-presidents of Massey University College of Education Students’ Association (MUCESA) agree, arguing that undergraduate teaching qualifications must be offered alongside post-graduate.

"Students at the College of Education believe that post-graduate teacher education should not be the sole pathway to a teaching career. Students are concerned that all teachers being trained in one year will be detrimental to the future of quality education in New Zealand primary school classrooms."

Third year teacher Liam Rutherford says the move undervalues those teaching now.

“It simplifies what it means to be a teacher and the huge amount of effort and professionalism it takes to shape the students we encounter. Learning is not a linear process where teachers input knowledge and then students output understanding. It’s laughable to think it is that simple.”

YMN recognises that Massey University College of Education is the first to fall victim to the Government’s reduction in undergraduate funding and the race to secure Performance Based Research Funding.

However it is urging Massey University not to shirk its responsibilities to train creative and motivated undergraduate students, and to continue its ground-breaking 4 year Bachelor of Education. It also wants to see the University challenge the growing assumption that post-graduate research is superior to undergraduate teaching.
