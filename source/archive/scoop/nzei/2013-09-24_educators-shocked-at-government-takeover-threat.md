Educators shocked at Government takeover threat

A visiting education expert says the Government’s threat to take over schools where students do not pass National Standards would be disastrous for education.

Education Minister Hekia Parata has threatened that the Government could step in and take over schools if students are deemed to be failing at National Standards.

This would be a giant step backwards for education, says NZEI National Secretary Paul Goulter.

“Clearly the Government has no understanding of education and is trying to turn our schools into sausage making machines turning out homogenous students.

“The Government needs to stop this nonsense before it does any more damage to students and to our schools.”

This view is backed by a visiting professor of education from the University of Oregon, Professor Yong Zhao says our current politicians’ obsession with standardised measuring and competition is counterproductive.

“Education is complex and can’t be reduced to a standardised and simplistic measurement of success.

“Children are not homogenous, do not learn in exactly the same way, and therefore need an education system that will enhance their talents, confidence and enjoyment.

Professor Zhao, who’s based his research on the implications of globalisation and technology on education, says it is vital that a school system can foster creativity and entrepreneurship if it is to equip today’s students for the 21st century.

Professor Zhao was born in China’s Sichuan Provence and was educated in China in his early years. He then went on to study in the United States and is currently Presidential Chair at the College of Education at the University of Oregon. His visit to New Zealand is being hosted by NZEI Te Riu Roa.
