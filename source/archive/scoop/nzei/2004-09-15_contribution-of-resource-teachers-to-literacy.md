ERO Recognises Contribution Of Resource Teachers  
To Literacy

NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr, says an ERO report released today recognises the valuable contribution the teachers who provide the Resource Teacher: Literacy (RT:Lit) service are making in our primary schools.

The RT:Lit service was established in 2001, expanding the work that had been done by Resource Teachers of Reading. The service targets students in primary schools who need extra help with their literacy skills, providing support for the students and their teachers and principals. RT:Lits work in clusters of schools throughout the country. NZEI Te Riu Roa represents 87 RT:Lits.

“The ERO report shows the work being done by these specialist teachers is having a positive impact on primary school students who are struggling with their literacy skills,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.

“The report states that the quality and consistency of teaching practice is high and that they had improved student achievement in a substantial majority of the schools in which they are working.”

“The report also states there was less evidence of improvement among Maori students receiving the service, although more than half the school clusters reported an improvement in the learning of their Maori students.”

“Overall the report provides a very positive picture of the work being done by RT:Lits and the success they are having in raising the achievements of students who are struggling to acquire literacy skills.”

“It shows there is a solid foundation to build on in developing the service in the areas that the ERO has identified need extra work.” says Colin Tarr.
