**Calling off Novopay debt collectors is welcome but too late**

NZEI Te Riu Roa is welcoming the announcement that the Ministry of Education will no longer use debt collection agencies to recover small amounts of overpayments to teachers caused by the Novopay bungle.

However, Past President Ian Leckie says that by far the biggest problem is the no payment or under-payment of teachers and school support staff.”

“So it’s extremely ironic that the Ministry saw fit to call in the debt collectors when, all around the country, teachers are owed thousands of dollars in outstanding salary payments.”

“It’s now been six months the debacle began and quite frankly, the Minister in charge of Novopay, Steven Joyce’s intervention over the latest bungle is welcome but too late.”

“We need the Government to understand that the time that has been taken to sort out this mess is unacceptable and it needs to place a bigger priority on either fixing the system or installing one that will pay teachers properly.”

“In the meantime we urge the Government to focus on fixing underpayments which is where the injustice of Novopay lies.

ENDS
