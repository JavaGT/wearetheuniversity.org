Tomorrow is World Teachers’ Day.

World Teachers’ Day is observed in more than 100 countries. It is promoted by Education International, which represents 26 million education workers worldwide, including the 43,000 that belong to NZEI Te Riu Roa

This year the event is focusing on the worldwide need to recruit more qualified teachers and the need to keep experienced teachers in the profession. Education International has set the goal that every child in the world should be receiving an education by 2015 which will require many more teachers, especially in developing countries.

NZEI Te Riu Roa is a member of Education International and endorses the EI statement that teaching must be “a profession of the future” by ensuring the work is “appealing intellectually, socially and financially.”

“The need to attract quality new teachers and keep experienced ones in the profession applies as much in New Zealand as it does in the rest of the world,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President, Colin Tarr.

“To do so we must ensure teaching is a desirable profession by ensuring that teachers are well educated, well resourced and well rewarded.”

“If we do this we will deliver quality teachers who will provide a quality education for their students and the whole community will reap the benefits.” “This is why NZEI is supporting World Teachers’ Day and endorses this year’s theme of recruiting and retaining quality teachers.”

“The union has produced a poster to mark World Teachers’ Day which it has distributed to all primary schools, early childhood services and other educational worksites where our members work. The poster has also been sent to public libraries,” says Colin Tarr.

NZEI Te Riu Roa members work as teachers and principals in primary schools, teachers in early childhood education services, support staff in primary and secondary schools, special education staff in early childhood, primary and secondary schools and school advisers based at colleges and schools of education.
