NZEI Endorses New Book on ICT Use in Schools

NZEI ENDORSES NEW BOOK ON ICT USE IN SCHOOLS

The country’s largest education union, NZEI Te Riu Roa, is hosting the launch of a new book that provides useful advice on how teachers and principals can use ICT to enhance learning in schools.

Cybercells – Learning In Actual and Virtual Groups is written by Professor Ken Stevens and Dr David Stewart. Ken is a Professor of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, where he holds the Chair of TeleLearning and Rural Education. David was the inaugural director of the New Zealand Principal and Leadership Centre at Massey University in Palmerston North, which provides professional support, development and training for principals.

NZEI National President, Colin Tarr, has written the foreword for the book and says he has no hesitation in commending it to everyone involved in providing quality learning opportunities for students in schools.

“For a decade now teachers and principals have lacked practical guidelines on the effective use of ICT in schools,” says Colin Tarr.

“There’s been debate over strategies but no one has translated this into well constructed practical approaches to ICT that schools could adapt for their own particular situation.”

“Ken and David have filled that gap with this book. They have used their understanding of what happens in classrooms to develop a set of ideas and possible approaches for teachers and principals to consider.”

“They provide ‘real life’ case studies, practical applications and clearly describe teaching and learning approaches that utilise ICT as a powerful learning tool.”
