Quake Support Staff in Canterbury acknowledged
==============================================

**Support staff acknowledged for their contribution to the earthquake recovery effort**

Support staff in ECE centres, primary and secondary schools who missed National Support Staff Day (June 15) because of the June 13 after-shock, will hold their own celebrations tomorrow.

NZEI Support Staff Canterbury Representative Gaye Parlane says the day will focus on the “awesome support” Christchurch support staff have given students, teachers and parents over the past year. Some schools will be marking the day with special events where staff will wear their trademark fluro pink tee shirts.

Mrs Parlane says many support staff have had their own homes and properties damaged, their lives disrupted and some have lost loved ones and friends. “The earthquake won’t stop our passion for what we do. We’re sleep-deprived and worn-out like most Canterbury people, but we’re determined to stand tall, and keep supporting our schools and each other,” she says.

New Zealand schools employ over 21,000 Support staff; more than 50 per cent are teacher aides. The group includes: librarians, office managers, administrators, ICT specialists, sports co-ordinators and therapists. They are essential in supporting children’s learning and in the day to day management of schools but are among the lowest paid workforces in the country, some earning just $14 an hour.

NZEI, the Union representing support staff has over 950 support staff members working in primary and secondary schools in and around Christchurch.

Gaye Parlane says Christchurch members are also calling on the Government to retain qualified and experienced support staff until the end of 2012. This means the Government keeping schools’ operations grants, from which support staff are paid, at existing levels next year.

“Support staff have always been at the forefront of job cuts in the education sector but falling rolls are also affecting ECE and primary teachers. Canterbury children need extra assistance and support now with their learning, so we hope people will also turn out in large numbers to support us at the "Support Canterbury Children" public forum at 7pm on Thursday October 6.

The main focus for Christchurch Support Staff Day will be a dinner at **Chateau In The Park**, starting at 5.30pm tomorrow (27/9)
