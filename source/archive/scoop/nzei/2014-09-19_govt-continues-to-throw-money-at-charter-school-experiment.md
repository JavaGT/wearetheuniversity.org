Govt continues to throw money at charter school experiment

19 September 2014

  
Official documents reveal the three primary sector charter schools approved last week will cost $2 million to set up as well as divert another $1.5 million of potential taxpayer investment from local state schools next year.

NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Judith Nowotarski says it seems that not only is the government prepared to rush the process of setting up of the new schools putting them at higher risk of failure, but it is also prepared to divert millions of dollars away from surrounding state schools.

“For instance, one of the schools will be set up in Mangere and will start next year with children from years one and two.

“That school will cost more than a million dollars in its first year made up of a $512,000 establishment fund and an operations grants of more than $600,000.

“This is money that could have been going to existing public schools in Mangere - schools that are doing a great job in challenging circumstances.

“These existing schools need the government to support them and their students instead of allowing a privately-run charter school to suck students and much-needed funding away.

“Likewise, in West Auckland, the Villa Education Trust has been granted nearly $2 million in its establishment grant and first year operations grant. In Whangarei, He Puna Marama Trust, which already runs a charter school for Maori boys from years 7-13 will be given around $800,000 in its first year to set up an additional year 1-6 school.
