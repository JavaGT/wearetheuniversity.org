NZEI Teachers And Principals Present Pay Claims

The pay claims for teachers and principals working in primary, intermediate and area schools, who belong to NZEI Te Riu Roa, were presented to the Ministry of Education negotiating team today.

Negotiations between NZEI Te Riu Roa and the Ministry are due to begin early next month.

“The NZEI negotiating team made it clear to the Ministry that issues surrounding their workload and their pay and qualifications must be addressed when we sit down next month to start negotiating these claims,” says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Colin Tarr.

“NZEI teachers and principals have huge workloads and say this issue must be addressed in these negotiations.”

“They are also adamant that the discrimination against the teachers qualifications must come to an end.”

“Teaching qualifications held by NZEI teachers are being used to shut them out of the top step of the pay scale they share with secondary teachers. This is unfair, educationally unsound and must stop.”

“NZEI teachers and principals have also made it clear that the Government must demonstrate a commitment to providing the professional development they need, so they can continue to provide a quality education for their students.”

“Evidence to support the claims was presented to Ministry officials today,” says Colin Tarr.

NZEI’s major claims:  
\- A 6% pay increase for NZEI teachers.  
\- A new pay scale for NZEI principals that would incorporate a 6% pay rise and include steps that delivered yearly pay rises.  
\- Extra staffing resources to provide NZEI teachers with non contact time to carry out work such as planning and assessment.  
\- Pay adjustments that fairly reward NZEI teachers for their qualifications and experience.  
\- Changing the salary unit allocation formula for primary, intermediate and area schools to bring it into line with secondary schools. Units are annual payments made to teachers for carrying out extra responsibilities
