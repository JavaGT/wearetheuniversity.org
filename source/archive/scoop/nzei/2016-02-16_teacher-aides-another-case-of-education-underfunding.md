Teacher aides – another case of education underfunding

16 February 2016

Revelations that teacher aides are among the worst off occupations over the course of their working life is a direct result of continued school and early childhood education underfunding, says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Louise Green.

As reported, an investigation by Universities NZ shows that qualified teacher aides are financially worse off than occupations with no tertiary qualifications.

“Teacher aides provide vital support for children who struggle, yet there are major disincentives for them to become more skilled and qualified.

“Most teacher aides are paid close to the minimum wage and those that hold relevant qualifications are entitled to receive an additional 29 to 58 cents an hour above the basic pay scale.

“We’re talking a ridiculously low amount of money – in many cases lower than a living wage.

“On top of that there is a disincentive for teacher aides to seek further skills or qualifications because they are funded out schools' operational grants. For many schools this can become unaffordable - the more they pay support staff, the fewer hours they can employ them for.

“For schools and ECE services it often comes down to a choice between teacher aides and things like upgrading technology or class trips.

“NZEI has been calling for teacher aides to be centrally funded and to be paid properly for many years and this report adds further weight to this call. The government needs to stop ignoring this vital area of children’s education."
