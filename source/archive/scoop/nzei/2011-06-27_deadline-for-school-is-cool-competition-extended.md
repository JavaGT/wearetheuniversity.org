**Deadline for “School is Cool” competition extended**

Due to popular demand and a request from principals, the deadline for Education Aotearoa’s School Is Cool competition has been extended two weeks until July 15.

Believed to be one of New Zealand’s largest on-line art competitions, School Is Cool is open to children from all New Zealand pre-school centres and primary schools. The competition celebrates New Zealand’s internationally well-regarded public education system – inviting teachers and students to identify and talk about what they like about school.

Education Aotearoa editor Jane Blaikie says the competition has really heated up over the past two weeks, with a flood of high quality entries from all over the country.

“There’s a lot of talent and variety our there, and the artwork we’ve received certainly shows that kids love school, which is a key factor in why we’re one of the top performing systems in the world,” she says.

“The competition website www.schooliscool.org.nz is easy to use, has a fantastic search and browse facility, and encourages people to “rave” about the art work and share it on social networks”.

Competition judges are award-winning children’s author and illustrator Gavin Bishop, and Wellington art teacher Gretchen Buwalda.

Schools/centres can upload their competition entries to www.schooliscool.org.nz . The competition will be judged across 10 categories: 1 for early childhood, 1 each for years 1-8, and one for digital entries. Prizes have been sponsored by Edtech and individual winners will each receive an iPod Touch. The three overall winners will receive a set of 5 iPads, or a set of 3 iPads, or a set of 2iPads.

Entries can be either a poster, up to A3 size, or a digital entry (maximum of 2 minutes in length). Entries can be from an individual or a group. The competition closes on July 15, with winners announced in late August.
