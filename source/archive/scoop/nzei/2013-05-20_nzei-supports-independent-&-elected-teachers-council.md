NZEI Supports Independent & Elected Teachers Council

**NZEI Supports Independent Teachers Council Elected “by Teachers, For Teachers”**

NZEI Te Riu Roa has welcomed recommendations that the Teachers Council be beefed up to become an independent organisation that can better provide leadership for the profession and support for high quality teaching.

The Minister of Education today has called for teachers’ views on the recommendations of a review committee that reported to her last year, before final decisions are made in July.

NZEI President Judith Nowotarski says the new body would need to be truly independent of Government if it is to have teachers’ confidence.  
“Teachers will want an assurance that they keep a direct say in who is on the Council,” she says. “Teachers pay more than 95% of the cost of the Council themselves currently.  It is critical that any new body that is "for teachers, by teachers", that there is direct representation of teachers on the Council.”

She says NZEI would welcome community members joining the new body, but that teachers should be in a majority on it (as is legislated for doctors currently in terms of the Medical Council).

She says another review recommendation, that would mean untrained people are given a permanent a “licence to educate”, would undermine quality education and put students’ learning at risk.

“Children’s education is too important to be left to people without professional knowledge and expertise about how children learn.  We believe everyone working in education should be life-long learners and be committed to up-skilling themselves.  The current “licence to teach” (LAT) framework aims to provide a transition arrangement for unqualified people and we would oppose any loosening up of standards in this area.”

She says the outcomes of the review must preserve and enhance the quality of teachers, because this is the fundamental reason New Zealand’s education system is successful by global standards.
