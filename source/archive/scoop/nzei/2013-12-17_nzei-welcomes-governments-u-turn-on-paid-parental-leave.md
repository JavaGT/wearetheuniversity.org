NZEI welcomes government’s U-turn on paid parental leave

**NZEI welcomes government’s U-turn on paid parental leave**

A back-down by the Government from earlier threats to veto Labour MP Sue Moroney’s bill to extend paid parental leave bill is welcome pre-Christmas news for thousands of New Zealand families, says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Judith Nowotarski.

“The bill will almost certainly be passed as a result of this shift.  It has the support of all MPs except National and Act.”

“Once passed, it will increase paid parental leave from the current 14 weeks to 26 weeks, and will have far reaching benefits for babies and their parents.”

“Giving parents the opportunity and support to spend those first months at home with their babies provides children with the best start in life.  This will pay significant dividends further down the track in terms of health and educational outcomes.”

NZEI Te Riu Roa is a member of the 26 for Babies Coalition – a group of organisations campaigning to increase paid parental leave.

ENDS
