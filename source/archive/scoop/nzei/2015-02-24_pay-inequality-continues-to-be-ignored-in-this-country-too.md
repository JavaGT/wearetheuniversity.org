Pay inequality continues to be ignored in this country too

24 February 2015

New Zealand women in many occupations including those working in education continue to be underpaid compared to men.

The issue of pay gender inequality in Hollywood became a feature at this year’s Oscars after Patricia Arquette called for equal pay for women in the film industry in the United States.

NZEI Te Riu Roa National Secretary Paul Goulter says pay inequality in this country is being totally ignored by the Government.

“More than six years ago an independent job evaluation report by the Pay Equity Commission showed that when compared with the male dominated job of corrections officer, education support workers were paid as much as $8 an hour less.

"Nothing has been done about that report. The National Government, when it came to office, abolished the Pay and Employment Equity Unit and sidelined the report, saying the pay issue would be dealt with through bargaining rounds.

"Since then pay gender inequality has increased, not decreased. In 2010 men earned on average $3.42 an hour more than women. By 2014 that gap had grown to $4.00 an hour.

“There has also been the case of Lower Hutt caregiver Kristine Bartlett who won both an Employment Court case and subsequent appeal by the employer against the decision.

"The case is now before the Supreme Court but it shows that there is no will by the Government to address an unfair and discriminatory employment practice that affects the working lives of thousands of women."
