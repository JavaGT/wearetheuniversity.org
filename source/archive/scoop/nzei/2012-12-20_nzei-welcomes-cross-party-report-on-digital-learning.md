Immediate Release

**NZEI welcomes cross-party report on digital learning**

The report of a cross-party parliamentary inquiry into 21st century learning environments and digital literacy makes an important contribution to advancing quality teaching and learning in New Zealand, says NZEI Te Riu Roa National President Ian Leckie.

The report calls for more research and consultation with educators about the development of policy in the area.

It also recommends ensuring equitable access to digital learning for all students, for bilingual resources for Maori and Pasifika learners, special needs students and for broader community access to digital learning, for example through public libraries.

"These recommendations are good news for educators.

"We particularly welcome the committee's emphasis on the need to engage the teaching profession in policy development, and to ensure that quality teaching and learning drives the use of technology, not the other way around."

Mr Leckie says educators and the wider community now need an open process and reasonable timeframe to develop policy and implementation proposals.

“Sustainable resourcing of early childhood education centres and schools would be needed to ensure the rhetoric about equity of access is translated into on-the-ground opportunities for all children. Resourcing specialist technical support and professional learning for teachers would also be necessary.”

Mr Leckie says NZEI wants to know more about any requirements to have defined standards of digital literacy.

“We would also stress that the Government's Network for Learning must have significant New Zealand content and services in order to be relevant to Kiwi students and would want to know how the Government would genuinely engage and collaborate with stakeholders and the teaching profession to support greater digital learning.”
