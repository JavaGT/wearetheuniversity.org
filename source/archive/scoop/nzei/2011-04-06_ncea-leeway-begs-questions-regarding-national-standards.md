NCEA Leeway Begs Questions Regarding National Standards

### NCEA leeway begs questions over unfair approach to National Standards in Christchurch

The education sector union NZEI Te Riu Roa is calling on the government to explain why it is giving leeway to Christchurch secondary schools over NCEA but won’t do the same for primary schools and National Standards.

The New Zealand Qualifications Authority has moved to reduce assessment programmes for quake-affected secondary students. It says the key goal is to minimise the disadvantage to students and maintain the credibility of NCEA.

NZEI believes it’s a fair decision which is in the interests of students but it begs the question as to why the same rules do not apply to primary schools and National Standards assessments.

School principals in Christchurch have told the government that National Standards are not a priority in the wake of the earthquake and they may not be able to implement them properly. The government has responded by saying National Standards are more important than ever and to get on with it.

“This inconsistent approach between NCEA and National Standards just proves that the government is determined to push through National Standards as part of its political agenda, rather than considering what is in the best interests of children and schools,” says NZEI President Ian Leckie.

“Christchurch schools should be able to focus on getting teaching and learning back on track and they should be given the courtesy of being listened to. They know what their students need right now and National Standards are not it.”

“It is shameful to see political ideology being placed above the wellbeing of students,” Mr Leckie says.
