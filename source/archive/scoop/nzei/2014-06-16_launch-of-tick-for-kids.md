Launch of Tick for Kids
=======================

**Monday, 16 June 2014, 2:28 pm**  
**Press Release: [NZEI](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZEI)**

Children to be at centre of election debate with launch of Tick for Kids

  
NZEI Te Riu Roa says that there is an urgent need to put children at the centre of government policy, and welcomes the Tick for Kids campaign, to be launched tomorrow, as a way to help achieve this.

“Education policy in recent years have been rolled out with too little thought as to how tamariki will be affected,” said NZEI Te Riu Roa President Judith Nowotarski.

“The cuts to quality funding for ECE and removal of the goal of 100% qualified and registered ECE teachers is one example. The recent $359 million “Investing in Education Success” policy doesn’t directly benefit a single child and may disrupt their learning if it results in taking teachers and principals outside of the classroom two days a week.”

NZEI Te Riu Roa will be working with dozens of organisations with an interest in children’s rights to decent health, education, income, and housing between now and the election to ask more of candidates and political parties.

“Our communities and families need to know how future governments will work with parents, early childhood educators, and schools to ensure that all children are getting the education they need for future success,” said Judith Nowotarski.

“Through Tick for Kids, our members will be working with others throughout the community to raise the profile of children as the most important issue in this election. “

Tick for Kids will be launched at Grey Lynn School, 44 Surrey Cres at 11:30 tomorrow, where students from the school will be asking questions of MPs and candidates from across the political spectrum.
