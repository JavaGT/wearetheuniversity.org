Teachers look forward to negotiations after strong show of support  
16 August 2018

Support for teachers and principals in rallies all over the country yesterday was overwhelming, says NZEI Te Riu Roa President Lynda Stuart.

“Without exception, from the big cities to small rural towns people turned up in their thousands. We have not seen anything like this for 24 years and it shows the depth of feeling and that it’s time for these important issues to be addressed. This has started a movement that will not be stopped now and it’s for the children of this country - it is their futures that we are talking about.”

A straw poll of the crowds at the rallies showed strong support for a two-day strike if it was needed, but this is only indicative of feeling, not a decision, Mrs Stuart said.

“We look forward to continuing negotiations with the Ministry of Education and will be entering these in good faith.

“We expect there will be a new negotiating mandate from the Ministry based on the strong show of support yesterday. We will take any new proposals out to members to consider before any decision would be made about any further industrial action."

Meanwhile, it has been reported in the media today that a 14 percent pay offer was on the table.

“I want to be clear about this - for 85 percent of teachers the offer is only just over 2 percent a year - which is not dissimilar to a cost of living increase.

“A larger increase has been offered to beginning teachers but would only bring their starting salary to above the average median.”
