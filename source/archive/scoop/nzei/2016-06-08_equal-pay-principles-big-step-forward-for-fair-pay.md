**Equal pay principles big step forward for fair pay**

7 June 2016

NZEI Te Riu Roa says the pay equity principles recommended by the Joint Working Group on Pay Equity are a welcome and significant move forward in ensuring women are fairly paid for their work.

National President Louise Green says it is great news for the thousands of underpaid workers in female-dominated occupations.

“We now have a framework and a set of principles that provide a constructive way forward. We strongly encourage the Government to endorse the principles and adopt them into the Equal Pay Act."

NZEI Te Riu Roa lodged a claim on behalf of Ministry of Education support workers with the Employment Relations Authority last October following Kristine Bartlett’s win in the Supreme Court against aged care provider Terranova.

“Education support workers employed by the Ministry of Education earn an estimated $8 an hour less than a comparable male-dominated job and that’s why we lodged the case with the court.”

“We are aware that paying workers in female dominated occupations a fair wage will have resource implications but this is about us as a just society choosing fairness for all women by ensuring equal pay for work of equal value.

“Women across New Zealand will now be looking forward to seeing the Government adopt the principles and seeing quick progress on implementing pay equity."
