Press release – April 15, 2009

  
Hot start to Uni Games 09

Medals, a cross-country dip and a game of two halves were among the highlights on the first day of competition at the Uni Games 09 in Taranaki.

At Hawera, it was so warm during the cross-country that some runners couldn’t resist a quick dip in one of the streams en route.

But Victoria University’s Tomas Bridgeman resisted the urge to submerge and went on to win the men’s 6km event, ahead of Mark Searle from Massey University in Palmerston North, and Kirk McDowall, also from Victoria.

The women’s 4km cross-country title was taken out by Samantha Blanch of Massey, PN. Kim King of Te Wānanga o Aotearoa (TWO) was second and Emma Fraser from AUT was third.

In the first rugby league match of the Games, the Auckland University side led the Taranaki Academy team from WITT 20-16.

The second half was a different story, with the Taranaki players surging ahead to win 62-28.

Academy education co-ordinator Rob Hewitt says the young men knew they hadn’t played up to their capabilities in a first half that helped the team build unity.

“At half time, (coach) Rangi Hiroti said to them that patience would win the game.”

He was right.

“I think they believed in each other and that’s what we have tried to instil in them over the past six weeks in the academy,” Hewitt says.

But he is still cautious about the WITT team’s chances. “We won’t get carried away because we know Waikato (TWO) have a full rugby league team and are here to play as well. So we will iron out the knocks, rub out the bruises and start again on Friday.”

Meanwhile, along with the cross-country, the karate and road cycling medals were decided today.

First results in were from the women’s road cycling race, which was won by Auckland University’s Jennifer Sweny ahead of team-mate Alice Ross. Mareeba Handgen from Massey’s Albany campus was third.

In the men’s race, Simon Honour from Waiariki Institute of Technology in Rotorua took the title, beating Kent Croote of Massey (PN) in a battle so close they both clocked the same riding time of 2.19:12. The contest for third place was just as tight, with three riders on 2.19:14, but it was Victoria University’s Daniel Coombes who got the spot.

Louise Burns, executive director of University Sport New Zealand, says things have gone smoothly on the first day of competition.

“Everybody seems to be out there having a great time,” she says.

“The competitive juices are flowing and there’s friendly rivalry between the different teams and campuses.”

Other results: Kata karate women’s premier open: Andrea Anacan (Auckland University) 1st, Sophie Anne Chin (Otago University) 2nd, Thi Hoang and Claire Rainer (both Victoria University) 3rd equal,

Kata karate men’s premier: Chris Singleton (Auckland University) 1st, Shong Ling Fong (Auckland University) 2nd.

Kumite karate men’s premier: Chris Singleton (AU) 1st, Zhiming Meng (AU) 2nd.
