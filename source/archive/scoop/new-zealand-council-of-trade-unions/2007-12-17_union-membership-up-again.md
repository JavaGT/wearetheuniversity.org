Union Membership Up Again

MEDIA RELEASE  
17 December 2007  
**Union Membership Up Again**

“The numbers of workers joining together in unions is increasing steadily with further growth in 2006, particularly in the private sector,” CTU secretary Carol Beaumont said today, in response to Victoria University’s annual survey of union membership.

“Union membership has increased every year for the last seven years, with a lift of 5,000 members in 2006 meaning that there are 80,000 more workers in unions since the end of 1999.”

“Critically, we are seeing growth in the private sector. This area demands our attention, and we have plans to keep on growing.”

“The dedicated union activity in retail and hospitality has seen the biggest rise in this sector last year for some time. While there is still a lot of work to increase the numbers of workers coming together collectively in these sectors to challenge low pay, the signs are positive.”

“2006 was a significant year for union activity, including a huge union campaign against an attack on workers’ rights through the 90 Days No Rights Bill, and union leadership and solidarity at all levels played a crucial role in beating the brutal lockout of 500 supermarket supply chain workers.”

“The union movement is positive, growing and determined. We have become a more active and visible union movement over recent years. Our union agenda for workers is broad, and we will continue to campaign for decent conditions and a fair share at work,” Carol Beaumont said.

Ends.
