Thousands more workers joining their union

“Over 12,000 more workers have recognised the importance of joining together in unions,” said Carol Beaumont, Secretary of the Council of Trade Unions.

The latest figures from the Industrial Relations Centre at Victoria University of Wellington, released today, show an increase of 12,427 more union members (up 3.4% from 2003) and that since 1999 NZ unions have grown in membership by 17% - an increase of 51,643 members.

“This is great news on the eve of the CTU Biennial Conference” said Carol Beaumont, CTU Secretary. “Our conference theme is Unions 2010 – and these figures show the union movement has a good platform to build on.”

“Workers will be building on successes like the 5% in 05 campaign as we continue to challenge low pay in NZ,” said Carol Beaumont.

“The NZ union movement has a wide agenda and we will continue to promote economic and social development that creates quality work for all New Zealanders, a real say for workers at all levels of society and public services that are high quality and accessible,” said Carol Beaumont.
