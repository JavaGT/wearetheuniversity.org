Thousands Of Workers’ Submissions Call For Tougher Safety Law

Between 5,000 and 6,000 workers have made written submissions calling for tougher health and safety law said Council of Trade unions president Ross Wilson today.

The submissions will be delivered to Parliament at lunchtime tomorrow, where they will be accepted by Labour MPs Mark Gosche and Rick Barker.

“This is the strongest stand taken over workplace law since workers supported the Employment Relations Act,” said Ross Wilson.

“Submissions are pouring into the CTU office from union members calling for n end to work-related deaths, injuries and accidents.”

The submissions will be delivered to Parliament at 12.15 tomorrow, when workers will also plant 500 white crosses in Parliament grounds.

A similar event will take place at the Parliament Street construction site in Auckland where Terua Tearoa tragically lost his life in January this year.

The Auckland event is also at 12.15 and 500 crosses will also be displayed in memory of the 500 New Zealanders who suffer work-related deaths annually.
