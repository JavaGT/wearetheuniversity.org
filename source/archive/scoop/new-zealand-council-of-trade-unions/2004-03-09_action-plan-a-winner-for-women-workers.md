Action Plan a Winner for Women Workers

Action Plan a Winner for Women Workers

“Fair pay, decent work, affordable, quality childcare and improvements to the student loan scheme outlined in the Action Plan for New Zealand Women will make a real difference for women workers,” Council of Trade Unions vice-president Helen Kelly said today.

The Government has committed to address these issues in the action plan, which is being launched today.

“Work-life balance, along with economic independence and well-being are the three priority areas in the plan,” Helen Kelly said.

“The CTU’s Get a Life campaign has shown that work-life balance is about basic issues like decent pay and conditions and it is great to see this approach reflected in the plan.” The action plan includes sections on Maori women, Pacific, ethnic and migrant women, women with disabilities, and older and rural women.

“This Action plan is stronger because it recognises the diversity of women, their issues and therefore the solutions required. One size does not fit all,” she said.

The CTU would continue to push for a stronger focus on the needs of low-income women, Helen Kelly said.

“It’s now time to get on with it, and put this vision for New Zealand women into action.”
