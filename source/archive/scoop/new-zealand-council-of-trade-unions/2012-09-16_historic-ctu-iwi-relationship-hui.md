Historic CTU/Iwi Relationship Hui - Hui Whakawhanaungatanga

On Tuesday, union members and Iwi leaders from around the country will join together for a national hui in Tauranga to discuss the potential of building a stronger relationship between Iwi and the CTU in order to improve the working lives of Maori workers.

CTU Vice President Maori Syd Keepa says \"this is a great opportunity to build on the powerful collaboration between Iwi and the CTU that developed to resolve the AFFCO dispute earlier this year. Maori are heavily represented in Union membership and want unions and Iwi to work together more closely."

Helen Kelly, CTU President says "this hui is a fantastic opportunity for us to recognise the contribution Iwi made to the workers at AFFCO, and to develop that initiative into other areas where we have shared interests such as decent work, strong public services and the power of social movements." "Inequality is growing, unemployment is persistently high and on the rise, wages are too low, and work is the primary economic activity for thousands of Maori workers. The time is right for us to build on the relationships we have between Iwi and workers, to work towards better outcomes for our Maori workers," said Helen Kelly.

Syd Keepa says "we are hoping to build relationships so that we can better meet the needs of workers, improve their working lives and provide a healthy, stable, cultural, social and economic environment for Iwi Maori."

Over 200 Iwi Maori and union leaders are attending the one day hui in Tauranga.
