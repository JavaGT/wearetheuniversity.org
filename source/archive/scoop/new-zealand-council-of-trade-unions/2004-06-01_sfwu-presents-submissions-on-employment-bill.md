SFWU Presents Submissions on Employment Bill
============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

SFWU Presents Submissions on Employment Bill

Media are advised that one of the country’s largest unions, the Service and Food Workers Union, will present its submission on the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill to the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee tomorrow, June 2, at 9.25am.

Groups of workers who are also SFWU members will present submissions the following day.

The SFWU represents thousands of workers such as cleaners and catering staff who face loss of employment, pay and conditions when the work they do is contracted out or changes to a new employer. The union will be urging the select committee to support the proposed law change to protect these vulnerable workers.

Led by the union’s national secretary, Darien Fenton, the SFWU will also be calling for improvements to the law to protect workers’ rights to collective bargaining, and to end employers’ practice of passing on union-negotiated benefits to non-union members.

On Thursday, June 3, at 9am, groups of workers employed by the TAB, IHC, Ryman Healthcare, Presbyterian Support Central and Ewart Hospital – who are also members of the SFWU – will tell the select committee their own workplace experiences, and why they need the law to change. The union’s Pacific Committee will also address the select committee members.
