NZCTU MEDIA RELEASE

CTU supports striking Unitec staff members

The Council of Trade Unions is offering its support to striking Unitec staff members, who are picketing their institution today and tomorrow in support of their claim for a better pay increase.

The workers are members of the Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association, and have been offered a 2.5% pay increase from Unitec New Zealand.

\"Unitec's offer of 2.5 % to staff is an insult, and is well below the current level of inflation," said Ross Wilson. "It is ridiculous for Unitec to expect their employees to see their real earnings drop."

"We are urging Unitec to come back to the bargaining table with a more acceptable offer than 2.5%," said Ross Wilson. "Other institutions in Auckland have settled on 4% or above, and Unitec shouldn't expect their workers to stomach anything less."
