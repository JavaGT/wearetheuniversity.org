EO Commissioner needs to leave National's policies behind

Equal Opportunities Commissioner needs to leave National's policies behind

The appointment by Judith Collins of a current National MP as Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner is a direct political appointment and as such it risks undermining the integrity of this crucial national human rights role says CTU President Helen Kelly.

Helen Kelly says \"Human Rights Commissioner roles are positions that need to be independent from direct government policy and influence. Jackie Blue is well respected on her advocacy on some women's issues and we recognise and respect that but she has been a voting member of a Government that has set women's issues back years with changes to pay equity initiatives, attacks on solo mothers, cuts to ECE services and other changes. Her direct appointment from the Parliament and lack of experience and knowledge on human rights are serious issues."

"The National party's policies on women are taking women backwards in this country and we need an EEO Commissioner prepared to advocate against this. We need someone who will stick up for the thousands of women underpaid and undervalued in the care sector, for the extension to paid parental leave and to equal opportunities for women getting on to boards and increasing their representation in other areas."

"We believe there are better people for this position and along with other recent appointments to the Commission are concerned for its credibility in the Human rights area."
