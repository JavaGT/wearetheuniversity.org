The People’s Choice Common Sense Plan
=====================================

The People’s Choice Common Sense Plan

Unions Canterbury welcomes the release of The People’s Choice Common Sense Plan as an alternative to the selling off of our assets being put forward in the Christchurch City Council’s Long “We do understand the enormity of the work still outstanding but we must move away from the either/or choice being stated by proponents for the sale that it is either sell off our assets or face higher rates,” Unions Canterbury Convenor, Karena Brown stated.

“This alternative plan gives the basis for an in-depth discussion that can look at all the alternatives without the scare tactics of massive rates rises. Any sale, partial or otherwise, of our assets will result in rate increases. It may result in a lower increase today but it will be the rate payer who will be required to make up for the lost income we currently receive from these companies.”

Unions Canterbury will be putting in a submission and intends to focus on 4 main points:

\- That the Council needs to renegotiate the Cost Share Agreement with the Crown with a view to establishing a priority list of Government and Council projects based on extensive and meaningful community consultation with the citizens of Christchurch.

\- That the extent of the projects in terms of how many, the scale and construction timing of agreed projects are all matters requiring careful consideration but central to that consideration must be keeping control and ownership of our strategic assets.

\- That the Christchurch City Council adopts a full review of its financial assumptions with a view to retain management, ownership and control of its Assets.

\- Any proposal by the CCC to sell any significant asset (fully or partially) shouldn’t occur unless full public disclosure occurs and Christchurch citizens have full opportunity to debate and make representations on those proposals.

Unions Canterbury, and its affiliated unions, represent over 40,000 workers locally.
