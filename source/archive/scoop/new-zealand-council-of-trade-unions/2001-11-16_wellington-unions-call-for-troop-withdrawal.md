Wellington Unions call for troop withdrawal

Wellington union members tonight called for “the government to withdraw the New Zealand troops from Afghanistan and replace them with increased humanitarian aid"

The Wellington Local Affiliates Council meeting, attended by members from a dozen different Unions heard reports from a number of delegates to the recent NZCTU Biennial Conference which urged "that the United Nations should be the primary body to consider how the world as a whole reacts to recent terrorist attacks"; considered an amendment from the National Distribution Union urging a "review and reversal of the government's decision" on making New Zealand military forces available to assist the US and UK forces in Afghanistan, which will be considered by the National Affiliates Council of the NZCTU at the end of November; and urged affiliates "to call on the government to withdraw the New Zealand troops from Afghanistan and replace them with increased humanitarian aid to the Afghani people, including refugees."

National Affiliate Council delegates in attendance at the meeting undertook to take the position to that meeting following speeches from a variety of Unions ranging from the Seafarers and Service & Food Workers through to the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education.
