Call to Tackle High Cost of Workplace Illness

Employers must take responsibility to tackle the hidden hazards that leave  
thousands of workers suffering from occupational disease, Council of Trade  
Unions president Ross Wilson said today.

Workers around the country will mark international Workers’ Memorial Day  
tomorrow, remembering those who lost their lives while at work or who died  
as a result of workplace injury or disease.

The report of the National Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Committee  
estimated 700 -1,000 deaths each year from occupational disease,  
particularly cancer, respiratory disease and heart disease.

Around 17,000 to 20,000 new cases of work-related disease are also reported  
each year.

“This represents a huge cost to workers’ health, to employers in lost  
productivity, and to the community,” Ross Wilson said. “The report  
estimates the total cost over a year of work-related disease and injury is  
between $4.3 billion and $8.7 billion.

“The cost of having a safe and healthy workplace is nothing compared to the  
cost - in terms of both money and health - of allowing workers to become  
sick, injured or killed on the job.”

Workplaces must get heath and safety systems in place which involve workers,  
as is required under the law, he said.

“The involvement and commitment of workers and management is the key to  
overcoming our dismal statistics of occupational disease,” Ross Wilson said.
