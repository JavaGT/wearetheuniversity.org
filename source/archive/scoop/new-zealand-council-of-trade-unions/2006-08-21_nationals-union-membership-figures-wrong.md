National's Union Membership Figures Wrong

Monday, 21 August 2006,

National's Union Membership Figures Wrong "Union membership has increased by 35,000 since 2000, and it is alarming that National's industrial relations spokesperson can't get even get these basic figures right," CTU president Ross Wilson said today.

"Highly visible union campaigns such as the 2004 Nurses' DHB Fair Pay campaign, Fair Share in 05, and SuperSizeMyPay.Com are bringing thousands of new members into unions that are getting results for working New Zealanders."

"With more than 300,000 members the Council of Trade Unions is the largest democratic organisation in the country and we give voice for working people in this country."

"National should stop wasting its time attacking the union movement and promoting its plan to deny all New Zealand workers unfair dismissal rights in their first 90 days on the job."
