MEDIA RELEASE

CTU Supports Business call for Vulnerable Worker Law Correction

“The Council of Trade Unions agrees with EMA Northern that thousands of workers will be disadvantaged by the Employment Court’s interpretation of the 2004 ‘vulnerable worker’ amendments to the Employment Relations Act in the Crest cleaning case,” CTU president Ross Wilson said today.

He was commenting on the full Court decision in Gibbs v Crest Commercial Cleaning released by the Employment Court yesterday. The CTU was an intervener party at the hearing.

“I agree with the EMA view that this was not the intended effect of the legislation and the CTU will be calling on Government to amend the Act as soon as possible to give effect to the true intention.

“In this case it was clearly intended by the Government that the employees engaged in kindergarten cleaning in Dunedin would be entitled to continued employment on the same terms and conditions when their employer lost a contract to clean kindergartens to Crest Cleaning Limited.”
