College of Education Sledgehammer Tactics Set Poor Example

“Sledgehammer tactics used by College of Education management in response to low-level industrial action by ASTE members set a poor example for other state sector employers,” said Council of Trade Union president Ross Wilson today.

College of Education responded two days ago to low-level industrial action by suspending all union members.

“This is no way to resolve collective employment negotiations with professional and loyal staff members,” said Ross Wilson.

Ross Wilson called on College of Education management to show reason in mediation and get the dispute resolved.

“The college lecturers, who are ASTE members, have made reasonable wage and work load claims, which deserve a reasonable response,” said Ross Wilson.
