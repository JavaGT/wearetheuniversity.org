Unemployment has got even worse

Unemployment has got even worse

Unemployment is now higher than many commentators predicted and has actually gone up slightly to 6.6 percent. For Māori it has gone up from 13.7 percent to 15.1 percent and for Pacific peoples from 13.1 percent to 13.8 percent.

Peter Conway, CTU Secretary said “today’s figures showing 157,000 people out of work tells us that many people are really struggling to get a job three years on from when the global financial crisis hit. Although there are more people in work than three months ago, there are also 3,000 more unemployed. This is due to 4,000 more women being unemployed while there is a drop by 1,000 in the number of unemployed men.”

It is notable that while Canterbury unemployment rose significantly (particularly for women) over the last year, its unemployment rate actually fell in the last quarter, while the rate in the country as a whole has risen.

“While unemployment in New Zealand is lower than in some other countries, we have gone from having the lowest unemployment in the OECD in 2005 to 12th lowest now, despite apparently having come out of the global financial crisis in better shape than most other OECD countries.”

Peter Conway said “this suggests that jobs are not a high priority for the Government.”

The jobless number which includes those discouraged from looking for work is over a quarter of a million people at 254,300. There are also 96,600 part timers seeking additional hours of work to make ends meet.

Youth unemployment for 15-19 year olds has fallen slightly but remains very high at 23.4 percent while there has been an increase to 12.2 percent in unemployment for those aged 20-24 years.

During this election campaign, all political parties need to spell out concrete plans they have for reducing unemployment.

“What the current Government is doing is simply not working.”
