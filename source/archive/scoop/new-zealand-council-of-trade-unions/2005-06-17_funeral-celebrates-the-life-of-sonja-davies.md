Her funeral will be held at the Wellington Town Hall on Sunday, June 19 at 4.30pm.

“Sonja left very clear instructions that her funeral service was to be a celebration of her long and achievement-filled life,” said her friend and lawyer Charles Chauvel. “We have been organising a farewell to Sonja that we hope will live up to her expectations and reflect the things in which she so passionately believed.”

Other speakers include Parliament’s Speaker, Margaret Wilson, CTU secretary Carol Beaumont, Sir Tipene O’Regan, on behalf of Sonja Davies’ iwi, Ngai Tahu, her brother, David Mackersey, and Charles Chauvel.

Labour MPs to confirm their attendance so far are Mark Burton, Lianne Dalziel, Helen Duncan, Harry Duynhoven, Ruth Dyson, Martin Gallagher, Marian Hobbs, Steve Maharey, Ross Robertson, Judith Tizard, Jill Pettis, Darren Hughes and Lesley Soper.

Women friends of Sonja Davies who are bringing her into the town hall for the funeral are expected to include peace activist Kate Dewes; Lynne Bruce, secretary, NZEI; Rosslyn Noonan, Chief Human Rights Commissioner; Margaret Shields, former Minister of Women’s Affairs; writer and publisher Diane Grant; film-maker Gaylene Preston; and the executive director of the Council for International Development, Rae Julian.

All sing ‘Bread and Roses’ as Sonja leaves the Town Hall

  
Bread and Roses  
As we go marching, marching, in the beauty of the day,  
A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray,  
Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,  
For the people hear us singing: Bread and Roses! Bread and Roses!

As we go marching, marching, we battle too for men,  
For they are women's children, and we mother them again.  
Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes;  
Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses.

As we go marching, marching, unnumbered women dead  
Go crying through our singing their ancient call for bread.  
Small art and love and beauty their drudging spirits knew.  
Yes, it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses too.

As we go marching, marching, we bring the greater days,  
The rising of the women means the rising of the race.  
No more the drudge and idler, ten that toil where one reposes,  
But a sharing of life's glories: Bread and roses, bread and roses.

Our lives shall not be sweated from birth until life closes;  
hearts starve as well as bodies; bread and roses, bread and roses.

Words James Oppenheim, Music Mimi Farina
