CTU backs striking AUT academics

Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson is backing the decision of academic staff at Auckland’s AUT to take strike action tuesday.

“The AUT Vice Chancellor should reconsider the pay offer, and bring these skilled workers’ salaries up to the going rate,” said Ross Wilson.

“The current pay offer leaves AUT staff lagging behind their New Zealand counterparts, and way behind the rest of the world.”

Ross Wilson said AUT’s failure to recognise the value of their workforce penalised students and the staff. “We need to upskill New Zealanders and to do this we need skilled educators,” he said.

“Continued undervaluing and underpayment just drives them offshore.”
