Delegates Gather in the Capital For Meeting with PM

The Prime Minister and Senior Government figures will this evening meet with around 300 union delegates in a major cross-union gathering in Wellington.

Representatives from the Council of Trade Union’s 34 affiliate unions are meeting with Prime Minister Helen Clark, as well as Paul Swain, Ruth Dyson, Steve Maharey and David Cunliffe.

“The forum is an opportunity for the Prime Minister and other Ministers to talk directly to union members about issues affecting workers – not only in the workplace but also their wider concerns about the economy and society,” said CTU secretary Carol Beaumont.

The meeting will break into workshop groups which will discuss specific topics with the relevant Government spokesperson. The workshops will be on the areas of employment relations, migration and productivity; work-life balance and pay equity; skills, training and tertiary education; state sector issues and education; and trade.

Carol Beaumont said it was important for political leaders to engage with workers about strategies for economic growth which required a highly-skilled and motivated workforce.
