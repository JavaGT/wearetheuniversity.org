CTU queries tax group composition

The CTU has today asked why the Government has not given consideration to wider input for the Tax Working Group.

Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Peter Dunne have announced the establishment of a Tax Working Group, which will assist the government in considering the key tax policy challenges facing New Zealand.

The private sector and academic experts on the group will include Rob Cameron, Paul Dunne, Arthur Grimes, Rob McLeod, Gareth Morgan, Mike Shaw, Geof Nightingale, Casey Plunkett, John Shewan, Mark Weldon, John Prebble and David White. Topics to be considered include the fiscal framework, and the structure of personal income tax, corporate tax, GST and tax integrity.

Peter Conway, CTU Secretary said: “This 12 man tax jury is certainly a group of experts, but I wonder why someone like Susan St John or others with strong credentials on equity issues and the impact of tax on low-income families were not considered for the panel?”

Peter Conway said he recognises that the group will consult and the CTU was included as part of a panel at a tax conference earlier this year addressing these issues.

“However, it does appear that while the group will have a range of views on equity and fairness dimensions in relation to tax, including the impact of higher GST on low income families, it is highly regrettable that the Government did not cast a wider net for the panel.”
