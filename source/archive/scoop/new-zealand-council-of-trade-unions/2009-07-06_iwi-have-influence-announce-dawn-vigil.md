**Press Release: [NZCTU](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZCTU)**

  
**E nga iwi, e nga reo, e nga rangatira, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena tatou katoa**

Iwi Have Influence (IHI) Action group announced this evening that a dawn vigil will be held each day this week on the summit of Maungawhau/Mt Eden. The vigils are being held to mark the importance of this week in the future of local governance in Auckland and are open to all.

Thousands of people from across Auckland and the country joined the Hikoi for Maori seats on the new supercity council, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance. As the Government select committee prepares to hear oral submissions this week, IHI Action group knows that many of the submissions received have strongly supported the call for Maori Seats.

"The call to meet on Maungawhau at dawn is an opportunity for all peoples of Auckland to show their belief in a new city that embraces its indigenous history and potential with pride" said Kaumatua Mokena Peeni

**Ka wikitoria tatou ka tutuki o tatou wawata mehemea ka whakakotahi tonu tatou**
