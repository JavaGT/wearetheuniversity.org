Letting workers know ‘what’s at stake in 08’
============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

CTU MEDIA ADVISORY  
14 September 2008.

Letting workers know ‘what’s at stake in 08’

  
Unionists will be distributing leaflets at transport hubs/main streets tomorrow (Monday) as part of the CTU Fairness at Work campaign.

Union activists letting workers know ‘what’s at stake in 08’

Unionists will be on the streets around the country tomorrow in a nationwide day of action handing out thousands of the Council of Trade Unions’ election leaflets, as part of the ‘Fairness At Work – Worth Voting For’ campaign.  
   
CTU president Helen Kelly said today there was a lot at stake for workers at this election.  
   
"The last 20 years has seen considerable changes in New Zealand politics that have had a big impact on Kiwi workers and their families. Workers know that governments can make a big difference to their working lives."  
   
“This election we are focused around three core themes of rights at work, strong public services and higher wages. The CTU wants to know where political parties stand on all three and we want to know what they plan to do about them in the future.”  
   
“The last 9 years have seen real improvements in workers’ rights such as fairer employment law, more holidays, increases in minimum wages, paid parental leave and KiwiSaver.”  
   
“As a union movement we encourage union members and their families to be active politically.  We think it’s not only a right, but a responsibility for people to be politically active.”  
   
“In the coming weeks unions will be closely analysing what each party's policies will mean for workers and their families. We know it's not what you say that counts, it's what you do.”  
   
Ends.
