Union Members Back Work-Life Bill

Union Members Back Work-Life Bill

The Green’s Bill for flexible working hours would make a huge difference in the work-life balance of thousands of workers with young families, Council of Trade Unions secretary Carol Beaumont said today.

The Employment Relations (Flexible Working Hours) Amendment Bill passed through its first reading in Parliament last night and has been referred to select committee.

It would give employees with young children the right to request reduced, part-time or flexible hours.

Many union members say that the pressure to balance work with family life is a major problem, Carol Beaumont said.

“We know the problem and we know that flexible working hours are part of the solution, but this needs backing in the law to make it happen for thousands of workers.

“Unions support the Greens’ bid to change workplace culture so it respects the needs of parents with young children to work hours that suit family life,” Carol Beaumont said.
