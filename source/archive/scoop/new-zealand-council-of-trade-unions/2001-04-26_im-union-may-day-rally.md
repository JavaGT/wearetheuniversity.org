"I’m Union" May Day Rally
=========================

**Thursday, 26 April 2001, 11:34 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

An "I'm Union" campaign will be launched at a Wellington Unions May Day rally in Cuba Mall at lunchtime on May Day, Tuesday May 1st

Pat Bolster, Secretary of the Wellington Affiliates Council of the NZCTU, sees the launch as being a celebratory occasion. "There will be live music - the Brass Razoo Solidarity Band, and Choir Choir Pants on Fire: a few speakers, including NZCTU President, Ross Wilson and a sausage sizzle. May Day, the day when workers around the world celebrate common cause is especially important given that Globalisation is threatening rights at the workplace everywhere”, he said.

The "I'm Union" campaign is designed to increase solidarity amongst workers in New Zealand workplaces. The first sign of this will be people wearing "I’m Union" stickers and thus able to easily recognise that colleagues are union members. Too frequently people are not aware that there are other union members in a workplace, when actually there are a large number. With the end of the Employment Contracts Act regime people need no longer feel isolated, afraid, and individualised. This campaign will help bring workers together.

The rally will start at 12:30 and run until 1:30, after which it is understood other groups wishing to celebrate May Day will take the stage.
