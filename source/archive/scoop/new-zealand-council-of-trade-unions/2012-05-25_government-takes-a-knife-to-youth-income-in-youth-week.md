Stand Up Media Release

**Government Takes A Knife To Youth Income In Youth Week**

The youth union movement, Stand Up, which represents young union members is dumbfounded at the Government’s decision to pick on young low paid workers and students as a means to fill the hole in the Government’s books, created by fiscally irresponsible tax cuts from 2010.

Stand Up Spokesperson James Sleep says the Government’s Budget delivers a raw deal for young workers and students during Youth Week, a week the country is supposed to be celebrating young New Zealanders.

“This is the week the Government should be celebrating young New Zealanders; however the message the Government has sent is that young people will be better off across the ditch”.

Sleep says yesterday’s Budget has left young workers hundreds of dollars out of pocket each year and students and graduates in a worse financial situation, with fewer pathways to achieve their aspirations.

“Young workers are some of our country’s most vulnerable workers. Young people delivering papers as contractors don’t always get a minimum wage and can earn as little as $3 per hour. Taking $14 million away from this group will impact more on these young people and their families, than the Government’s deficit.”

Stand Up says the Budget has also failed to adequately resource the fight against youth unemployment.

“We commend the Government for allocating 3000 more placements for Youth Guarantee, however this simply doesn’t cut the mustard. The Government has cut $155 million from youth support services. This has led to the imminent closure of services that support 18 and 19 year olds into work and training.”

“At a time when youth unemployment is high cutting back on services is the worst response”.
