DHB Grandstanding Over Proposal

CTU MEDIA RELEASE

DHB Grandstanding Over Abolition of Right To Strike Proposal

  
“Canterbury District Health Board’s call for the abolition of the right to strike for health workers is childish and grandstanding,” CTU president Ross Wilson said today.

“The right to strike is a human right guaranteed by international law,” he said.

“Canterbury DHB’s call is grandstanding and implies that the breakdown of negotiations is always the fault of health workers rather than the employer.  What they are really seeking is to give health sector employers a significant advantage in bargaining.”

“Their decision to ask for a law change shows bad faith and disregard for the agreement entered into between the CTU and all District Health Boards, including Canterbury, which acknowledged the right to strike and agreed minimum staffing levels and processes to protect risk to patients during strike or lockout action.”

“I expect the government will look dimly on Canterbury DHB’s suggestion,” concluded Ross Wilson.
