Otago Union Delegates Gather for Meeting with PM

The Prime Minister and other senior Government figures will this evening hear first-hand the concerns of around 150 union delegates in a major cross-union gathering in Dunedin.

Representatives from most of the Council of Trade Union’s 34 affiliated unions are meeting with Prime Minister Helen Clark, as well as Parekura Horomia, Paul Swain, Ruth Dyson, Pete Hodgson, David Benson-Pope and Rick Barker.

“The forum is an opportunity for the Prime Minister and other Ministers to talk directly to union members about issues affecting workers – not only in the workplace but also their wider concerns about the economy and society,” said CTU secretary Carol Beaumont.

The meeting will break into workshop groups which will discuss specific topics with the relevant Government spokesperson. The workshops will be on the areas of employment relations; work-life balance and pay equity; economic development and industry strategies; and Maori economic development and race relations.

Carol Beaumont said it was important for political leaders to engage with workers about strategies for economic growth which required a highly skilled and motivated workforce.

“Workers want to be a part of the economic growth of this country, and believe that growth needs to include fairness and social development,” she said.

“This forum is an opportunity for the Government and unions to talk about how that can be achieved.”
