Hui Focus on Maori Economic Development

Maori economic, social and cultural development tops the agenda at the Council of Trade Unions three-day Biennial Hui which starts in Wellington tomorrow.

More than 60 Maori trade unionists from around the country and a range of industries will be welcomed by CTU president Ross Wilson on Te Herenga Waka Marae at Victoria University.

The Minister of Maori Affairs, Parekura Horomia, will also address the hui on its opening day.

The hui theme is Te Ara Taumata Mo Nga Kaimahi Maori o Aotearoa, or The Way Forward for Maori Workers in New Zealand.

“The hui will focus on the role of unions in improving the well-being of whanau, hapu and iwi through education, skill development, and training opportunities,” Ross Wilson said.

“Many Maori workers are disadvantaged and discriminated against in the workplace, many are low-paid and have been denied opportunities for advancement.

“The hui will come up with strategies to help Maori workers get a fair go.”

The hui will also focus on working towards a union movement that’s based on the partnership principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The CTU Biennial Conference, scheduled for October, would elect its first Maori vice-president.

“We want to build a union movement that recognises Maori as equal partners and puts Maori issues as a fundamental part of union work,” Ross Wilson said.
