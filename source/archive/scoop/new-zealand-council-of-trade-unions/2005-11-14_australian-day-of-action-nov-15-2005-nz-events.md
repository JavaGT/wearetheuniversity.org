Media Advisory: Australian Day of Action Nov 15 2005 - NZ Events Summary

The Australian Federal Government is bringing in new industrial relations laws that will fundamentally alter Australian workplaces. The WorkChoices bill went through the Lower House late last week, and will be debated in the Senate shortly.

Changes proposed include removal of all unfair dismissal laws for employees in worksites with less than 100 employees (affecting 3.6 million Australian workers), existing conditions not being protected, the right for an employer to refuse a collective contract even if a majority of workers are unionised and want a collective, and moves to reduce the minimum wage.

Australian unions have organised a National Day of Community Protest, including a television link up with thousands of workers across the country at 9am Australian Eastern. Details at www.rightsatwork.com.au.

\* 11am - 12 noon (NZ time): Television linkup with Australia at NZ Racing Board building in Petone, Wellington.
