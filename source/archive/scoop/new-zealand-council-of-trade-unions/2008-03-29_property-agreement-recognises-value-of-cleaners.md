CTU MEDIA RELEASE

Property agreement recognises value of cleaners

“The work of thousands of low paid cleaners is being valued and recognised today through a landmark agreement signed by the cleaners’ union, members of the property services industry and government,”CTU secretary Carol Beaumont said today.

The “Principles for a Sustainable Property Services Industry” agreement was initiated two years ago through a campaign by the Service and Food Workers Union Nga Ringa Tota with unions in Australia, to address the poor pay and conditions experienced by commercial cleaners.

“Lifting low wages and improving other conditions of work can only be done effectively if it is done on an industry wide basis.”

“Responsible contractor policies and principles agreements like the one launched today, and in particular industry wide collective bargaining, provides the best opportunity and framework for addressing working conditions and wages.”

“The principles document signed today may prove a useful model for other industries and I congratulate all the parties-the union, government and property industry representatives- who signed it today,” Carol Beaumont said.
