Get Out and Vote campaign a success – Thousands of workers pledged to vote  

Tens of thousands of workers from all around New Zealand have embraced the Get Out and Vote campaign and have created their own personalised voting plan, the CTU said today.

“With three days of voting left in the 2014 General Election our campaign is in full swing, engaging with union members about making sure they get out and vote,” CTU Vice-President, Richard Wagstaff said.

“Workers have never run a mobilisation campaign like this before. We felt it necessary to do our bit to support and encourage union members to vote given the worrying numbers of people who didn’t participate in the last General Election. One of our key strategies has been about educating people that there is a voting period rather than just a voting day, and encouraging them to make the most of the advanced voting period.” Wagstaff said.

The CTU campaign has had teams of volunteers calling for the past three weeks from Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Nelson, Greymouth, Christchurch and Dunedin, supported by a team of paid callers in Auckland.

“On some nights we’ve had 100 people on the phones across New Zealand - union member to union member – reminding people that they can vote now.”

“We’ve also been able to tell people where the closest places to vote are – and with them worked out their voting plan, what day they’ll vote, who they’ll take with them and how they’ll get to the voting place.” Richard Wagstaff said

“Our campaign is completely non-partisan which has meant it’s been very straight forward just: Get Out and Vote.”
