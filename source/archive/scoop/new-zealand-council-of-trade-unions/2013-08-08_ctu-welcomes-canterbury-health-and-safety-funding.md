**CTU Welcomes Canterbury Health and Safety Funding**

The CTU is welcoming the Government's commitment to fund a dedicated health and safety programme targeting the Canterbury rebuild.

$10.7 million over the next four years is being allocated to the Canterbury programme as part of Government's Working Safer package.

"The building of Government and industry capacity in the Canterbury region to make construction safer is essential," says Paul Watson, CTU Canterbury Rebuild Recovery Coordinator.

"However, real success in meeting safety objectives will involve a partnership approach with all parties, including workers and their unions."

"Working Safer's strengthening of worker participation and systems at the workplace is a positive step. The CTU and unions in Canterbury have a major role to play in actively supporting and educating workers and their representatives so they can play a genuine role in keeping workplaces safe," says Paul Watson. "We look forward to a legitimate tripartite approach to construction safety and the leadership role the union movement plays in the safe rebuild of Christchurch."

Paul Watson said that unions are a partner with employers and the Government in the Safe Rebuild project in Canterbury which is supported by Government funding.
