Unions to Work with CERA To Ensure Workers Get Support

**Unions to Work with CERA To Ensure Workers Get Support**

The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions says it will be working with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission to assess the impacts on workers of the Government’s decisions on earthquake-damaged land.

While the Prime Minister today announced compensation arrangements for residents who live in what has been described as the residential red zone, the government says it has not finalised arrangements for businesses in those areas which have been rendered uninhabitable.

The potential impacts on workers include the loss or transfer of jobs as workplaces are forced to close, and changed work and transport patterns as businesses and families relocate.

NZCTU earthquake recovery spokesperson Marty Braithwaite said that unions needed the opportunity to engage with CERA and government to ensure concerns were identified and addressed.

“Recovery arrangements need to guarantee that there are adequate supports in place for workers, such advisors and employee assistance programmes to help them work through land-related issues, and also the flexibility to take time off work without loss of pay to attend to the same matters,” said Braithwaite.

Mr Braithwaite said “relocation issues will be important to address as workers often live within a short distance of workplaces and schools, and this is likely to change dramatically as peoples’ live are further dislocated.”

“Just as we expect supports to be put in place for business owners, we expect the same level of support to be provided to workers,” he concluded.

Union representatives will work with CERA on a regular basis to try and ensure that these matters are adequately addressed as they arise and the right support measures are put in place.
