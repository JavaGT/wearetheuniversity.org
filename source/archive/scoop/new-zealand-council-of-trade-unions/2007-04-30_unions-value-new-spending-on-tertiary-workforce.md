CTU MEDIA RELEASE  
30 April 2007

Unions Value New Spending On Tertiary and Workforce Education

The Council of Trade Unions is welcoming a pre-budget policy announcement today of additional funding for the tertiary education sector.

“Getting the investment in skills development and education right is a vital part of building a high wage, robust economy,” CTU secretary Carol Beaumont said.

“The tertiary education funding reforms, announced today, are an important step in the move towards a more collaborative sector. Additional funding for Polytechnics and Institutes of Technology (ITPs) and Wananga, in particular the ITP sector, will be important in helping them to increase their ability to collaborate more effectively.”

“The CTU welcomes additional funding for Industry Training Organisations to help identify current and future industry skill and training needs, which recognises and funds the important role they are required to play in offering leadership in their industry.”

“The CTU believes that ITOs should not be going it alone and the fund announced today offers the opportunity to collaborate on initiatives that lift the economy, identify current and future skill gaps and develop greater career opportunities for workers.”

“Unions are part of industry, and key stakeholders therefore in industry training. The success of the tertiary reforms will be dependent on the ongoing engagement of all interested parties in tertiary and workforce education, including unions, and we look forward to continuing an active role in this work,” Ms Beaumont said.
