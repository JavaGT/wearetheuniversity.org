MEDIA RELEASE

Striking Presbyterian Support workers have support of the union movement

“Striking members of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation and the Service & Food Workers Union have the full support of the union movement,” said Council of Trade Unions President Ross Wilson.

Workers at Presbyterian Support in South Canterbury, Otago and Southland, who are members of the NZNO and SFWU, are striking this morning and this afternoon for a fair pay deal from their employer. The union proposal includes a guarantee that the employers will pass on future government funding increases to their workers.

“Presbyterian Support has said that workers should be directing their attention at influencing government to increase funding. Unions and workers support moves to increase government funding to the sector, but fair pay for aged care workers should not be put on hold indefinitely while this happens.”

“We urge Presbyterian Support to return to the negotiating table with a fair offer for their workers,” said Ross Wilson.
