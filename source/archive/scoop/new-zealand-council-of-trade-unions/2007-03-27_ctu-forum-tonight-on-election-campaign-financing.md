### 

CTU Forum Tonight On Election Campaign Financing

Is our democracy “rule by the people” or rule by the corporate funders? How do we restore integrity and transparency to election campaign funding? What needs to change so ordinary New Zealanders feel they have an equal say in our political system?

Members of the public are invited to a public forum the Council of Trade Unions has organised on election campaign financing. Speakers include 'The Hollow Men' author Nicky Hager, electoral law expert Andrew Geddis (Faculty of Law, University of Otago) and lecturer and commentator Therese Arseneau (Dept of Political Science, University of Canterbury).

Details:

When: Tuesday March 27 2007, 7pm - 9pm

Where: VUW Rutherford House Lecture Theatre 1, Ground Floor, Cnr Bunny St and Lambton Quay.

More information: More information about the forum and the speakers is available here: http://union.org.nz/event/hollowmenMarch07
