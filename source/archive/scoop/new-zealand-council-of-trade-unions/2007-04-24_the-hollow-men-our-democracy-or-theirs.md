The Hollow Men: Our Democracy Or Theirs?
========================================

**Press Release: [Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

The Hollow Men: Our Democracy Or Theirs? Auckland Public Forum: May 1 2007

Is our democracy "rule by the people" or rule by the corporate funders? How do we restore integrity and transparency to election campaign funding? What needs to change so ordinary New Zealanders feel they have an equal say in our political system?

The Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi invites you to a public forum to address these and other questions.

Speakers include Nicky Hager, journalist and author of 'The Hollow Men', Dr Raymond Miller, Head of Department, Political Studies, University of Auckland and Laila Harré, union leader and commentator. There will plenty of time for questions and comment.

\* When: Tuesday May 1 2007, 7.30pm

\* Where: University of Auckland, Lower Lecture Theatre, (behind the Clocktower building) City Campus, Princes St.

\* For further information: visit http://union.org.nz/electionfunding

Ends.
