Young driver legislation will do nothing

**Youth Union Movement: Young driver legislation will do nothing**

The youth union movement, Stand Up, is calling on the Government to invest in professional driving training, to help save lives on New Zealand roads.

Stand Up Spokesperson James Sleep says the Land Transport Amendment Bill introduced to Parliament last night is a knee-jerk response to an issue that requires more in-depth action.

“We are seriously concerned that the Government’s decision to raise the driving age to 16 will only delay the issues the Government is trying to address on our roads. The Government’s action in this area will fail to significantly improve young people’s driving skills as it lacks any commitment to making professional driver training accessible and cheap for Kiwis.”

Sleep says that whilst the Government has the right intentions, it has failed to commit to the most important factor concerning young people’s ability to drive safely.

“The Government wouldn’t expect young people to master maths, English or science in secondary school if it cost $100 per lesson and wasn’t available in every community. A similar expectation needs to be applied to the important skill of driving.”

Along with the Bill failing in the area of education, the law change will also hurt thousands of young people and their families who depend on the use of a motor vehicle to access work, education and community activity.

“The Government’s failure to commit to exemptions for young people, particularly those in the heartland of our country, will harm the social and economic fabric of these communities,” concluded Sleep.
