Zero hour contracts officially history

**Zero hour contracts officially history**

Today in Parliament the Government, along with its support parties, and those in opposition, voted in agreement to end the ability of employers to use corrosive zero hour contracts.

“As a society we are changing. Modern work means treating working people with more dignity and respect. The fact that this legislation has received cross party support is testament to a new vision; a better working life for all kiwis,” said CTU President Richard Wagstaff.

“This better law would never have happened without those that lead the forward charge in articulating an alternative. Special acknowledgement to Unite Union members who have, for a number of years, told their very personal stories about what it means to have no security of hours or income from week to week,”

“Thousands and thousands of working people participated in creating a sea change. They wrote letters, lobbied politicians, attended rallies, talked to their friends and families. Today’s win is their win, it is a win for us all,” Wagsatff said.
