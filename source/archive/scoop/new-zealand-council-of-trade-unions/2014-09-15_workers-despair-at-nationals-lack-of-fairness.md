Workers despair at Nationals lack of fairness

Workers despair at Nationals lack of fairness

  
“Nationals Workplaces policy, released today, fails to articulate any vison about how life for working New Zealanders can be improved.” CTU President Helen Kelly said.

“Again if this policy focusses on removing work rights, its own documents say will drive wages down and the policy ignores the reality that workers in this country need a pay rise. The proposed legislation will remove the tea and lunch break making work more dangerous for groups like forestry workers and miserable for thousands of others. It ignores the reality that the 90 day trial period law is being misused by bad employers to dismiss thousands of workers without cause and it does nothing to reassure workers of security of employment.” Kelly said.

“Workers have real choices this election. In 100 days if Labour and Greens are elected all this negative employment law will be reversed, the minimum wage will have been increased and workers will be on a real path of progressive employment policies that recognise they live and work in New Zealand too and deserve a fair go.” Kelly said.
