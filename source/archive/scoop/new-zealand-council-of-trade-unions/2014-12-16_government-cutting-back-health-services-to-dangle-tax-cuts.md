Government cutting back health services to dangle tax cuts

Government cutting back at health services to dangle tax cuts

  
The health service is already too stretched, and cutting further into New Zealanders’ health services to fund tax cuts is irresponsible, the CTU said today.

Leaked cabinet committee papers have revealed District Health Boards need an additional $440 million next year but Treasury has recommended cutting this back by $190 million.

“During the election, National cut the operating allowance for new spending back from $1.5billion to $1billion to allow them to dangle tax cuts in 2017,” CTU Secretary, Sam Huggard said.

“It is simply irresponsible to expect the health system to meet patient need and community expectations when the funding is so significantly cut, on top of years of underfunding, simply to cut taxes for the well off.”

“The thousands of cleaners, nurses, doctors, kitchen staff, physiotherapists and other workers who power our public hospitals, are already voicing their concerns about what funding cuts mean in terms of the work they do. Further funding reductions are unmanageable without major consequences.”

“Tax cuts for people already well off are irresponsible when it comes with the consequence of preventable deaths, prolonged illness and chronic staff shortages.”

Earlier this year the CTU estimated the Health Vote in Budget 2014 was $232 million behind what was needed to cover announced new services, increasing costs, population growth and the effects of an ageing population.
