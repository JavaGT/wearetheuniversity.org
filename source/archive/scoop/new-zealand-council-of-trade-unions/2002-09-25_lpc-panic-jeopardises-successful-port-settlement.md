LPC Panic Jeopardises Successful Port Settlement

“The latest moves by the Lyttleton Port Company are most unhelpful and a barrier to progress in the collective agreement negotiations,” said joint unions advocate Paul Goulter today.

“The company needs to reflect on the legality of the strategy of attempting to divide and rule the unions involved in the joint negotiations, but most importantly reflect on the damage caused by their behaviour which impedes a successful outcome,” he said.

“Jeopardising the negotiations in this manner is not in the best interests of any party, including staff, customers or the public of Canterbury.”

Paul Goulter good faith obligations remain with respect to the joint union negotiations underway.

He said the combined unions remain committed to a successful settlement.

“The unions are committed to reaching a negotiated settlement on this manner and are meeting on Thursday to consider how this can best be progressed,” he said.
