Youth Rates Vote Significant Recognition of Young Workers

“Last night’s youth rates vote is a huge step forward for thousands of young workers who when this change is implemented will receive a big increase in pay and a recognition that the work they are doing is being properly paid,” CTU president Ross Wilson said today.

Parliament last night voted to progress Sue Bradford’s youth rates bill to a final reading, after an amendment was passed limiting the 16 and 17 year olds new entrant provision to 200 hours or 3 months, whichever is the lesser.

“There was important support from the business sector with the NDU and Progressive Enterprises settlement, and an acknowledgement that this is in line with business expectations.”

“It is good to see strong support from a range of political parties on this matter, and I acknowledge the initiative that Ruth Dyson has taken to bring together a broad consensus around this,” Ross Wilson said.
