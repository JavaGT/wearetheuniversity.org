### Young workers will be hit hard by new labour laws

The youth union movement, Stand Up believes the 90 day law is not the answer to creating sustainable employment opportunities for young people.

“The Government has been selling the 90 day law to young people as a job creation initiative, yet, our youth unemployment is currently one of the highest in the OECD despite the 90 day fire at will law already being in place for small businesses. We want to see sustainable job opportunities for young people, what we’re getting instead is reduced rights at work.” says Sleep.

Sleep continues “Young people are the most vulnerable and will be the hardest hit by the 90 day legislation due to many young people being under prepared when they head into the labour market.”

Stand Up also believes many tertiary graduates will be left high and dry as wage and salary earners begin to think twice before shifting into a new job because of the law changes that come into effect today.

Stand Up spokesperson James Sleep says “The 90 day fire at will law will create a sticky labour market, where job security will be on the minds of wage and salary earners who might choose to remain in their current position rather than having to go on a 90 day trial period in a new job.”

“We also think this will lead to young graduates finding it even more difficult to get work in the area they studied for as there won’t be the jobs available to them.” concludes Sleep.
