Framework A Realistic Recognition Of Issues
===========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

Innovation Framework A Realistic Recognition Of Issues

  
“The Government‘s Growth and Innovation Framework announced today is a realistic recognition of the failure of past policies and the strengths of New Zealanders,” said secretary of the Council of Trade Unions Paul Goulter today.

“The framework recognises that the way forward is as partners – government, business, unions and the research and tertiary sector,” he said.

“The setting up of the advisory board and associated taskforces is welcomed and unions will be fully participating in the process.”

Paul Goulter said the targeted areas of biotechnology, communication and creative industries were obvious choices.

“However, it is welcome news that those areas where industry strategies are already underway, such as the wood industry, will not be disadvantaged,” he said.

Paul Goulter said continued recognition of the critical need for skill strategy was an essential part of the innovation framework.

“That raises issues for workers of the accessibility to training and upgrading and appropriate reward,” he said.
