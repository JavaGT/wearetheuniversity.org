Campaign Challenges Business
============================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

“There’s work to be done, together.” - Campaign Challenges Business

The Council of Trade Unions has today launched a broadsheet under the banner “There’s work to be done, together” which challenges business to work with unions on the real issues facing New Zealand.

“It is a message for business to focus on the real issues, rather than campaigning against every Government measure which might benefit working New Zealanders – including the amendments to the Employment Relations Act,” said CTU president Ross Wilson.

“Our broadsheet states union members’ vision for the future which challenges business to work with unions to build a high-skill, high-wage economy for a better way of life for all New Zealanders.”

The broadsheet will be sent to business, political and community leaders over the next few days.

The CTU is also campaigning to support and strengthen the amendments to the ERA that are contained in the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill.

Workers and union members are expected to send thousands of postcards to the Minister of Labour, Paul Swain, supporting the Bill and the amendments proposed by the CTU.
