MEDIA RELEASE

Spare a thought for those working today

The Council of Trade Unions is asking New Zealanders to spare a thought for those working on Christmas day and other public holidays this summer break. "While the majority of us enjoy the Christmas and New Year break with friends and families let's spare a thought for the thousands of workers at work on the Christmas and New Year holidays," said CTU Secretary Carol Beaumont.

"In the past, many people worked for little or no extra pay and often against their will. Thanks to the more modern holidays legislative environment we now have, people required to work on any of the 11 public holidays are recognised by being paid time and a half plus a day in lieu," said Carol Beaumont.

"There is a need to ensure that employees are able to get balance into their lives, both for their benefit, and for the good of their families and communities. The Holidays Act provides for this - and we should all remember that at this time of year," said Carol Beaumont.
