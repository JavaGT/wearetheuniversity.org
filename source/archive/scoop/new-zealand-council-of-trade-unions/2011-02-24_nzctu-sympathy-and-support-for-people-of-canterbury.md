### NZCTU sympathy and support for people of Canterbury

The Council of Trade Unions sends sympathy and support to the people of Canterbury.

CTU President Helen Kelly said that unions held a national meeting today and expressed their solidarity with all those affected by the earthquake. “The loss of life and injuries are terrible,” she said.

The CTU has received many messages from unions around the world.

Helen Kelly said that right now the focus has to be on the loss of life and the injured as well as the rescue effort and meeting the necessities of life. But she said that, as with the 4 September earthquake and aftermath, there will be many other issues.

“We will work with the Government and business community to support enterprises and workers on issues such as any loss of jobs, business interruption, health and safety, ACC, welfare payments, pay, leave, relocation and counselling.”

Helen Kelly said that unions recognise we all need to work together as a nation at this time.

She paid tribute to the emergency workers, medical staff and all those providing immediate assistance.
