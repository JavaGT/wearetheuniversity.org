No note required to vote

CTU Media Release

20 November 2011

**No note required to vote**

CTU President Helen Kelly reminds workers, and their bosses, that everyone has the right to time off to vote.

Helen Kelly said ”hundreds of thousands of kiwi’s will be working on Election Day, Saturday 26 November, but that doesn’t mean they need to miss out on voting. I want to remind kiwi workers - you’re allowed time off to vote on the 26th, even if you have to work on Saturday.”

The law states that workers must be allowed time off no later than 3pm to go to vote – and the time must be paid. If, because they are doing essential work or are delivering an essential service, and have to work after 3pm, they are entitled to at least two hours paid time off at some stage before the polls close at 7pm. The relevant legislation is Section 162 of the Electoral Act.

“Workers have other options and lots of opportunities to vote in this year’s election and referendum - one option is to cast an early vote. People can vote any day this week at advanced polling booths set up around the country, you can check the Elections website to see where you can place your advanced vote.”

“And people can enrol to vote at any NZ post shop until to 4 p.m on Friday 25th November.”

“This year’s General Election and Referendum on MMP is our chance to have our say on the issues that matter to us as workers, as family members and as union members. Having to work on the day doesn’t mean you can’t have your say.”

“While reminding people of their right to vote, we also want to encourage young people to vote and have produced several resources aimed to explain the importance of voting including a humorous video clip ‘voting - it decides stuff!”
