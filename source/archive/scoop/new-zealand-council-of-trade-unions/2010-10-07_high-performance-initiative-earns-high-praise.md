High performance initiative earns high praise

**High performance initiative earns high praise – CTU**

The Council of Trade Unions has welcomed the announcement by the Government of a programme to support high performance work initiatives.

Peter Conway, CTU Secretary, said: “Government ministers and officials have worked with the CTU and Business NZ on this proposal. It will complement the Productivity Commission by focusing on practical activities at a workplace level to lift performance and improve productivity.”

Peter Conway said that in recent years the CTU had run workshops on productivity issues for thousands of delegates. As a result unions right across the public and private sector are involved in a range of programmes to involve workers in high performance work systems.

“This fund will add impetus to this engagement.”

“If we are to lift wages in New Zealand, we need to boost the minimum wage, improve the spread of collective bargaining, but also lift productivity and ensure the benefits flow on to both jobs and incomes. So although we may disagree with the Government on some matters, we certainly welcome this initiative.”
