CTU joins methyl bromide protest

**CTU joins methyl bromide protest**

The Council of Trade Unions is joining calls today for a ban on the use of the toxic gas methyl bromide for fumigating logs at New Zealand ports. The CTU is part of the Coalition Against the Use of Methyl Bromide which held a protest today in Wellington near the waterfront timber yards.

“New Zealand’s use of methyl bromide has actually been increasing despite being a signatory to the Montreal Protocol which calls for its use to be gradually phased out,” said CTU President Helen Kelly. “Since log exports to China alone more than doubled between 2008 and 2009 New Zealand is effectively sanctioning increased use of this dangerous chemical, despite the fact that China, like most of the major importers of New Zealand timber, will accept logs fumigated by other means.”

“Not only is methyl bromide toxic to humans, proven to be a neurotoxin, it is also an ozone-depleting chemical 60 times more powerful than the chlorine in CFCs which used to be used in aerosols. If global industry can successfully eradicate CFCs from a product as ubiquitous as aerosols, surely the New Zealand timber industry can take serious steps towards phasing out methyl bromide. It is just another blow to our ‘clean green’ image.”

“As we approach Workers Memorial Day on Wednesday it is an appropriate time to reflect on the dangers of exposing port workers to this entirely avoidable hazard. As well as the possible link to a suspiciously large cluster of motor neurone disease cases in Nelson port workers, a question mark hangs over the primitive usage of the gas which could expose other workers and residents in the vicinity of these facilities. Thousands of people drive, walk and work near the Wellington timber yards every day, ignorant of their proximity to such a toxic chemical being released into the atmosphere.”

“We call on the timber industry and the Government to take serious steps to first reduce and then abolish the use of methyl bromide in New Zealand.”
