**Press Release: [Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

**CTU announces election of new Secretary**

The contested election for the position of CTU Secretary has been won by Sam Huggard. Sam officially takes office on Monday 1 December 2014.

Sam has worked in the union movement and brings a wealth of experience and a commitment to workers and their unions.

This vacancy was created by the notice of resignation of Peter Conway given by him in early 2014 to take effect this December 2014.

Sam currently works in campaigns for FIRST Union, and before that worked at the CTU. He has previously led groups in the not-for-profit sector and was an NZUSA Co President in 2000 and 2001.

ENDS
