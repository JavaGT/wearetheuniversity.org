Spare A Thought Today For Those At Work

"While most of us are enjoying time with friends and families today, let's spare a thought for those at work on Christmas Day today and during the New Year holidays," said CTU president Ross Wilson.

"Many thousands of workers like those in emergency services, health and transport are at work over the summer break, providing essential services for the rest of the country."

"The time-and-a-half payment and a lieu-day for people working on public holidays is a small acknowledgement that these days are important social and family occasions and that a sacrifice is being made by those who work," Ross Wilson said.

"Unions are proud to have led the campaign for better recognition of workers who are required to be at work during these days."

"The Holidays Act requires a bit of minimal fairness in encouraging employers to give staff the day off, or paying them more if they can't. Despite some protests from business interests, this is a small recognition to those who continue to be at work today and during other public holidays," Ross Wilson said.
