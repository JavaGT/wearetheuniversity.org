Fairness rallies the start – more to come

**Fairness rallies the start – more to come**

Several thousand workers rallied in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch today in protest at the Government’s proposed employment law changes. The rallies, organised by the CTU brought together workers from every sector of the economy in a celebration of Fairness at Work.

CTU President Helen Kelly said: “This was the start of our campaign against these unfair law changes. Today we are announcing a national day of action on Wednesday 20 October.”

Today’s rallies were addressed by workers, some of whom had been sacked unfairly under the 90 day law for small businesses which the Government wants to extend to all workplaces. There were also speeches from church leaders and union officials, as well as musical performances, dance and other entertainment.

“The Fairness at Work campaign will include submissions to the select committees on the Holidays and Employment Relations Acts, and we will be taking our message to Parliament, to employers, to workplaces and to the public over the coming months,” said Kelly.

“The government proposals are unworkable, unnecessary and unfair. For instance, the removal of the right to appeal against unfair dismissal in the first 90 days along with weakening of procedural requirements and remedies against unfair dismissal thereafter amount to an attack on the job security of every wage and salary earner in New Zealand.”

Workers will also march in Dunedin tomorrow at 11.00am from the Dental School in Great King Street to The Octagon.
