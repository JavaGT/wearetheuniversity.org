CTU Media Release

**Govt intervention in Pay Equity case no way to mark Suffrage Day**

Reports today that the Minister of Labour may consider  intervening in the recent historic pay equity victory for Kristine Bartlett and thousands of other low paid women workers is no way to mark 120 years of Women’s Suffrage, says CTU President Helen Kelly.

Helen Kelly says “this case was huge step forward for the rights of working women, and the Government and employers have to take heed of the Court’s finding.  Caregivers and other low-paid women workers are rightfully celebrating this finding: it shows that for far too long “women’s work” has been under-valued and underpaid. Now it’s time for the Government to step up and rectify the underfunding that caregivers have paid for over decades”.

“This case is a great boost for women workers and their unions to argue against pay rates being determined by the fact that the women workers are working in female-dominated occupational sectors.  It is unthinkable that the Government would intervene against the Court decision.

“Any intervention from the government needs to be a positive one –to recognise the inequity and injustice in the aged care sector and adequately fund the sector so that the women who work in aged care are no longer discriminated against.”

“We support the SFWU and other unions who represent caregivers in this long awaited process for equal pay for worker of equal value for caregivers,” says Helen Kelly.

The CTU and affiliates are hosting a Suffrage Day event this afternoon and will be presenting Kristine Bartlett with an award recognising her contribution to pay equity and to working women’s rights. Lisa Heaps, Director of the Australian Institute of Employment will also speak on landmark Australian pay equality cases and about a rights based approach to pay equity.
