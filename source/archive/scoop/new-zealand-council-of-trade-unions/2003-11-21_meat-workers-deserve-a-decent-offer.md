Meat Workers Deserve a Decent Offer

The employer at a Canterbury abattoir must make a decent pay offer to bring to an end indefinite strike action by its workers, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson said today.

Members of the Meat Workers Union employed at the Malvern abattoir, near Ashburton, walked off the job at midnight on November 12 in support of their claim for a five percent pay rise.

“These workers have had little in the way of a pay rise in recent years,” Ross Wilson said. “And now their employer has come up with a nil pay offer.”

Several mediations have failed and there is no prospect of further talks, he said.

“The behaviour of the management at the Malvern abattoir is yet another example of why the Employment Relations Act needs to be strengthened to deal properly with employers who fail to show good faith in bargaining with workers,” Ross Wilson said.
