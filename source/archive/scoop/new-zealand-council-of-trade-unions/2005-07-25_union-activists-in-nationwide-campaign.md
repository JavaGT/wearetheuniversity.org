Union Activists in Nationwide Campaign

Union Activists in Nationwide Campaign

Trade unionists from around the country are marking the announcement of the election date by handing out leaflets reminding voters that there's a lot at stake in this general election.

Unionists will be on the streets in several centres tomorrow handing out thousands of the Council of Trade Unions' leaflet \"Will Your Vote Work for Working People?"

The leaflet urges voters to get on the roll and to consider how each party's employment policy would affect their jobs, pay and employment opportunities.

"The CTU doesn't tell working people how to vote but the leaflet outlines the differences in the main parties, and the smaller parties that support them," said CTU president Ross Wilson.

"National has declared war on workers with its employment policy that would allow new employees to be sacked after 90 days for no reason and with no right of appeal.

"That party wants to bring back the Employment Contracts Act which, for thousands of workers during the 1990s, meant pay cuts and losing conditions such as overtime and penal rates."

Workers had won significant gains under the policies of Labour-led governments since 1999, Ross Wilson said. "Employment policies hit workers in the pocket and unions are urging voters to think carefully before they vote."
