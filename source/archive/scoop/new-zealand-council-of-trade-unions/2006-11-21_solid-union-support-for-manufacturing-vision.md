Solid Union Support For Manufacturing Vision

Union calls for action on a manufacturing strategy are leading to a greater recognition of the economic development needs of this key New Zealand industry, the CTU said today after a national manufacturing summit in Auckland.

"Our call for a national strategy for manufacturing to address the impact of China led to this initiative, and we congratulate the Manufacturing Vision group for coming up with a way forward for a modern, viable and growing manufacturing sector in New Zealand," CTU president Ross Wilson said.

A Vision for World Leading New Zealand Manufacturers - A Strategic Framework was released at a Manufacturing Plus summit in Auckland today.

"The Report has a series of recommendations about improving government focus on manufacturing, attracting workers to manufacturing, celebrating the success of the sector, promoting best practice and initiating more specific strategies at a sub-sector level across the broader manufacturing industry."

"This will build on initiatives in broadband, tertiary education reform, infrastructure and energy to underpin a strong manufacturing sector."

"The CTU has also submitted in the Business Tax Review in support of tax credits for research and development and investment in skills," Ross Wilson said.

"The Report is out today but we must now move into action mode and the CTU will work with employers and the government to make sure that workers engage with this strategy."
