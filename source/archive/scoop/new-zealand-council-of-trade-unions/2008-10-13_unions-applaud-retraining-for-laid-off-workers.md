Unions Applaud Retraining For Laid-Off Workers

Unions Applaud Retraining For Laid-Off Workers

A retraining allowance will assist long-service workers if they are made redundant says Helen Kelly, Council of Trade Unions' President.

The Labour Party yesterday announced a new retraining allowance (on a similar basis to the student allowance) to apply to workers with five or more years' service if they are laid off.

Helen Kelly says that the CTU has been working with business groups and the Government on a programme called 'Security in Change' which aims to provide coordinated support for workers and firms when there is restructuring and likely redundancies.

"This new retraining allowance will be a welcome and very important addition to other types of assistance such as helping with CVs, advice, job-search and relocation".

Helen Kelly says that this sort of approach works well in many Scandinavian countries and sits alongside other progressive measures such as paid parental leave and free early childhood education to support high levels of workforce participation.
