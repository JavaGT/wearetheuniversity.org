Union Membership Continues To Grow
==================================

**Monday, 29 April 2002, 3:55 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

Today’s announcement that union membership is continuing to rise in New Zealand was welcomed by Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson.

The Victoria University annual survey of trade union membership shows the ranks of unions swelled by just under 11,500 in the year to 2001.

“Collective bargaining is on the increase and workers can see clearly the link between union membership and improved wages and conditions,” said Ross Wilson.

“The steady increase in union membership reflects not only the improvements in worker’s rights under the law, but a positive image of unions.”

Ross Wilson said that the CTU was working with unions to boost membership.  
This included traditional sectors such as construction, but also new occupational  
groups.

Membership of the CTU has grown significantly from 19 affiliates representing 189,000 in 1999 to 33 affiliates representing around 250,000 workers in 2002.

“The CTU is the largest democratic organisation in New Zealand,’ said Ross Wilson.

“We expect to keep getting larger, as workers continue to see the benefits of union membership.”
