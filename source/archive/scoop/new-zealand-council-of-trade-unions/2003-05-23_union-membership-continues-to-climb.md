Union Membership Continues to Climb

“The Victoria University annual survey showing that the number of New Zealanders in trade unions continues to grow is good news,” said Paul Goulter, secretary of the Council of Trade Unions today.

“We’re pleased at the rise of over 10% in union membership at the end of last year,” he said.

Paul Goulter said that the new statistics showed that workers increasingly want to become union members and negotiate their employment agreements collectively.

“But it is still a concern that some employers are in denial about this and continue to undermine collective bargaining,” he said.

Paul Goulter said unions were looking for improvements to employment law to promote collective bargaining.
