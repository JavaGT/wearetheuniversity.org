Concern at Maori Party Direction Over ACC

CTU Vice President Maori Concerned at Maori Party Direction

CTU Vice President Maori Sharon Clair expressed concern today at the policy direction recently taken by the Maori Party to support unfounded Government attacks on ACC and in particular the personal attacks on ACC Chair, Ross Wilson.

  
“Ross Wilson has overseen an Accident Compensation Scheme that is one of the most cost effective injury compensation schemes in the world. Employer levies (as a % of payroll) are more than twice as high in Australia, Canada, and the USA than under ACC in NZ.  Similarly, comparable motor vehicle no-fault schemes (such as Victoria Aust) have substantially higher motor vehicle levies,” said Sharon Clair. 

“Like all other investment funds ACC has suffered a reduction in the value of investments as a result of the international financial crisis. However, it has done better than every other fund manager, public or private both over the past 10 years and over the past 12 months under Ross’s leadership. In the first seven months of the current financial year to January 2009, ACC’s investments showed a return of 2.73%” she said.

“For a party that wants to be mana enhancing it is indefensible to get on National’s band wagon because it is aimed ultimately at privatising ACC and it spreads such great dishonesty against someone like Ross who has not only performed well in the role but is also is held in extremely high regard across the community, including the Maori community,” Sharon Clair said.

“Ross Wilson has dedicated his working life to matters of worker health and safety and is also a leader in Maori workforce development strategies and was responsible for establishing a Maori advisory board within ACC that has eminent Maori members advising on how ACC can better serve Maori, so it is extremely poor judgement that the party has joined in the attacks, and will be seen for the cheap politics it is.  Many Maori workers voted for the Maori Party believing it would uphold their rights and would work in a principled manner on issues such as this.  What we have seen this week will leave them feeling let down,” Clair said.
