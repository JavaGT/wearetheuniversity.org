Street Collections For Locked Out Workers
=========================================

Street Collections For Locked Out Workers Pulling in Thousands Each Day

“The public support this week for locked out distribution workers has been humbling and overwhelming,” CTU secretary Carol Beaumont said today.

“In the last 48 hours two $5,000 donations and a $10,000 donation have come in from New Zealand and Australia. United States unions are also organising their support for the workers.”

“Collections in Wellington are averaging over $1,000 daily, and $3,000 was raised during two hours of collecting in Auckland this week. We are also receiving unsolicited donations to our office daily.”

“The level of public support indicates to us that the New Zealand community is firmly behind these workers,” said Carol Beaumont. “The public clearly understand the issues and what is at stake. They do not agree with the bullying tactics of this large Australian company and are anxious to help in whatever way they can.”

“Progressive Enterprises need to understand the firm commitment from many quarters to ensure these workers are not starved back into their jobs. They need to take note of the very real public concern about the way they are treating their staff.”
