No Pacific Prosperity without prosperity for pacific workers

“There can be no Pacific Prosperity without prosperity for pacific workers,” Council of Trade Unions Secretary Carol Beaumont said today.

The Council of Trade Unions and its representative body Komiti Pasefika have been active participants in the Pacific Prosperity conference in Auckland this week, bringing a voice for working pacific people to the conference. An NZCTU statement to the conference is attached.

“There is clearly a need for a national programme around pacific social and economic development” said Carol Beaumont. “The prosperity of Pacific peoples is intrinsically linked to a social and economic investment approach that can lift participation in industry training and tertiary education, further reduce unemployment and lift incomes.

“Improving wages for pacific workers is an immediate priority, with the average wage for Pacific peoples being $15.20 compared with $20.14 for Pakeha/European workers.”

“We are committed to working with Government and businesses in economic and social development strategies. We will be following the outcomes of the conference with interest, and look forward to ongoing work around pacific development.”

“The real stars in the Pacific Community are those who struggle to support their families here and back in the islands on minimum wages and bad working conditions. It is these stars that must be acknowledged and supported. We must create Decent Work for all New Zealanders” said Carol Beaumont.
