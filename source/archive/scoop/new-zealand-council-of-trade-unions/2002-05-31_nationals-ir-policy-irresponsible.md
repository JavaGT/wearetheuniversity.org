National’s IR policy irresponsible

MEDIA RELEASE

National’s IR policy irresponsible  
in light of ERA success

“Outrageous claims made by employer representatives and some politicians when the Employment Relations Act became law have been proved absolutely wrong,” said Ross Wilson president of the Council of Trade Unions today.

A Department of Labour report released today has confirmed the ERA is working well, especially in terms of an improved mediation process to resolve issues.

“The report shows up just how irresponsible the National party’s recently released industrial relations policies are,” said Ross Wilson.

“They have said they will privatise the successful mediation service and that they will make substantial amendments to the Employment Relations Act.”

National has promised employers that they will be able to employ a new worker on an agreement that prevents them from taking any personal grievance in the first three months of employment.

“This means that an employer could employ a worker, of any age, and dismiss the worker, or allow them to be sexually harassed or subject to racial discrimination and yet be barred from taking a personal grievance,” Ross Wilson said.

"It is very disappointing to see the National Party say that despite the  
successes of the mediation service provided by the Labour Department and the  
use all workers are able to make of personal grievance rights, National will  
privatise the mediation service and remove grievance rights from thousands of workers."
