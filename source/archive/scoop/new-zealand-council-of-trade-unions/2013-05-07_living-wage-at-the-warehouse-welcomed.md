Living wage at The Warehouse welcomed

The Council of Trade Unions has congratulated The Warehouse Group and FIRST Union for putting in place steps for a living wage for retail workers at the company.

"Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders are living on substandard wages that make it impossible for them to fully participate in society," said Helen Kelly, CTU President.

"Alleviating the hardship faced by many families can only be addressed when we lift workers' wages to a living wage level and today's announcement is a big step forward for retail workers."

Helen Kelly said it was welcome that a large employer like the Warehouse could see the benefits of moving to a Living Wage, and it contrasted with Foodstuffs supermarkets Pak n Save and New World, who were isolating themselves as a low wage and youth rates employer.

"The Warehouse understands that by paying better wages, it will retain a loyal workforce and build a better business. Their work with FIRST Union to improve wages and conditions at the Warehouse is a very positive move."

"It is good to know that in an environment where the government is actively introducing laws to cut workers' pay and conditions and increase inequality that firms like The Warehouse can see the benefits of a moving to higher wage economy. Other firms should follow suit and consumers should support those that do so," Helen Kelly said.
