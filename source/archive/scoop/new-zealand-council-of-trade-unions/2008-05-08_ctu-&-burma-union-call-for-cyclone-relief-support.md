**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

  
Joint call by CTU and National Council for the Union of Burma for generous support to Burma cyclone relief

The President of the CTU Helen Kelly and the Director of the New Zealand Office of the National Council for the Union of Burma, Naing Ko Ko today jointly called on New Zealanders to give generously to Burma cyclone relief.

  
“This is a humanitarian disaster and we are asking all New Zealanders to donate to the disaster relief work already under way by the Red Cross and Oxfam," Helen Kelly and Naing Ko Ko said.

  
"The Council of Trade Unions has a close relationship with the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma which is part of the NCUB,” Helen Kelly said. “The FTUB has asked for our support on behalf of the people of Burma.”

  
“The Red Cross and Oxfam have assured us that they are delivering humanitarian assistance directly to the people of Burma who are in such desperate need,” Naing Ko Ko said.

  
Naing Ko Ko was a student leader in the 1988 student pro-democracy uprising in Burma who spent 7 years in prison. He has family in Burma who he hasn’t seen for more than 12 years.

Ends.
