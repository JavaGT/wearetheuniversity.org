Polytech Bill stifles workers’ voice

Polytech Bill stifles workers’ voice

The Education (Polytechnics) Amendment Bill which has passed its third reading in Parliament severs essential links that Polytechnics have with local communities and doesn’t recognise the knowledge that they have of their own communities’ educational and training needs, said CTU President Helen Kelly today.

“Workers have been represented on the governing boards of these institutions because of their knowledge of industry training needs and they play a critical role in ensuring links with industry and workers’ organisations,” said Kelly. “This legislation removes those representative positions. The outcome is going to be a real mess at the very time when the role of Polytechnics is critical in rebuilding industries and regions affected by the recession.”

“The Bill has been rushed through without any real analysis or understanding of the wider functions and relationships of Polytechnics. The Minister has listened only to selected advice from those whose primary interest is in business not education. Polytechnics will become corporatised bodies dominated by ministerial appointments in contravention of legislation and international obligations to maintain academic and institutional independence.”

“Polytechnics have a unique role in the tertiary education sector and are the largest vocational training providers in the country. Both workers and employers should have places on their governing councils and provide input about the issues that they know well to ensure polytechnics are responsive to the communities they serve.”

“The Bill also removes any guarantee of council membership for Māori, or other ethnic groups who may be prominent in the Polytechnics’ communities, showing further contempt for any idea of genuine representation.”

“What a sad irony that the legislation is due to be enacted on May Day next year, the traditional workers’ day. Instead of being heard the workers’ voice is being further stifled by a government that is deaf to anyone but its friends in the business lobby.”
