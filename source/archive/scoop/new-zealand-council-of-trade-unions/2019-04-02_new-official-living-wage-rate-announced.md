New Official Living Wage Rate Announced
=======================================

**Tuesday, 2 April 2019, 9:14 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

  
The CTU welcomes the updated Living Wage rate of $21.15 per hour.

The independently assessed rate is defined as being: ‘the income necessary to provide workers and their families with the basic necessities of life. A living wage will enable workers to live with dignity and to participate as active citizens in society.’

"We celebrate those working in the Living Wage Movement who ensure the vision of a living wage is a reality for thousands of working Kiwis. We also acknowledge those employers who have decided to pay those they employ a wage they can actually live on. These employers know that paying a living wage is the fair thing to do," CTU Vice President Rachel Mackintosh said.

"Since 2013 the annual Living Wage Rate has been reassessed each year. It is impossible to ignore the fact that today the minimum wage has increased to $17.70. So the difference between the living wage and the minimum wage is now $3.45."

"We encourage all employers to do the right thing and ensure that they pay their employees a wage they can live and flourish on," Mackintosh said
