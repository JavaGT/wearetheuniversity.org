Tell the Government: Don’t Cut Our Future! Budget 2011
======================================================

**Wednesday, 18 May 2011, 12:47 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

18 May 2011

### **Tell the Government: Don’t Cut Our Future! Budget 2011**

**When: Thursday 19th May from 12.15 – 1.00pm – (tomorrow, prior to the Budget being read)**  
**What:** Union and Community Budget Day Rally  
**Where: Parliament Grounds**

**Who:** Speakers include Helen Kelly (President of the CTU), Phil Goff, Metiria Turei, David Do (NZUSA), Alan Johnson (Salvation Army), Richard Wagstaff (PSA).

The rally will bring together unions, community groups and concerned individuals who have all said that cuts to social services and public services – like ECE and adult community education - is not the right approach to take at this time and will increase hardship, poverty, unemployment and tough times. We want the Government to know that there is an alternative to this approach. There will be 5-6 very short speeches from union and community leaders dispersed with some music, poetry and comedy acts.

ENDS
