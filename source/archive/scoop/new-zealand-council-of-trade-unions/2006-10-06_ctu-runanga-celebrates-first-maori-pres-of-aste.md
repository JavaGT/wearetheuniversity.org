CTU Runanga Celebrates First Maori President of Assn. of Staff In Tertiary Education

Te Runanga o Nga Kaimahi Maori o Aotearoa, NZ Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi joins the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) in their celebrations to welcome their very first Maori President Sharon Stevens.

“The election of Sharon is a significant and remarkable statement from ASTE Members who have declared proudly the value of Maori to the trade union movement, “CTU Vice President Maori Sharon Clair said today.

“It is exciting seeing gender inequalities addressed at the highest level of unions, as more wahine move into senior leadership positions,” she said.

“We look forward to strengthening Maori union activism through the dynamic and exquisite leadership that Sharon brings,” Sharon Clair said.
