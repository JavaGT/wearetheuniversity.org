Polytechnic Takes Provocative Action by Suspending Workers

The suspension of striking staff at Northland Polytechnic is a provocative action by the employer which will not help to resolve the dispute, Council of Trade Unions president Ross Wilson said today.

Hundreds of staff at six North Island polytechnics walked off the job this week in support of a pay rise.

Northland Polytechnic staff have not been offered any increase, and are now facing suspension.

“It’s bad enough that these workers haven’t been offered a pay rise, but now they are being suspended for trying to get a fair settlement,” Ross Wilson said.

The move will backfire on the employer, he said.

“It will consolidate community support for the workers, as well as support from the CTU’s affiliated unions representing almost 300,000 members.”

Tertiary institutions should be setting a good example as state employers, Ross Wilson said.

“They must make a decent pay offer and get back to mediation to avoid further disruption.”
