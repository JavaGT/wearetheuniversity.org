CTU critical of hard-line bus company

The Council of Trade Unions today criticised NZ Bus for implementing a complete lockout of all workers after just one hour of strike action.

"This is employer militancy against low paid workers and clearly the employer is hoping to starve these workers back to work," CTU President Helen Kelly said.

"The company is also ignoring the needs of thousands of commuters who are left completely stranded by this total lock out. I believe these commuters support the bus drivers and would be disgusted at the company's tactics."

Helen Kelly said that she hoped the parties would be able to get back into negotiations shortly to resolve the dispute.

"The company is offering a pay increase that will still mean these drivers earn close to the minimum wage. It is simply unsustainable and unreasonable."

"The CTU is campaigning for higher wages through continued increases in the minimum wage, more widespread collective bargaining and higher productivity through more capital investment per worker, skills development and improvements in workplace relations," Helen Kelly said.
