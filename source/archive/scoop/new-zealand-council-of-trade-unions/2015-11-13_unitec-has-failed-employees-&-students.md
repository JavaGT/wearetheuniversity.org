Unitec has failed employees & students
======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Council of Trade Unions](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Council_of_Trade_Unions)**

  
Unitec has failed employees & students

The Council of Trade Unions supports the 300 employees working at Unitec whose jobs have been disestablished in a decision made by Unitec’s chief executive, Rick Ede.

Unitec, New Zealand’s largest polytechnic, decided last week to take away the jobs of 300 people (about a quarter of their employees).

“These working people have spoken strongly about how students will pay more but get less support,” CTU Secretary, Sam Huggard said.

“Some of the people who will have had their jobs taken from them work in student services. Unitec intends to outsource student support to a private, for-profit call centre,”

“We know that this cost cutting decision threatens staff and students’ future,” Huggard said.
