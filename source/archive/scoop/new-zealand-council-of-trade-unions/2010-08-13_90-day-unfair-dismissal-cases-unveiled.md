90 Day unfair dismissal cases unveiled
======================================

**90 Day unfair dismissal cases unveiled in union campaign**

The CTU has published the first of a number of cases of workers unfairly dismissed under the 90 Day ‘Fire at Will’ law. Pharmacy worker Heather Smith was featured on national TV last night and a more detailed video of her experiences is now viewable at [www.youtube.com/NZCTU](http://www.youtube.com/NZCTU).

“Heather’s case will show people that anyone can be the victim of unfair dismissal under this law,” said CTU President Helen Kelly. “She had been employed without problem for almost three years at the pharmacy where she worked and was then dismissed within weeks of new owners taking over and forcing her to sign a new contract which contained a 90 day clause. As her story shows she did not think at the time the clause would affect her – but it did, and many other people will suffer like Heather if this law is extended to all employees.”

The CTU will publish details of further cases in due course and some of the unfairly dismissed workers will speak at rallies planned for next weekend.

Many more people are now speaking out on these proposed law changes. For instance, Erling Rasmussen, Professor of Work and Employment at AUT University, has described them as ‘a huge step backwards’.

“Many are now recognising that the Government’s employment law changes will disrupt many of the largely harmonious working relationships that have existed in New Zealand over the last few years. They undermine trust and respect in the workplace and will damage productivity, exactly the reverse of what the Government claims they are intended to achieve,” said Kelly.
