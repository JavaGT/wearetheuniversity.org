Komiti Pasefika calls on Kiwis to help tsunami victims

The NZ Council of Trade Unions Komiti Pasefika says the tsunami which has hit Samoa and Tonga is a tragedy for thousands of workers and their families both in New Zealand and overseas and is encouraging New Zealanders to donate generously.

Komiti Pasefika is the representative body for Pacific Island workers, representing over 60,000 union members across New Zealand.

Jerome Mika says

“The difficulty with this situation is the unknown, there are thousands of Pasefika families in New Zealand right now watching the events rolling out in the media and on Internet forums waiting to hear news about their loved ones.

“All Pacific Islanders understand the concept of family and how important it is to ensure families are provided for. There are many agencies who will be assisting with aid and Komiti Pasefika is calling on New Zealanders from all backgrounds to donate generously during this tragic time.”

The following agencies are taking donations to help tsunami victims in Samoa and Tonga:

The New Zealand Red Cross has launched a Samoa Tsunami Relief project at www.givealittle.co.nz.  
 

Oxfam NZ is accepting donations for their rapid response emergency fund online at www.oxfam.org.nz , by phone on 0800 400 666, or you can make make an automatic $20 donation by calling 0900 600 20.  
 

Foreign Minister Murray McCully also announced details of the Pacific Cooperation Foundation Tsunami Relief Fund. Deposits can be made at any Westpac branch.

ANZ Banking Group, has also set up an appeal to assist the families impacted by the earthquake and tsunami in Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga. Donations from New Zealand can be made at any ANZ Branch throughout New Zealand: ANZ Samoa Appeal Fund. You can also make a donation directly to the appeal account: account number 01 1839 0143546 00. All proceeds will go directly to the Red Cross to assist with the disaster response in the affected areas.  
 

Stella Teariki says

“For these organisations to be effective in helping flood victims the best form of assistance we can give is money.

“We would urge all union members to think about how they can assist our brothers and sisters in the islands through your own networks, communities and church groups.

“Komiti Pasefika is currently developing a plan on how we can assist more effectively and will provide an update on this as the situation develops.”

Ends.
