National Student Day of Action
==============================

**Tuesday, 12 August 2014, 10:02 am**  
**Press Release: [Reclaim UOA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Reclaim_UOA)**

National Student Day of Action

  
Friday 15th of August is a National Student Day of Action. Reclaim University of Auckland, Blockade the Budget and We are the University (Akl) are standing together against the corporatisation of the university. This Day of Action is held in conjunction with students in Wellington and Christchurch.

  
Student action has been an essential part of changes in discourse throughout New Zealand history. From opposition to apartheid to standing alongside Ngāti Whātua at Bastion Point, students from each generation have helped to push New Zealand towards becoming a more progressive society. This generation of students is defined by burgeoning debt, the lack of student and staff control over the university and our university’s academic co-operation with the oppressive Israeli regime. Seeking to combat this and reclaim the role of the university as the 'critic and conscience of society', students across the nation are coordinating a joint effort to regain control of our education.

  
At our day of action, Auckland students are asking where our university fees are going:

When more than one hundred jobs are being 'restructured' for admin staff through the Faculty Administrative Review (FAR)?

When our Vice-chancellor is the highest paid public official in Aotearoa, earning $660,000 per year?

When the University of Auckland is expected to become the first billion dollar tertiary institution?

When cleaners and other support staff are not paid a living wage or given secure contracts?

When academics are supporting colonial oppression and apartheid by publishing in partnership with Israeli academics and not supporting BDS?

When the politicians making austerity cuts to education received a fully funded tertiary education?

When the university doesn’t hold the NZ Police to account for [brutalising its students,](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1207/S00082/ipca-investigates-police-action-at-budget-protest.htm) or call out the IPCA for failing to respond to an official complaint after [two years](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1405/S00233/students-angry-about-lack-of-progress-on-ipca-investigation.htm)?

When the already minimal student, staff and community representation on University Councils is being undermined in favour of corporate interests?

When fully funded, fee free tertiary education is entirely possible?

  
If you want answers to these questions, join us on the 15th of August at 12pm at the University of Auckland Business School.
