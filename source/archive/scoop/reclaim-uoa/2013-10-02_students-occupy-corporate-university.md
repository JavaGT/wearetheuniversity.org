Students Occupy Corporate University
====================================

**Students Occupy Corporate University**

50 students are currently occupying the Campus Life offices at the University of Auckland in protest of the increased corporatisation and privatisation of university life.

This occupation erupted after a rally put on by the Tertiary Education Union and the Auckland University Students Association to discuss the corporatisation of the University and the need for a living wage on campus, academic freedom and eradicating student debt.

Students are concerned that the government views tertiary education as an export commodity and as a luxury for the children of the rich, rather than as a vital part of a functioning society and that this short-sighted approach is selling out New Zealand’s future.

Students hope that this action will create a space for discussion surrounding the way that tertiary education is funded and run in New Zealand.

Spokesperson Mikaela Hunt said “life on campus is increasingly being corporatised as the University shifts its focus to extracting profit rather than providing quality education and acting as the critic and conscience of society. ”

Campus Life receives the Student Levy which previously was given to AUSA to support students. Students pay over $12 million for Campus Life’s minimal staff while service workers at the University are paid minimum wage and students are crippled with debt.

Campus Life is one of multiple corporate satellites which surround the University of Auckland aiming to extract further funds from students and to use students to generate profit. This is part of a systemic corporatisation of the University.

Stuart McCutcheon receives $660,000 a year while service workers are paid minimum wage, all workers on campus deserve a living wage.

Students warn University management that they will not be silenced by their bureaucratic tactics and the crippling amount of debt that they increase each year.

Students will continue to occupy until student voices are heard.
