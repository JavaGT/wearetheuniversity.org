Lords Of The Extortion Rings

New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark says that the case of yet another Asian extortion ring in Auckland should act as a serious wake-up call for the Government to deal with imported crime.

“It is time this Government woke up to the fact that its open-door immigration policy automatically increases the likelihood of importing criminals – especially gangsters who prey on members to their own ethnic communities,” said Mr Mark.

“We have data which shows that on one day in Auckland District Court alone there were at least 24 immigrants who appeared on charges which involved extortion, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and assault with intent to rob.

“Immigrant crime is not just limited to Auckland. In Christchurch we frequently hear of reports where Asian students have had money extorted from them by members of their own community.

“The Government refuses point blank to acknowledge that the flood of immigrants and foreign students will lead to more of these types of crime which are more prevalent in certain cultures.

“The Government needs to take its head out of the sand and clamp down on imported crime,” concluded Mr Mark.
