Mr Bindra was born and raised in Mumbai, India but has made New Zealand his home for many years. He has extensive experience in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into society, and is a staunch advocate for providing high quality education to our youth.  
Mahesh is also heavily involved with the New Zealand Indian community, contributing vastly towards the Bhartiya Samaj Charitable Trust, Hindi Language and Culture Trust of New Zealand and Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO).

He is a trustee of Life Matters Suicide Prevention Trust and is deeply passionate about issues surrounding mental health care in New Zealand.  
Robert comes from a family of seven, with both his parents being doctors. This has given him a deep understanding of how our healthcare system works and what needs to be done to improve it.  
He is also an executive member of Young New Zealand First and was instrumental in the reformation of the Party’s policy around pill testing.  
Mr Griffith’s passion to help his fellow New Zealanders and his country makes him an ideal candidate for New Zealand First. We are excited to see him fly our flag in the Dunedin electorate.

We believe Mr Odering is the ideal candidate for the Waitaki electorate and look forward to seeing him represent NZ First values this coming election.
