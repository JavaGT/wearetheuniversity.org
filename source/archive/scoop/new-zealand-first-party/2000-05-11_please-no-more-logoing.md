Please: No More Logoing
=======================

**Thursday, 11 May 2000, 12:31 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

New Zealand First has welcomed a renewed emphasis on public service implicit in the name change sought for WINZ, but has urged the Department not to get involved in another round of corporate “branding.”

“It is a change of the organisation’s culture that is required, not a cosmetic and potentially costly name change. It is in all of our interests that public confidence in this organisation is quickly restored,” said Social Welfare spokesman Ron Mark.

“Please let us not have another round of logo designing, signwriting, stationery acquisition, Wairakei plane rides and assorted branding.

“The challenge for the Minister and his Government is to focus the department on assisting job seekers, paying the right benefits to the right people, and providing an efficient service to superannuitants, students, and other New Zealanders who require its services.

“This is a time for re-assessment, refocus, and consolidation - not for another round of re-structuring, re-branding and re-spending.
