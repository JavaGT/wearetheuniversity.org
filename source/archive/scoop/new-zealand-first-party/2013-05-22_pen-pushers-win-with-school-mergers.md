Pen Pushers Win with School Mergers

**Pen Pushers Win with School Mergers**

New Zealand First says “super-sizing” Christchurch schools will do nothing to improve education and will only create jobs for pen pushers.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says Education Minister Hekia Parata is failing to listen to schools and their communities yet again, by forcing Avondale Primary into a super school merger, when it strongly opposed it.

Avondale is merging with Aranui, High, Aranui Primary and Wainoni.

“There’s at least some good news for Chisnallwood Intermediate students , staff and community who can now put the merger anxiety behind them.

“But schools are emotionally worn out with months of worrying about what lay ahead for them. Today’s news that Aranui High, Aranui Primary, Wainoni and Avondale will form a super school will not end the stress and heartache.

“The schools now have 28 days to respond, but on past record, Avondale in particular may very well feel they’re fighting a losing battle.

“Big mergers make schools easier to run but are not in the best interests of students because they’re too big and impersonal and children can lose their sense of belonging.

“Super schools are great for administrators and bean counters but are not child-focused institutions,” says Ms Martin.
