Roulette Wheel Spins for Hospital Waiting Lists  

  
The Government is playing roulette with people’s health by spinning the wheel for hospital waiting lists, says New Zealand First.

“Today the media has highlighted a case of a woman who requires surgery, but she has been told she does not qualify for the waiting list,” says Spokesperson for Health Barbara Stewart.

“It is disheartening that the Government has set a test for the ‘level’ of need for surgery when clearly many thousands of people left off the waiting list are in dire need.

“In this case a woman has been told she only scored 60 out of 100 when 64 was needed to go on the waiting list.

“The many who do not win this game of roulette will be loaded up with painkillers and other drugs while waiting endlessly for surgery.

“While waiting to go on the waiting list their health will deteriorate and their quality of life will be compromised.

“By the time they get to surgery the toll on the health system’s dollars will be vastly more than if the surgery had been done much earlier.

“The National Government is using trickery to hide the true need.

“Even the medical profession is speaking out and questioning the management of the health system, pointing out that there is a hidden waiting list and saying doctors are frustrated by the constraints imposed by the Government’s targets,” says Mrs Stewart.
