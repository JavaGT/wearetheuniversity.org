Voice of Reason Calls for Halt to Immigration

**Voice of Reason Calls for Halt to Immigration**

New Zealand First’s call to stop the immigration avalanche is a voice of reason to reduce the Auckland housing bubble.

“It is not an attack on people coming to live in New Zealand. It is about reducing excessive demand on housing and jobs, and using immigration in a common sense way to benefit New Zealand when the times are right,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“There will always be detractors but the fact is the National Government is allowing runaway immigration, with over a thousand people coming here to live each week, and destroying the home buying dreams of New Zealanders, old and new.

“The excessive demand from immigration numbers, including speculators, should be enough to persuade anyone with a genuine interest in protecting Kiwi interests that it must be stopped.

“”Finance Minister Bill English claims the government is working on the housing crisis. It is not. He’s paralysed while the opportunity to immediately cut demand is ignored - cutting back on immigration, and offshore non-resident home purchases, and applying tax regimes to existing offshore, multi-house owners that many other countries apply.

“New Zealand should not be for sale to the world. We must put Kiwis first and allow them to establish homes and earn a living.

“And the government should stop blowing in the wind while it is doing nothing to reduce demand and little to help supply.”
