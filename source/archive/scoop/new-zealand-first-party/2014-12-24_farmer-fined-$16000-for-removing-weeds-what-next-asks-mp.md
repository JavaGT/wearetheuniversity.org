Farmer Fined $16,000 for Removing Weeds. What Next? Asks MP

New Zealand First Primary Industries spokesperson, Richard Prosser, will seek a ‘please explain’ from Local Government Minister Paula Bennett over the Waikato Regional Council prosecuting an award winning farmer for removing weeds and pest plants.

“As far as mad council decisions go, this has got to be right up there with the most stupid,” Richard Prosser says.

“An environmental award winning sharemilker, Bas Nelis, was raided by six council investigators and the Police because he was clearing a gully of pest plants before replanting it with natives.

“After spending tens of thousands of dollars to improve environmental outcomes by replacing pest plants with natives, Mr Nelis was arbitrarily prosecuted under the Resource Management Act, which common sense suggests, is clearly being misused.

“Mr Nelis’ environmental work has resulted in a $16,875 fine under the RMA for unlawful use of land and disturbing a riverbed – except that in this case – the so-called riverbed appears to be more of a drain from what I have been told.

“To the average person, having to seek permission to clear noxious weeds and pest plants on your own land seems insane, but that’s how pedantic and misguided things have become under this government.

“There’s genuine anger in the Waikato from farmers, former and current councilors, as well as from Federated Farmers. That tells me the council has stuffed it up big time.

“It is all symptomatic of “nanny-Natism” following as it does closely behind the $40,000 in fines handed out by WorkSafe NZ in Marlborough for non-compliance with quad bike helmet rules.

“New Zealand First is concerned that regional council enforcement officers may be throwing their weight around just because they can. They are being aided by an Environment Court which seems to have it in for farmers, given judgments like this.

“Maybe bureaucrats who do think this way should look for new jobs in somewhere like North Korea. This is New Zealand for God’s sake.

“The Minister for Local Government needs to rein this nonsense in and New Zealand First will be writing to the Ministers, Paula Bennett and Michael Woodhouse, to ask them if they think this is the optimum use of ratepayer money and Police time.

“I would suggest that this is a case where the Regional Council should take a step back, shut up, listen and learn, because here is a farmer doing the right thing. If anything needs to change they are the rules and attitudes of those enforcing them and not the actions of the man prosecuted.

“Having had communications with Waikato Federated Farmers, I plan to meet with them and Mr Nelis in the New Year because people like him need to be supported, not hauled over the coals,” Mr Prosser said.
