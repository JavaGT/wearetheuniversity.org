Ignorance Is No Excuse

Ignorance Is No Excuse

Four Chinese students and a Chinese New Zealand resident who avoided conviction for running an illegal casino operation, claiming that they did not know it was illegal, should be sent packing, said New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark today.

“The fact that the judge accepted that any conviction would affect their immigration status is just as appalling,” added Mr Mark.

“New Zealanders are sick and tired of hearing foreign offenders, overseas students and recent immigrants pleading ignorance of our laws or claiming not to understand English.

“When someone who is forbidden to drive kills another driver, and then claims he didn’t understand the meaning of ‘forbidden’, or when someone commits sexual offences blaming ‘culture shock’, they should be as liable under the law as anyone else. Instead, we just seem to roll over, accept their excuses and let them off,” said Mr Mark.

“Let’s get it straight – if people want to come to New Zealand they have to know, accept and follow New Zealand laws.

“If they can’t or won’t do that, let them go back to their own country and see if they get away with it.

“It’s time for this pathetically soft government to get tough and start kicking them out,” concluded Mr Mark.
