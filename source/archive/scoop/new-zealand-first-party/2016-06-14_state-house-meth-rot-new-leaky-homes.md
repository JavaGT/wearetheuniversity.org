State House ‘Meth Rot’ New ‘Leaky Homes’

State House ‘Meth Rot’ New ‘Leaky Homes’

Lack of action from the government to address the epidemic of meth contamination in our state houses has turned it into the new “leaky homes” crisis, says New Zealand First.

“More than a thousand state houses will show up as contaminated this year, according to social housing officials,” says New Zealand First Social Development Spokesperson Darroch Ball.

“Minster for Social Housing Paula Bennett intends to address the meth users and cooks by, ‘giving them the hard word’.

“This is a failure to acknowledge the level of ‘meth rot’ in state houses.

“Three months ago Deputy Prime Minister Bill English accepted that they needed ‘firmer measures’ but the number of contaminated state houses continues to sky rocket.

“From 28 houses found to be contaminated in 2014, it was 280 in 2015, and now over 1000 this year.

“With hundreds of honest families desperate for a state house, this level of blind apathy is outrageously irresponsible.

“New Zealand First calls on the government to get tough on meth using tenants.

“If they are caught contaminating their state house they should be kicked out for life, remain on a public register for seven years that will alert landlords, and be made to pay back the cost of repairing the damage.

“New Zealand First wants action now.

“This crisis is now affecting landlords and private property owners.

“The ‘leaky homes’ disaster will soon be joined by the ‘meth rot’ crisis,” says Mr Ball.
