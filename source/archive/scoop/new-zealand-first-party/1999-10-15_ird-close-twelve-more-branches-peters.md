IRD Close Twelve More Branches-Peters.

New Zealand First Leader, Rt. Hon Winston Peters, is shocked to learn tonight that the Inland Revenue Department has concealed plans to close 12 of its branches from a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry.

Mr Peters said the plans are a blow to thousands of people, who will be left without a localised service. He listed the branch closures as:

\- Blenheim  
\- Alexandra  
\- Henderson  
\- Central Auckland  
\- Panmure  
\- Lower Hutt  
\- Wanganui  
\- Masterton  
\- Porirua  
\- Riccarton and,  
\- Greymouth

"This slash and burn policy goes far beyond any of the 'minor changes' that we were promised by the IRD during the recent Select Committee hearings, and represents a total abandonment of the responsibility of both the IRD and Government to give honest answers to the Select Committee," said Mr Peters.

"The Commissioner should not be allowed to make these decisions in such a way.

"He has withheld vital information from Parliament and has therefore breached his obligations as a senior civil servant. Both Mr Holland and the Minister have some immediate explaining to do," said Mr Peters.
