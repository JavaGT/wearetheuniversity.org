Chinese Visa Fraud Requires Urgent Investigation
================================================

**Rt Hon Winston Peters**  
New Zealand First Leader

**Chinese Visa Fraud Requires Urgent Investigation**  
  
New Zealand First is calling on the Government to launch an investigation into the company contracted last year by Immigration New Zealand to process visa applicants in China.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says an investigation is urgently required following news that 231 people had falsely obtained New Zealand student visas through the Beijing branch of VFS Global Services.

“Taxpayers will have to pick up the bill for identifying and deporting those who cheated to get into our country, and are fraudulently enrolled in our education system.

“This is exactly the kind of problem created when you hand over a vital stage of border security to officials from foreign countries.

“The continuing bungling by the immigration service is inexcusable in a first world nation and the Minister needs to explain exactly what is going on,” says Mr Peters.
