**Simple Teacher Planning Equation Stumps Ministers**

The shortage of teachers in key subjects shows the government’s hands-off approach to education workforce planning isn’t working,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“Only a handful of maths and physics teachers graduate from New Zealand teacher training institutions each year and most of those are snapped up before they finish training,” says Mrs Martin.

“Many schools have to look overseas to fill key teacher positions.

“Why is the government burying its head in the sand and refusing to address this problem through simple planning?

“The government has failed to put measures in place to ensure schools can recruit high quality, New Zealand trained teachers in these subject areas.

“Minister of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce and Minister of Education Hekia Parata should do more to provide incentives for graduates to go into teaching.

“New Zealand First would prefer full government scholarships to train teachers in these subjects with a requirement to complete one year of teacher training upon graduation. This would be coupled with a dollar for dollar student loan write-off for teachers who stay and teach in New Zealand.

“That way, New Zealanders can give back to New Zealand by working with New Zealand students in New Zealand secondary schools.

“It’s not a difficult equation to work out but the problem won’t fix itself without simple workforce planning and incentives that will benefit teacher trainees, schools and ultimately students,” says Mrs Martin.
