Media Trivialise Crucial Election - Peters

Media Trivialise Crucial Election - Peters

  
Rt Hon Winston Peters has accused a number of media outlets of trivialising general election coverage to the point of mindless banality.

This follows a request from a Sunday newspaper for Mr Peters to discuss whether he owns an iPod and the type of music he likes to listen to on it.

Earlier Mr Peters had been asked about his pets and whether he would be interviewed cooking dinner for radio pensioner Paul Holmes.

“While the Western world lurches into economic meltdown, while tens of thousands of jobs are threatened, while a New Zealand company is embroiled in an international scandal, the media airheads are wandering off into cuckoo-land.

“If anyone ever thought for one nanosecond that the newspaper industry was into thoughtful and serious analysis of the issues facing New Zealand, my suggestion is that they should think again.

“The newspapers are generally lightweight ‘infotainment’ and publicity brochures for the National and Maori parties,” said Mr Peters.
