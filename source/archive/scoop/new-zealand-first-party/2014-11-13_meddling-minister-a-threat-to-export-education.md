Meddling Minister a Threat to Export Education

**Meddling Minister a Threat to Export Education**

Meddling by Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce has led to the poor performance of two public training establishments, which has been devastating for students, says New Zealand First.

“The government was warned in 2009, when it rushed through amendments to the Education Act 1989 under the guise of strengthening the governance of Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs), but Mr Joyce did not listen,” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“Now there is an investigation into failures at the Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki, including the delivery of the National Certificate and Diploma in Māori Performing Arts. This follows the $6 million debacle at Te Whare Wananga O Awanuiarangi over a tourism programme.

“The ITP council chairs told Mr Joyce there would be challenges for the Tertiary Education Commission in identifying a direct link between these council reforms and any improved institutional performance. Perhaps they should have been looking for the direct link between these reforms and the decline in institutional performance,” says Mrs Martin.

“To have this level of inadequacy in record keeping and attendance go unnoticed for five years beggars belief. Did the Tertiary Education Commission miss this because they were too busy scurrying around trying to keep Minister Joyce happy as he leaps from one uninformed decision to another? It puts one in mind of the saying “Nero fiddled while Rome burned.”

“This is another blow to New Zealand’s international reputation in education. The biggest threat to Export Education is this government and this Minister.

“The changes forced on the commission in 2009 are about to be pushed onto our universities with the Education Amendment Bill No 2. Once again almost 100% of submissions objected to these changes but Minister Joyce is overriding their collective wisdom just as he did in 2009. The students are left carrying the can.”
