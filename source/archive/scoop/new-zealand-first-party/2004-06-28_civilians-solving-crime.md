Civilians Solving Crime

Civilians Solving Crime

New Zealand First’s Law and Order spokesperson Ron Mark is shocked by Chief Inspector John Palmer’s admission that six non-sworn police staff attend to burglary complaints, and are in fact more experienced than graduates just out of police college.

“This highlights very clearly the total inadequacy of police resourcing. Despite Mr Hawkin’s insistence that New Zealand police are getting the support they need, police are sending civilian staff in place of sworn officers to investigate burglaries.

“Is the Government so reluctant to increase funding to allow police to catch criminals that they are willing to condone such an outrageous ‘solution’ to staff shortages?”

Mr Mark’s commments follow media reports this morning that roles taken by non-sworn police staff have escalated from administrative tasks to crime-scene investigation at burglaries in the Auckland region.

“This is yet another example of the Government unnecessarily endangering the safety of police staff to save a buck”, Mr Mark said.
