Public To Have Say On Universities Of Technology Bill

New Zealand First's education spokesperson Brian Donnelly says he’s very pleased that his Education (Establishment of Universities of Technology) Amendment Bill has been voted to select committee.

The Bill, which amends the Education Act 1989 and seeks to establish a new category of tertiary institution, a university of technology, arose out of New Zealand First’s Confidence and Supply agreement with the Government. It attempts to future-proof New Zealand’s tertiary education framework.

“The Bill recognises the importance of building and fostering relationships between business, industry and scientific research at a tertiary level. The establishment of a non-university class of institution for technology will provide scope to develop workplace skills and knowledge to a level comparable to overseas education providers.

"In addition, the Bill allows for students to move across various levels of tertiary education, with delivery of appropriate sub-degree programmes and pathways which allow them to progress to higher levels of education and training while pursuing their career goals.

"I am welcome this chance for the public and interested parties to have their say and I firmly believe that many will see the opportunity it provides for students to engage in research and practice in an environment that presents a variety of career opportunities for research and development expertise," concluded Mr Donnelly.
