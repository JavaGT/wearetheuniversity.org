Kiwi Parents Educational Views Ignored By The Government

**Kiwi Parents Educational Views Ignored By The Government**

New Zealand First says the Government is narrowing school curriculums to cover only academic outcomes while ignoring fully-rounded targets the community believe are important.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government’s Education Amendment Bill raises the concern that school Boards of Trustees will be severely limited in delivering what local communities believe are required for students.

“Every school has its charter consulted on with the parental community which sets the vision of student outcomes for individual schools.

“Parents across the country have indicated they want their children to become well-rounded members of our society which goes beyond a single academic measure.”

Ms Martin says the Government’s Bill creates a bureaucratic target with little concern for the overall wellbeing of children.

“It begs the question as to whether this Government recognises that creating well-balanced children is even part of the educational equation.”
