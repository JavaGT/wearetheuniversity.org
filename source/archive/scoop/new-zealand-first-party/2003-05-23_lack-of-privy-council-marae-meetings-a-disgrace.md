Lack Of Privy Council Marae Meetings A Disgrace

A decision by the justice and electoral select committee chairman not to hold a hui on various Marae to discuss the abolition of the Privy Council as New Zealand’s last court of appeal is a disgrace, said New Zealand First spokesperson Dail Jones.

He was commenting on the draft timetable for the committee which brings to a close the hearing of evidence at 7.00pm on Wednesday 28th May and for the next stage of the bill to commence that same evening.

“This is a gross insult to Maori who have asked for meetings to be heard on their marae and have been refused their democratic right by Labour, United Future and the Greens.

”It shows that the Government is determined to abolish the Privy Council regardless of the overwhelming opposition indicated by the submissions,” said Mr Jones.

“It is clear that a referendum shall be held on this matter but the Government is running scared on the issue and does not wish the people to express their view by way of referendum.”

Mr Jones said it was disgraceful that this major constitutional issue was being decided at the whim of an Attorney-General and Prime Minister who had decided during their university days that New Zealand should become a Republic.

“Neither of these people have ever had to make their way in the real world – and it shows,” he said.
