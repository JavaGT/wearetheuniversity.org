Student Loan Pay Off Needs Comprehensive Policy
===============================================

Student Loan Pay Off Needs Comprehensive, Not Ad Hoc, Policy Position

“The Government’s recommendations that student loan pay-offs would be used to settle junior doctor strikes is ad hoc and reactionary, New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly said today.

“What is needed is a comprehensive policy for student loan pay-off and golden handcuffing for all areas of critical human resource shortages.

“Patch ups here and patch ups there” will be the constant refrain from the Government unless it establishes a consistent policy in this regard.

“New Zealand First had such a policy in its 1999 Manifesto. The two parties, Labour and National, were so busy buying votes with simplistic policy promises before the last election, they failed to address the big picture with innovative policies.

“The Government is now left trying to pick up the pieces and is in danger of alienating thousands of other students with outstanding loans,” said Mr Donnelly.
