**Continuing Education Cuts in Northland Raise Concerns**

Another tertiary institution is being brought to its knees, thanks to the government’s ongoing funding cuts to the education sector, says New Zealand First.

“Whangarei-based polytechnic North Tech is set to lose $2.3 million in funding for programmes crucial for young people who leave school with few qualifications, and second-chance learners,” says New Zealand First Education spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“This comes the same week as The Design School in Whangarei announced it could close this year after having its funding slashed.

“The National Government is deliberately allowing public education to run down, in favour of private education in which profits are pursued over educational standards.

“The Government cutting funding to Level 1 & 2 courses in Northland, for example, ignores the systematic lack of investment in education for this region and its young people.

“The time to trim back these courses is when regional need has been identified, not when Wellington’s data stats are flat-lining across the country.

“This government appears to have no concern for the viability of public provision as they struggle to compete against private entities making a profit from the public purse in a "bums on seats" environment.

“New Zealand First's Up Front Investment Tertiary Policy would ensure that the right skills for New Zealand's future would be fully supported across the country with recognised regional input,” says Ms Martin.
