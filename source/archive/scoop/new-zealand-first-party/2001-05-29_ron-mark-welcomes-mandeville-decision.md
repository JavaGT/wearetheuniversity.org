**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

“As a resident in Waimakariri and local List Member of Parliament, I welcome the Government’s decision not to place a youth justice facility at Mandeville in North Canterbury,” said Ron Mark, New Zealand First spokesperson for Social Services.

“I would like to congratulate the Waimakariri Community Action Group for their dedication and hard work, as without them I am sure this decision would not have been reached.

“I would also like to acknowledge all MPs across party lines who lent their support to the work of the Waimakariri Community Action Group,” said Mr Mark.
