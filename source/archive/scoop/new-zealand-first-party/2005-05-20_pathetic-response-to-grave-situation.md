Pathetic Response To Grave Situation

New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark says police have been dealt a grim future by the Government which has failed to offer any substantial relief to the ailing Police Force.

Mr Mark has labeled the Budget provisions for police as pathetic and well below what is required to restore flagging public confidence in the force.

“The Minister knows that police numbers need to be increased by thousands, not hundreds, and if he serious about providing police with the resources they need to fight crime he would have sought ten times the number of extra officers he has promised.

“The Minister has again let down the police force and has offered only a sticking plaster solution to a seriously wounded organisation.

“It is also important to note that Mr Hawkins has not stated how many of the extra officers will be ring-fenced for traffic duties and how many will be assigned to the beat where they are most needed.

“There is no substitute for experience and until police are given the resources they need the exodus of our most experienced senior officers is set to continue.

“New Zealand First is the only party that can be trusted to double police numbers and ensure that the police force will have the frontline resources and powers to fight crime and keep our communities safe,” said Mr Mark
