Decile Review Reveals Rocketing Rate of Poverty

Government Caught Out as Decile Review Reveals Rocketing Rate of Poverty

  
New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin says the latest decile review is telling a story that the government doesn’t want to admit – the appalling rate of poverty in this country.

  
“The Ministry of Education’s figures reveal that next year, 8000 more students will be enrolled in low decile schools compared to this year,” says Ms Martin.

  
“What it shows is exactly what the teaching profession, the NGOs and New Zealand First has been saying – poverty is real and getting worse for children and families throughout New Zealand.

  
The response from Education Minister Hekia Parata is that the Government does not know why the recalculation has resulted in an unusual increase in the number of children in low-decile schools. “That beggars belief!” Ms Martin says. “It’s because these families are poor Minister! When will her government accept this reality?”

  
“New Zealand schools have produced outstanding academic results working in a complex and often underfunded environment and the latest decile ratings should be a wakeup call for the government.

  
“Mrs Parata has also announced that the government will investigate why this has happened. New Zealand First has the answer.

  
“Six years of a National government is what has happened to New Zealand and unless this government takes its head out of the sand this issue will only get worse.”
