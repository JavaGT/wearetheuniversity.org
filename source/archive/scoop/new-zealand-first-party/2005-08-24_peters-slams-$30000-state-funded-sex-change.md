Media Release

Peters Slams $30,000 State Funded Sex Change Operation

  
New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peter’s is outraged that 73 year old transsexual, Vicky Harvey, is able to secure a $30,000 state funded sex change operation when there are thousands of New Zealanders on waiting lists or with debilitating illnesses who are in need of urgent medical attention.

Mr Peters is responding to news that Vicki Harvey, Opunake’s most visible transsexual, is finally able to fulfil her life long dream of becoming a woman before she dies.

“Where is the logic in allowing a 73 transsexual with a confused gender identity, a $30,000 state payer funded sex change operation when last week I met a 15 year old girl with Cerebral Palsy who has not been able to get assistance with provision of a suitable wheelchair to enable her to actively participate in the community, asked Mr Peters.

“We urgently need to get prioritisation right in our health system so that the end result is better health for all those New Zealanders in genuine need.

“This means we need to put a stop to our already stretched health dollar being exploited by Labour’s gender bending support base,” said Mr Peters.
