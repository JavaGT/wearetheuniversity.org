National to Place Geographic Restrictions on Livestock Farming

New Zealand First says it is truly surprising that the National Government has decided to start telling New Zealand farmers where they can and can’t farm livestock.

Primary Industries Spokesperson Richard Prosser says the policy was announced by Environment Minister Nick Smith in Parliament on Thursday.

“New Zealand First Deputy Leader Ron Mark asked Minister Smith if he had seen a letter to Primary Industries Minister Nathan Guy, from the Waikato Land Users’ Group, outlining that the Waikato Regional Council’s Healthy Rivers Plan would lead to a ban on hill country farming in the Waikato region, at a cost to the farming sector in that region of over a billion dollars,” Mr Prosser said.

“The minister’s response was: ‘It is true that there are parts of New Zealand where there will need to be limits on intensified farming if we are serious about improving fresh water quality.’

“I was frankly quite stunned by the minister’s response.

“Either the National Government has consulted with the farming sector and confirmed that they’re happy about that, or Mr Nick Smith has just gone and put his foot in it.

“Does that mean that existing farms are going to be bought out, or closed down, or forced to switch to something other than sheep, beef, dairy, and deer?

“Becoming more green than blue is a truly surprising move from the National Party, and I’m further surprised that the traditionally National-supporting farming sector is so relaxed about it, presuming of course that they have actually been consulted.

“New Zealand First is fully supportive of practical, workable measures to protect the environment, of the type that farmers and regional authorities are already undertaking, but we haven’t ever contemplated dictating to cockies what they can farm and where they can farm it.

“It’s just another indication that the established political ground continues to shift beneath our gumboots,” Mr Prosser said.
