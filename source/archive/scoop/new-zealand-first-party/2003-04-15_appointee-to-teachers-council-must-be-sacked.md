Mallard’s Appointee To Teachers Council Must Be Sacked Says New Zealand First

  
“Pem Bird, a Ministerial appointee to the New Zealand Teachers Council, must be sacked from that body for his part in an enrolment scam,” claims New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“The New Zealand Teachers Council is the body which has been established to set professional standards for principals and teachers. Currently it is devising a Code of Conduct for educational professionals.

“The scheme in which Mr Bird was involved was designed to defraud the taxpayer and gain funding for students to which they were not entitled.

“Mr Bird’s claims that the students were not formally on his school’s roll is clearly incorrect. He claimed those pupils as being at his school on his roll return which, he, as principal, must have signed off. He would also have known that those children were not in attendance at his school.

“His denial that these children did not receive any funding is also questioned as the Ministry had informed him a week ago that they had.

“Are these the standards we want for our educational professionals,” asks Mr Donnelly. “I think not. If Mr Mallard does not take the appropriate steps he will be seen to be condoning such behaviour.”
