Media Release  
17 October 2003

Open Day At Rolleston Prison

“The news that a murderer with convictions for sexual offences against children is on the run and the manager of South Island Prisons is ‘concerned’ has all of Canterbury concerned at the continuing ineptitude of Corrections Management,” said New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark.

“Low morale amongst prison officers led to staff leaving and now the prisoners are walking out too,” said Mr Mark.

“This latest breech of security will inevitably lead to an internal investigation and another round of butt covering.

“How can we have any faith that this new investigation will differ from previous ones that have highlighted basic management failures and resulted in no significant changes and little accountability.

“While we are being reassured with comments about this killer being a low risk to the community, the facts are that he re-offended when on earlier parole, he has now escaped and the police have warned that he should not be approached.

“This incompetent prison management need to be made accountable for this latest and potentially dangerous breech,” said Mr Mark.
