No compassion for kiwis with cancer

**NO COMPASSION FOR KIWIS WITH CANCER**

Kiwis living overseas who have cancer and are struggling with student loans will get no compassion from the government, says New Zealand First.

“They are getting treatment overseas yet the government is not willing to write off any interest from their student loans to alleviate their financial stress,” says Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart

“Minister of Revenue Todd McClay has told New Zealand First that nothing can be done because there is no provision to write the interest off within the law.

“But the government found a way to change the law and added an additional flag choice to the referendum,” says Mrs Stewart.

“The Minister’s response and last week’s announcement that Kiwi cancer sufferers need to prove their ill health every month to receive financial support shows just how out of touch the government is.

“Kiwi cancer sufferers deserve our compassion and support when they are at their most vulnerable, yet compassion is something this government is severely lacking,” says Mrs Stewart.
