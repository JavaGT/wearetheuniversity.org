**Tertiary Students Deserve Better From the Government**

New Zealand tertiary students continue to be treated like second-class citizens, according to a recently released survey, says New Zealand First.

“The New Zealand Union of Student Associations Income and Expenditure survey highlights the serious plight of our students and the real impact the government’s tertiary policy is having, says New Zealand First EducationSpokesperson Tracey Martin.

“New Zealanders constantly hear that our young people are our future, our best and brightest. Under the current user pays education system we are burdening our future with debt and forcing our best and brightest overseas to the highest bidder,” says Ms Martin.

“We congratulate NZUSA for releasing this report. Without the constant voice of the NZUSA President, Rory McCourt and Executive Director, Dr Alistair Shaw, the government’s harsh approach to tertiary education could go un-noticed.

“New Zealand First rejects the current model that requires students to borrow to live. This limits opportunity and access and imposes a mortgage on the future of both our students and our nation.

“This is why, as New Zealand First’s Education spokesperson, I have worked closely with NZUSA for the last four years around policy creation. I am pleased to see that almost all of the recommendations from the Survey are already New Zealand First policy, and included in our [manifesto](http://nzfirst.org.nz/sites/nzfirst/files/manifesto_2014_final_version_3.pdf).

“We will continue to work with Mr McCourt and Dr Shaw to ensure the plight of our students don’t go unheard by the government,” says Ms Martin.
