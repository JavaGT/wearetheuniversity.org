Prisons Again Proving Unsafe

Spokesperson for Corrections

**Prisons Again Proving Unsafe**

The latest attack on a prisoner in Auckland is evidence that taxpayer money could be better spent in Corrections facilities, says New Zealand First.

“The fact that another prisoner has been left injured after an attack in one of New Zealand’s maximum security corrections facilities clearly indicates a problem,” says Corrections Spokesperson Mahesh Bindra.

“Every time a violent incident takes place, there is this rehearsed line 'violence will not be tolerated' but clearly nothing is done because it keeps happening.

“The Government spends over a hundred thousand dollars of taxpayers' money per prisoner per year in the maximum security environment.

“New Zealanders need to know that their tax is put to good use and in the Corrections portfolio this accountability sits with the Minister, Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“New Zealand First believes that our corrections facilities should be safe for both prisoners and staff.

“Corrections staff need the tools to be able to do their job and this is where taxpayer funding should be spent.

“If the Minister can’t ensure safety for both prisoners and staff, he should step up or stand down,” says Mr Bindra.
