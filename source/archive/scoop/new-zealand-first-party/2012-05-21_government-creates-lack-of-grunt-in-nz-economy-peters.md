Government Creates ‘Lack of Grunt’ in NZ Economy – Peters
=========================================================

**Monday, 21 May 2012, 12:50 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**Rt Hon Winston Peters**  
New Zealand First Leader  
21 May 2012    
   
**Government Creates ‘Lack of Grunt’ in NZ Economy – Peters**  
   
New Zealand First says this week’s slash and burn budget will rip the heart out of the country and deliver a bleak future for ordinary New Zealanders.  
   
Rt Hon Winston Peters told the AGM of New Zealand First’s Wairarapa branch today in Masterton that the biggest threat to our country is the lure of Australia.  
   
“About 1000 Kiwis a week, many of them qualified in trades, are quitting our country.  
   
“This loss of tradespeople is ripping the heart out of our economy and creating a serious lack of grunt for future growth.”  
   
Mr Peters says the blame can be put fairly on the shoulders of the unprincipled National Party.  
   
“This position also goes for National’s three Klingons on the political starboard bow – the Māori, United Future and ACT parties. This is politics John, but not as we know it.  
   
“They are selling state owned assets, privatising schools and the social welfare system, allowing prime farming land to be sold to foreigners.  
   
“They are letting currency speculators, financial gurus, and money jugglers get away with economic murder while ignoring the plight of ordinary New Zealanders.  
   
“They are failing to create jobs for thousands of graduates who head to Australia to earn higher wages to pay back enormous student loans.”  
   
Mr Peters says National’s dead-end policies will unfortunately gain impetus in the Budget.  
   
“When the economy tightens up is not the time for the Government to cut and plunder at will. That has never worked in the past and is doomed to failure.”
