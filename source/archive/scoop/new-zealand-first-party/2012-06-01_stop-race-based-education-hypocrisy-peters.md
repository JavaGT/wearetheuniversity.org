Stop Race-Based Education Hypocrisy – Peters
============================================

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader

**Stop Race-Based Education Hypocrisy – Peters**

New Zealand First has accused the Government of creating a race-based, two-tier education system which disadvantages the majority of New Zealand kids.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says there is a lack of transparency around the fact that class sizes will increase in mainstream schools but not in Māori immersion schools.

“If smaller class sizes for Māori language immersion is intended to get better results then that should be the case for the remainder of the education system in which 80 per cent of Māori are enrolled.

“If it makes sense for Māori immersion but not for mainstream schools then Prime Minister John Key and his Education and Finance ministers are guilty of hypocrisy.”

Mr Peters says even the National Party does not believe its own spin that class size doesn’t impact on student learning.

“It is a true-blue double standard created by National to ensure it retains the support in Parliament of the Māori Party.”
