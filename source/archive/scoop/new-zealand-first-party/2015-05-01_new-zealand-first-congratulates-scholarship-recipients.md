**New Zealand First Congratulates Scholarship Recipients**

New Zealand First would like to extend its congratulations to this year’s recipients of the Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Awards.

They are: Tahlia Kingi (Te Arawa, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti), Te Rerekohu Tuterangiwhiu (Ngāpuhi, Taranaki, Ngāti Ranginui, Tainui), Hine Kawana (Rangitane, Raukawa, Te Arawa, Ngā Waiariki, Te Ati-hau-nui-a-Papārangi), Coralie Takuira Dargaville (Ngāpuhi, Te Rarawa) and James Enright (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Ruanu).

The Ngarimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarships are bestowed upon outstanding Māori who through a combination of their academic studies, leadership and community-minded spirit have worked to benefit Māori.

“These scholarships have been awarded to talented Māori as recognition of their desire to make a difference within their communities,” says New Zealand First Māori Affairs Spokesperson Pita Paraone.

“It is with warmth that New Zealand First congratulates this year’s five recipients and looks forward to seeing their innovative ideas for Maori flourish into the future,” says Mr Paraone.
