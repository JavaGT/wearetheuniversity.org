Pacific Education Needs More Support

**Pacific Education Needs More Support**

New Zealand First supports the call from the New Zealand Principals’ Federation for greater resourcing to meet the needs of Pacific learners in the classroom.

“The Principals’ Federation says it is not ‘obvious how to apply (the Ministry of Education’s Pasifika Education Plan) to raise achievement for Pasifika children at the individual school level’.

“Once more then, we see the Government is paying only lip service to the issues facing Pacific students,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Pita Paraone.

“In reality, teachers are not being provided with the necessary training to engage with Pasifika children as per the Ministry’s plan of ‘focused programmes’.

“New Zealand First supports the Principals’ Foundation and calls on the government to invest further in teachers and equip them with the knowledge and understanding necessary to deliver the government’s own strategy to increase Pasifika achievement,” says Mr Paraone.
