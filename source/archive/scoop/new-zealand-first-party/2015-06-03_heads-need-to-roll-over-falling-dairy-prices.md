Heads Need to Roll Over Falling Dairy Prices

**Heads Need to Roll Over Falling Dairy Prices**

With the first GlobalDairyTrade auction of 2015/16 continuing a losing streak, New Zealand First wants to know if Trading Among Farmers (TAF) is part of the government’s review.

“Farmers won’t be happy to see [the first GlobalDairyTrade auction for the 2015/16 season](https://www.globaldairytrade.info/en/product-results/) pick up where the final auction for 2014/15 left off,” says Member of Parliament for Northland and Leader of New Zealand First Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Dairy farmers are right to be worried given the 2015/16 season [will leave farmers with massive overdrafts](http://www.dairynz.co.nz/news/latest-news/support-for-dairy-farmers-ramped-up/). The milk price outlook will not correct until tit-for-tat sanctions in Europe end but the government is showing no leadership in the UN on this.

“Given the government is reviewing dairy industry competition, New Zealand First wants to know if the failed Trading Among Farmers experiment forms part of that review.

“The National government [foisted Trading Among Farmers onto Fonterra](http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/business/6535599/Best-policy-is-leave-farmers-in-charge) and it has been a disaster given legislation forces Fonterra to subsidise Chinese companies with cheap milk when they set up in New Zealand. This puts Fonterra’s milk supply base at risk by incentivising farmers to cash out.

“Leaders like [Morris Roberts](http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/business/6962461/Share-trading-dangerous-path) warned then Primary Industries Minister David Carter that National’s meddling would end in tears while [Simon Couper](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/6987381/Shareholder-council-chairman-praised) was so concerned he quit as Shareholders’ Council chair. Today, heads need to roll at Fonterra and within government for this legislative mess,” says Mr Peters.
