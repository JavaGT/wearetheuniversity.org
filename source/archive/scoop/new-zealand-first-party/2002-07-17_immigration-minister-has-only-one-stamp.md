Immigration Minister Has Only One Stamp

“Immigration Minister Has Only One Stamp – Peters”

  
“After learning of my concerns about the ability of immigrants to buy bogus jobs to obtain residency in NZ, the Minister of Immigration Lianne Dalziel has said I should hand over the evidence” said Rt Hon Winston Peters, Leader of New Zealand First and MP for Tauranga.

“Why would I want to do that, (although I gave it to the Media)”, asked Mr Peters today.

“The last time I went to this Minister with details about an outrageous immigration scandal which included misrepresentations by a Fijian national, who arrived in New Zealand using fraudulent papers, who had a number of convictions, who set about to defraud New Zealanders of hundreds of thousands of dollars, not once but twice, who is currently again in prison for further fraud offending, what did Minister Dalziel do? Did she send him packing? NO. She did precisely NOTHING!  
she said she was not prepared to discuss individual cases”.

“This highlights the ridiculous and impotent state some of our departments have become under direction of soft and ineffective Ministers”, said Mr Peters.

“It is my belief that the Immigration Minister has only one stamp on her desk, and that’s APPROVED”, concluded Mr Peters.
