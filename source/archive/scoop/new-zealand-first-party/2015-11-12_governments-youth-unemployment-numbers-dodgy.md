Government’s Youth Unemployment Numbers Dodgy

  
Facts and statistics are being twisted by the government to convince the public that youth unemployment is dropping, says New Zealand First.

“It is unacceptable for the government to manipulate youth data to cover up their failure,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Social Development Darroch Ball.

“The rate of youth either not in employment, education or training was much lower before National became government.

“Seventy-two thousand young people are now not in employment, education or training; that’s an increase of 6000 under the National government.

“It is high time National put in meaningful policy to support youth instead of continued investment in ineffective programmes.

“National is short sighted in its cost-cutting of funding for top quality youth programmes like the Limited Service Volunteers - despite the programme showing excellent long term outcomes for young people.”
