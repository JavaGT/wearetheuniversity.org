Polytechs Merger Shortchanges Regional Students

**POLYTECHS MERGER SHORTCHANGES REGIONAL STUDENTS**

Regional New Zealand is taking another hit from the government with the merger of Aoraki Polytechnic in Timaru and Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology, says New Zealand First.

“For Timaru students, there is now uncertainty about what courses will be provided locally and how students will be supported,” says Spokesperson for Education Tracey Martin.

“Instead of encouraging regional growth the government is doing the opposite. Minister for Economic Development Steven Joyce talks about ‘Canterbury wide’ benefits but his decision is at the expense of the smaller city of Timaru.

“This is the type of decision that has led to stagnation of regional New Zealand in the past.

“Maintaining a spread of tertiary educational institutions across New Zealand with their local economic spinoff, is crucial to reinvigorating the regions.

“But the decision of the Minister announced yesterday totally ignores the links between training institutions, local industry and the ability of the local polytechnic to fit courses around occupational opportunity in the area.

“The merger has also left some Aoraki staff worried about their jobs.

“While domestic tertiary student numbers are falling, statistics also show that the trend will be reversed and communities will demand tertiary education options close to home.

“New Zealand First believes that anyone looking at the long term provision for regional education should be concerned by the implications of all polytechnic mergers,” says Mrs Martin.
