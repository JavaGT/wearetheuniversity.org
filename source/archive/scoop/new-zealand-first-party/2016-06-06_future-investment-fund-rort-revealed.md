Future Investment Fund Rort Revealed
====================================

**Monday, 6 June 2016, 1:02 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland

**Future Investment Fund Rort Revealed**

National promised the proceeds of assets sale would be spent on schools, hospitals and roads but we’ve been cheated, says New Zealand First.

“They betrayed New Zealanders by using the now depleted Future Investment Fund, built by controversial asset sales, as nothing less than a slush fund, says the New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The Prime Minister promised $1 billion to modernise and transform schools by 2016 but he’s cheated schools by $212 million.

“National has not built a millimetre of the Puhoi to Wellsford motorway but has closed the Napier-Gisborne Line and has is shutting down Northland rail.

“National spent $41.1 million from the fund on the Mighty River Share Loyalty Bonus Scheme and the Genesis Initial Public Offering Bookbuild. How many houses could that have built?

“The Prime Minister told Parliament last year that this fund was being used to buy ‘assets that are long-lived, are here in New Zealand, and are owned by the Crown on behalf of all taxpayers’.

“So how is $23 million for the Passports Memorandum Account, $12.5 million for the RealMe on-line authentication and verification service, $23 million for New Zealand’s World Bank Subscription and $7.9 million preparing for the 2018 Census, a road, a hospital, a school or even, an asset?

“How can the Prime Minister justify raiding this fund for $4.4 million for the Cabinet’s new document management system or $6 million to modernise the War Pensions Act 1954 and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act?

“It is clear National treated this asset sales fund as a slush fund to underwrite its sleight of hand surplus. The purpose the National Party gave the public for these sales was simply propaganda on which they should be held to account.”
