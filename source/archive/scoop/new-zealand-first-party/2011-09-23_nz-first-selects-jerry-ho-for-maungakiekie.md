Rt. Hon Winston Peters  
Leader NZ First

**NZ First Selects Jerry Ho for Maungakiekie**

New Zealand First has selected Jerry Ho as the candidate for the Maungakiekie electorate. Mr. Ho is an accomplished businessman currently completing his Masters in Business Administration (MBA) at Auckland University to compliment his Post graduate Information Technology Degree from the Auckland University of Technology as its candidate.

Jerry works in the Employment Sector in Auckland assisting New Zealanders to secure sustainable and meaningful employment. In his spare time Jerry is a renowned concert pianist who has played at a number of international venues such as the iconic Australian Opera House.

Jerry represents a new breed of exciting and multi-talented Politician that has decided to enter into New Zealand politics with New Zealand First. Jerry’s decision to stand for New Zealand First is simple “New Zealand First puts New Zealanders first, whether you’re Asian, Pacific Islander, European or Maori.” Said Jerry.

A passion for economic development and sound foreign investment Jerry is also keen to promote New Zealand First’s immigration policy as he strongly believes it is in the best interest of New Zealand and all New Zealanders.

“We are delighted to have someone of Jerry’s calibre carrying the message of New Zealand First,” says Mr. Peters.
