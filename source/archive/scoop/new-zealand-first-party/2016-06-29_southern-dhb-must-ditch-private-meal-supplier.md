Southern DHB Must Heed Public And Ditch Private Meal Supplier

With winter biting, the Southern District Health Board (SDHB) needs to ditch its private meal supplier and start providing nutritious quality meals cooked at local hospitals for patients and the elderly, says New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill, Ria Bond.

“The quality of the food being dished up by Compass at the coldest time of the year is appalling and inadequate for what people require.

“A petition being circulated in Southland with thousands of signatures shows the degree of concern on this matter and if the SDHB had any concern for the people’s health they would dump the contract they have with Compass Group immediately.

“The SDHB was the last DHB to join this Compass mess and it’s time they got out of it, especially when claims that savings are being made are highly questionable,” Ms Bond says.
