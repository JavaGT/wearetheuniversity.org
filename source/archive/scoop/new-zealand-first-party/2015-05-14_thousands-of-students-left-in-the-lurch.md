Thousands of Students Left in the Lurch

Thousands of Students Left in the Lurch with Illogical Rule Changes  

  
“Badly thought out rule changes by Education Minister Hekia Parata are letting down thousands of teenagers with learning difficulties,” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader Tracey Martin.

“Students needing the most help, including those with dyslexia, now won’t quality for assistance such as reader writer aids and extra time in exams,” says Mrs Martin.

“The Minister is allowing the New Zealand Qualifications Authority to strip students of access to Special Assessment Conditions (SAC) if their reading level doesn’t match their age group.

“It will be impossible for many special needs students to attain the vital qualifications they need to move ahead.

“Why is the Minister putting obstacles in front of students instead of helping them to achieve their potential?” asks New Zealand First.

“This is a step backwards and disappointing for all those dedicated to helping this group,” says Mrs Martin.

“New Zealand First would work with the sector to urgently review the SAC criteria so all those who need support, including digital solutions, have access to the help they need.

“The Education Minister gets a huge fail mark for this initiative which is yet another setback for students with learning difficulties and their parents.”
