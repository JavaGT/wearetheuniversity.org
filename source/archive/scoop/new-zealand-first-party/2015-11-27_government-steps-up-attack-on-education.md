Government Steps Up Attack on Education

Spokesperson for Education

**GOVERNMENT STEPS UP ATTACK ON NEW ZEALAND EDUCATION**

Minister of Education Hekia Parata is having a busy week – closing schools one day and announcing large changes to the delivery of education in New Zealand on another,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

"New Zealand First recently attended one of the Minister’s farcical consultation meetings on what she has termed the most significant change to the Education Act since Tomorrow’s Schools. It was clear to anyone attending this meeting that the consultation process is just a charade for the Minister and the National government.

“The Minister has now announced the introduction of another education bill that has had no student, parent or sector input.

"Many of the changes suggested in the Education Legislation Bill 2015 sound like they have come straight from the Business Roundtable and reinforce the message that sending parents off to work is more important than how we shape and deliver the very best education for children.

"Having a principal manage more than one school shows what this government really thinks and how little they really understand about the vital role the educational leader has inside every individual school and community.

“Couple this change with the move to allow tertiary institutions to sponsor charter schools and we have another example of profit making and market driven education policy.

“New Zealand First will argue for young New Zealanders at the Education Select Committee despite it being weighted with National Party backbenchers,” says Mrs Martin.
