**Government Flouts High Court Ruling Over Salisbury School**

New Zealand First says it is unacceptable that the Government has ignored a High Court ruling to keep Salisbury School open and instead is trying to shut it through dodgy backdoor politics.

Disability Issues spokesperson Barbara Stewart says this year Salisbury School has a record low number of pupils which is all down to the Government’s behind-the-scenes meddling.

“The Ministry of Education has received more than nine applications since September that could have boosted role numbers had they not been declined.

“The special needs students that attend Salisbury School need the stable social and learning environment it provides.

“Instead they are going to place these young girls education in jeopardy by forcing them into mainstream schools. That is unfair.”

Mrs Stewart says the Government won’t even listen to Salisbury School, having declined the chance to visit the school and hear their ideas.

“All this Government cares about is money. They need to start heeding the High Court ruling and look after the futures of deserving young New Zealanders,” says Mrs Stewart.
