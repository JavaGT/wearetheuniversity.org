UNITEC - Right Decision But For Wrong Reasons

  
Today’s decision by the Education Minister not to grant University status to Unitec was the right decision, but was made for the wrong reasons said New Zealand First Education spokesperson Brian Donnelly.

“It is clear that New Zealand does not need another University, “ said Mr Donnelly.

“What is required is the establishment of a new category of tertiary institution – a University of Technology.

“Such a category would offer qualifications with a parity of esteem with those offered by a University.

“New Zealand first has long been asking the Education Minister to pursue this option but he has been largely dismissive of the idea.

“It seems rather absurd that Auckland University of Technology (AUT) was granted University status when Unitec was declined, despite it being by and large the same type of institution,“ concluded Mr Donnelly.
