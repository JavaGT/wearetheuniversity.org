GDP Figures a Long Way From Reality

GDP Figures a Long Way From Reality

Ordinary Kiwis will wonder what all the fuss is about over GDP and claims it is strong growth for this country, says New Zealand First.

“Talk of New Zealand expanding economically at 3.6 per cent sits uncomfortably beside the reality – hospital queues, garages as homes, people moving out of Auckland because housing is unaffordable and stagnant incomes,” says New Zealand First Leader and MP for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Thousands of Kiwis working in two or three casual or part-time jobs won’t get any relief from the GDP figures.

“They’re competing for work against a record influx of immigrants, ironically one of the drivers of GDP – more people, more consumption. That’s exactly why the National government clings to the open door policy. With population growth at 2% the GDP is misleading.

“As we have already pointed out it is a bogus picture of economic success.”
