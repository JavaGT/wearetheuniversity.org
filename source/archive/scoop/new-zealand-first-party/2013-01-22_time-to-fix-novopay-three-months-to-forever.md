Time To Fix Novopay – Three Months To Forever

**Time To Fix Novopay – Three Months To Forever**

New Zealand First is concerned by the Ministry of Education’s acceptance of errors and the amount of time it’s taking to fix Novopay.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says this change of tactic by the Education Ministry from assuring school staff they are doing everything they can to get them paid correctly, to now confirming they are expecting future problems, indicates they are seriously concerned about the integrity of the Novopay system.

“This admission appears to be an attempt to abdicate all responsibility for fixing this flawed system,” says Ms Martin.

“Oracle Consultants and IT specialists say the Novopay core billing engine issues are presenting thousands of variables which require an overwhelming range of rule exemptions.

“To minimise the negative variables will not be a quick fix and these technicians suggest that this could take anything from three months to forever.

“Blatantly placing the blame on school administration staff whose total professional development of a maximum five online seminars (webinars) prior to launching Novopay live across the nation reeks of desperation by Talent2 senior management.

“To launch Novopay into a high risk environment without a full real-life trial or backup plan was irresponsible with the Ministry even stating it was one of the most complex payrolls in Australasia.

“What is more difficult …creating a real-life trial or all this drama?” says Ms Martin.
