Celebrating 50 Years Of Independence in the Cook Islands  

New Zealand First congratulates the government and people of the Cook Islands as they celebrate 50 years of self-government.

“Cook Islanders are New Zealand citizens and it’s important to acknowledge our close ties,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Pita Paraone.

“New Zealand and the Cook Islands share a relationship that dates back to 1901, and the bond continues to be strong 114 years later. We have over 60,000 Cook Islanders living and working in New Zealand, and they contribute a great amount to our society.

“Thousands from New Zealand, Australia and throughout the Pacific have travelled to Rarotonga to show their support, including New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“New Zealand First has always pushed for fair treatment of New Zealand citizens living in the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. We will continue to support common sense measures for our close Pacific neighbours.

“Again we extend our congratulations to the people of the Cook Islands and wish them all the best for their celebrations,” says Mr Paraone.
