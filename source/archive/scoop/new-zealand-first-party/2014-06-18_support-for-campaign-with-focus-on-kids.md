Support for Campaign with Focus on Kids

Tick for Kids, the campaign that challenges political parties to focus on children and their welfare, is supported by New Zealand First, says Spokesperson for Family Affairs Barbara Stewart.

“New Zealand First is committed to fighting to protect our social fabric and traditional family values. These underpin our society and are crucial to the wellbeing of Kiwi kids,” says Mrs Stewart.

“Our policies will provide economic growth that will lift the living standards of families, with a resultant flow-on effect to children.

“New Zealand needs a more diversified economy that will lead to more jobs. Increasing employment opportunities will benefit thousands of families – when Mums and Dads have a fair income their children will benefit.

“We will remove barriers so that everyone who needs assistance has easy access to social service providers so all children have a chance for a good start in life.

“We agree with the campaign’s slogan that ‘It takes a child to raise a country’, and we want a healthy upbringing and good education for all young New Zealanders,” says Mrs Stewart.
