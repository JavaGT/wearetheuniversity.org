Immigration Department And Minister Lack Competence

  
Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland  
22 October 2015

  
Immigration New Zealand should be mortified that over 1200 Filipino farm workers have managed to undermine the integrity of our immigration system, says New Zealand First.

“This immigration scam highlights the appalling mismanagement of our visa application process, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“A Waikato-based Filipino woman has single-handedly shown how incompetent Immigration New Zealand is, and it should come as no surprise under this National-led Government who are heavy-footed on immigration matters.

“This individual has managed to gain commercial benefits from falsifying documentation - proving just how inept the Department and Minister of immigration are.

“Under this National-led Government, there have been over 3000 complaints of immigration fraud from 2009 to 2013. The shameless Department and Minister have poorly mismanaged our visa application system which has allowed people to live and work here illegally.

“New Zealand First has consistently questioned National’s open-door immigration policy and the effectiveness of the Department to try and prevent instances like this from occurring again!
