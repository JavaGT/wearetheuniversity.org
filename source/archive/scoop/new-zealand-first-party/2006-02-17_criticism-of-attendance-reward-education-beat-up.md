Criticism of Attendance Reward Another Education Beat-Up

New Zealand First Education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly has congratulated Wellington High School for its initiative in aiming to improve school attendance.

'Opportunity to learn' strongly influences student achievement and sustained truancy can lead to significantly diminished opportunities in later life.

"By making these awards the school is proclaiming to its student body that attendance is important. Research on this issue is unequivocal - engaged academic learning time is a significant factor in learning outcomes," said Mr. Donnelly.

“In a country where (in September 2002) almost 12% of secondary school students were absent on any given day it is entirely appropriate that our schools focused their attentions upon this factor of engaged academic learning time,” said Mr Donnelly.

“Rather than beating up on Wellington High, we should be applauding its recognition of the importance of attendance and conveying this to its student body,” concluded Mr Donnelly.
