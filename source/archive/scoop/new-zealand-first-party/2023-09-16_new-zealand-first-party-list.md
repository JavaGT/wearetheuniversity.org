New Zealand First is proud to announce the Party List for the upcoming 2023 General Election.

We have had a great number of applicants and potential candidates moving through the selection process over the past few months.

Our final selection for our list proves we have a wide range of highly qualified, skilled, and experienced New Zealanders who have put their hands up to represent our Party and New Zealand.
