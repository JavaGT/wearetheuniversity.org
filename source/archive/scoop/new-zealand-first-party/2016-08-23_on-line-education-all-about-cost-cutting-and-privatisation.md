On-Line Education All About Cost Cutting And Privatisation

**On-Line Education All About Cost Cutting And Privatisation**

Education Minister Hekia Parata wants to start shifting students out of schools and to online education – and no doubt has private providers in mind for her new scheme, says New Zealand First.  
“This will be a huge and tragic social experiment on our children,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“We foresee students attempting to learn online in the hands of unqualified supervisors because the government believes ‘anyone can teach’.

“No one asked for this – neither educators nor parents. It will be about money making for private enterprise.

“Children and their families will be big losers, and the nation will suffer as the standard of education suffers.”
