Goon Squad Findings Reveal Serious Management Flaws

  
Official reaction to the coroner’s report on David Haimona’s death is shameful, says New Zealand First Corrections spokesperson, Ron Mark.

“The findings of this report adds further weight to the urgent need for a full and independent inquiry into what is going on in Canterbury prisons,” said Mr Mark.

“Weak and flawed leadership across all levels of management has led to a series of disasters in the region’s prisons with the worst outcome for David Haimona and his family.

“At the time, Paul Monk knew what the goon squad was doing, yet he did nothing. Inactivity continued through to ministerial level with the minister of the time, Matt Robson, failing to order an investigation.

“Following this week’s conclusion to the shameful escapades of the so-called emergency response unit, these men are once again silent. So too is the current Corrections Minister.

“It seems David Haimona’s unnecessary death will be largely ignored by the those who were responsible and had the power to prevent it.

“An inquiry into Canterbury’s prisons is well overdue and I hope Mark Gosche has the will to deal with the crisis in Corrections,” said Mr Mark.
