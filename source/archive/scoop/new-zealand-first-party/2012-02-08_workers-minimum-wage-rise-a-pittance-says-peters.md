Workers Minimum Wage Rise A Pittance, says Peters
=================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
Leader NZ First

**Workers Minimum Wage Rise A Pittance, ays Peters**

New Zealand First describes the fifty cents an hour minimum wage rise as an insulting pittance.

The minimum wage will increase from $13 to $13.50 an hour and the training and new entrant minimum wage will increase from $10.40 to $10.80.

New Zealand First says the minimum wage should be at least $15 an hour.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says the skinflint wage increase will not even cover power price rises let alone the rise in the cost of food items.

“This is the government that gave huge tax cuts to its rich mates.

“Remember the boss of Westpac got more than five thousand dollars a week in tax cuts while the workers had to pay higher GST on the cost of everything to pay for these tax cuts.

“New Zealanders who believe in a fair go know this government has one set of privileges for the rich while the poor slide further into poverty.”

Mr Peters says all the parties that form the government should feel ashamed, especially the Maori Party.

“Everybody knows that National has a callous disregard for workers but the Maori Party claims to stick up for Maori people on low incomes.

“The reality is the gap between rich and poor is growing all the time and the Maori Party is just as guilty as National,” says Mr Peters.
