**Lower Dollar Boosts Dairy Auction But Makes Our Farms Cheap**

The welcome surge in global dairy prices, like that of wool recently, has nothing to do with government policies but it now leaves our farms at the mercy of cashed up foreign buyers.

“That 9.4 per cent rise in GlobalDairyTrade comes off the back of the dollar’s fall and growing concerns about milk supply due to drought,” says the New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Not that this government is doing much on water storage and it‘s done nothing to drop the dollar. It has only come down due to the policies of other governments.

“But look what happens when our dollar does fall against the greenback. The value of our exports rise and that’s great for tourism, IT, dairy, wool or beef.

“The Prime Minister and his minions believe everything is awesome so we don’t need a register of foreign land ownership. The Prime Minister is like Nero and is fiddling while our exporters burn, our land is being sold and then there’s Mike Sabin.

“It is basic economics that a lower dollar boosts the value of our exports and it is basic reality that if we don’t own our productive assets then the value of “our exports” simply head offshore. This is called economic sovereignty.

“Thankfully, New Zealand First has a Bill to bring in a register of foreign ownership awaiting introduction,” says Mr Peters.
