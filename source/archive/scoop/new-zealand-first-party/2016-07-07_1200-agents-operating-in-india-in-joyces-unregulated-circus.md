1200 Agents Operating in India in Joyce’s Unregulated Circus

The government has to sort out the crooked education agent crisis in India, the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Steven Joyce admitted in Parliament.

“The fact is the Minister does not have a handle on this huge problem of corruption at all and it’s of the government’s own making,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“Mr Joyce said about 1200 Indian agents approve students for study in New Zealand. He neglected to mention they are unlicensed and there is massive capacity to tarnish New Zealand’s image and reputation.

“It’s an unregulated, cowboy industry with commission paid agents preying on naïve students desperate to move here. National only sees dollar signs.

“Immigration New Zealand weeded out at least 57 corrupt Indian education agents but there would be dozens of others among the 1200,” says Mrs Martin.

“Mr Joyce claimed the international student industry is robust and that the government is enforcing robust monitoring of the policy - the Education Code of Practice 2016 that came in on 1st July.

“Under the code New Zealand institutions must ‘carry out and record reference checks on potential agents to ensure as far as possible they have not been involved in any conduct that is false, misleading, deceptive, or in breach of the law’ and that they ‘ensure those agents provide international students with reliable information and advice about studying, working and living in New Zealand’.

“International Education is New Zealand’s fifth largest export sector and with the underfunding by the government it is now vital to the health of our education sector. New Zealand First believes at the very minimum all overseas agents must be licensed.

“We would prefer New Zealanders licensed as agents working overseas or using the digital technology available for face to face interviews.”
