Errors Do Not Help Local Government Elections

Andrew Williams MP  
Spokesperson for Local Government

**Errors Do Not Help Local Government Elections**

“Thousands of residents may have been put off voting in the Christchurch local government elections because of an error in the pamphlet telling people how to vote,” says New Zealand First Local Government spokesperson Andrew Williams.

“This is yet another instance of a mistake or omission made in official papers. The election information pamphlet states New Zealand citizens are eligible to vote, but does not mention that New Zealand residents are also entitled to vote.

“It was only because an astute Christchurch candidate, Dr George Abraham, noticed this glaring mistake that the error was picked up halfway through the three week postal voting process. The incorrect pamphlets have been withdrawn by electoral authorities.”

“Voter turnout at local body elections was already dismally low at around 40 per cent. We cannot afford misinformation to exclude migrants who are New Zealand residents and are legally entitled to vote for their local representatives.”

Mr Williams says incompetent errors have been made with voting papers and information in many parts of New Zealand, which undermines the democratic process and he lists a number of them.  
• In Wellington the council had to cover the cost of posting a correction to every voter in the Southern Ward when it misspelt a candidate’s name.  
• In Auckland there were up to 18 pages missing from the candidate profile booklets in some areas. The council has decided not to correct these errors.  
• In Hamilton a mayoral candidate is demanding an apology and retraction after an incorrect statement was printed about him.  
• In the Waikato district some candidates have been left out or listed as standing in the wrong ward.  
• In Hastings a referendum on fluoride was missed from hundreds of voting paper packs.

“Councils and electoral officers are dismissing these as ‘printing errors’ but there are financial and democratic costs to ratepayers and candidates for slack administration of this election.

“We are a first world country and deserve far better,” says Mr Williams.
