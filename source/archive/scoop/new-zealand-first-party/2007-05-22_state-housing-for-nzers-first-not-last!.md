State Housing For NZers First - Not Last!

State Housing For New Zealanders First - Not Last!

New Zealand First wants the Housing Minister to explain why immigrants are being allocated State houses ahead of New Zealand citizens.

Housing spokesperson Pita Paraone today released figures showing the numbers of non-New Zealand citizen applicants granted a State house over the past three years:

2003/04: 1444, 2004/05: 1481, 2005/06: 1508.

Mr Paraone pointed out that New Zealand takes a total of 750 refugees each year and that the Minister stated today that only 150 refugee families were housed in 2005/2006.

“That leaves 1358 migrant families, who presumably arrived under points systems, being granted State houses while thousands of New Zealand families wait on a list.

“We don't dispute the needs of genuine refugees but we do question the fairness of a situation where immigrants, who are supposed to have passed the test of their worth to our country, being allocated State houses while New Zealanders wait. The Minister thinks that a permanent resident is a New Zealander but the last time I checked a New Zealander had not only residency but citizenship as well.”

Mr Paraone says that Housing New Zealand does not record the citizenship status of current occupants of its properties.

“Officials only record it at the time of application. It is never revisited. They don't actually know how many foreigners live in subsidised State housing at any one time.

“There are more than 11,300 families currently on the waiting list for State housing. Why should desperate New Zealanders wait while migrant families are housed first?”

“From the Minister's response in the House today it appears that any migrant can go into a State house after two years – ahead of Kiwis who have lived here all their lives,” said Mr Paraone.
