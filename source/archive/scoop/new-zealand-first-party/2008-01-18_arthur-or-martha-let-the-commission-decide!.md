Arthur Or Martha? Let The Commission Decide!

  
The Human Rights Commission’s latest nonsense on the rights of so-called ‘transgendered’ people is another example of the creeping insanity of social and sexual engineering, says New Zealand First Deputy Leader Peter Brown.

“New Zealand First will strongly oppose any attempts by the Labour Government to adopt the recommendations of the report,” said Mr Brown.

“Just because technology physically allows a person’s sex to be changed, it does not mean that society should be forced to accept the results, or pay for them.

“The report cites issues relating to ‘transgendered’ children at school. Of course children should feel safe, but they do not need pressure or encouragement from fringe liberals to wear drag to school.

“Further, we should not be condoning these liberal attempts to ‘transgender’ children either. Teenagers find it difficult enough to make basic decisions about life and should not be burdened further with having to choose between wearing male or female clothes.

Mr Brown said that the Human Rights Commission had shown its usual separation from reality over what was really a fringe wish list.

“What is even more disgraceful is that the commission has spent 18 months and tens of thousands of dollars studying a non-issue that affects a tiny minority.

“The commission should curb its obsession with sex and find something more useful to do with its time,” said Mr Brown.
