New Zealand First is challenging the Government to better help the country’s talented digital game developers as New Zealand takes the limelight at an international conference.

Communications and IT spokesperson Tracey Martin says as game developers from around the globe this week gather in San Francisco for the annual Game Developer Conference, it is inspiring to see our game developers up there with the best in the world.

“A recent Education and Science Select Committee – Digital Literacy Inquiry – heard about a dire shortage of students studying digital coding.

“There are fantastic international opportunities for New Zealanders in this industry and we should seize upon the opportunity to develop this field.

“The Government needs to step up educational and financial support for the development of the industry with a nationwide scholarship.

“The inquiry also identified that we must develop our own educational games so that our children continue to sound like New Zealanders.

“I congratulate New Zealand’s gaming developers who are receiving international recognition in San Francisco this week, after producing six games which hit the top 10 in the iOS downloads charts in the US last year.” says Ms Martin.
