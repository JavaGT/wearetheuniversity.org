New Zealand First Bill Proposes Major Health System Benefits

New Zealand First Bill Proposes Major Health System Benefits

Parliament today will vote on a New Zealand First bill that will make major cost savings in the public health system.

“The [Affordable Healthcare Bill](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/bill/member/2015/0056/latest/whole.html) will create fairness – after all, it is the long suffering taxpayer who funds it,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“It would require health insurance for immigrants on parent reunion visas, give tax relief to employers participating in workplace health, and give a 25 per cent rebate for SuperGold card holders with health insurance.

“The Bill requires parent reunion category visa migrants to maintain health insurance for their first 10 years residency in New Zealand. Eighty thousand migrants over 50 years of age have settled in New Zealand in the past 15 years, with full rights to use the public health system.

“The Bill removes fringe benefit tax from employers who provide workplace health insurance.

“The Bill has a SuperGold 25 per cent rebate on average health insurance premiums to stop the leakage of people with private health insurance returning to the public system.

“All Members of Parliament who want to alleviate pressure on the public health system and be fairer to Kiwis who have contributed to the economy should vote to support this Bill,” says Mr Peters.

The first reading of the Bill will be completed and voted on in Parliament today.
