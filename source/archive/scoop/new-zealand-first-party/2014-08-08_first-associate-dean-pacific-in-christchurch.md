**FIRST ASSOCIATE DEAN PACIFIC IN CHRISTCHURCH**

New Zealand First Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Asenati Lole-Taylor is pleased to see positive leadership by the University of Otago in announcing their first Associate Dean Pacific for Pasifika health sciences students in Christchurch.

“I would like to congratulate Dr. Kiki Maoate on his appointment to the new position,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor. “He has gained valuable experience in his career as a specialist paediatric surgeon in the Canterbury region and across the Pacific, and I am sure he will have plenty to teach our young students coming through.

“It is very encouraging when busy professionals like Dr Maoate make time to give back to their local communities by sharing their wealth of experience.

“I am sure he will be a fine leader like his father, the late Sir Terepai Maoate, former Prime Minister of the Cook Islands.

“I would like to offer my best wishes and full support to Dr Maoate as he embarks on this journey to lead our Pasifika students toward academic success,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
