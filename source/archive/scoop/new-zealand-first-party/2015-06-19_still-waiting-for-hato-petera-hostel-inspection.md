Still Waiting For Hato Petera Hostel Inspection

Still Waiting For Hato Petera Hostel Inspection

New Zealand First is calling on the government to explain why it has not inspected the appalling hostel at Hato Petera College.

“Last year in Parliament Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye said there would be ‘an inspection of that hostel in the next couple of months’.

“We understand this has not occurred.

“New Zealand First recently visited the hostel and we were speechless at the conditions the students live in. Quite frankly, the smell of the place was dreadful.

“As Winston Peters said, it was like going back to Dickensian times.

“The Associate Minister also said six months ago she was aware of the issues ‘that have been raised around the hostel’.

“When will the Associate Minister and Minister visit the hostel to see the conditions for themselves and take action?

“It’s time for the government to face up to its neglect. It has responsibility for all New Zealand students, they cannot turn away from Hato Petera by saying it is an Integrated School. They got involved with bailing out Whanganui Collegiate which is now an Integrated School. The local member of Parliament, National Minister Jonathan Coleman, is also ignoring the students’ plight.”
