The people have spoken
======================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

  
Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland  
24 MARCH 2016

The people have spoken

Whichever way we voted the people have spoken and we should unite behind our flag as one people, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Kiwis gave the alternative flag a chance tonight in no uncertain terms.

“All credit to the thousands who turned out to prevent change – they were determined not to be a push over.

“Why they voted with such a strong voice is no doubt linked to historic reasons and the $26m cost, with many believing it should have gone on more worthy causes.

“While we respect the views of the many who voted for a new flag, it was not to be.

“The idea came out of left field with the Prime Minister telling us we wanted a flag change and we liked the silver fern, all without any costing being done.

“But the PM refused to be hands off. The process was manipulated from the start with a compliant flag panel choosing decisions to the PM’s liking. Mr Key even got the alternative flown on the Auckland Harbour Bridge, paid for by his own department and the Ministry of Transport.

“Even the voting paper was not immune to the government’s influence with the alternative being placed above our official flag.

“Whether this was the time for a flag change or not, it did not come about because the PM’s handling of it ensured the result we got tonight.”
