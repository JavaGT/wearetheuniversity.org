NZ First Gains Concessions For School Staff

New Zealand First Gains Concessions For School Staff

“New Zealand First gained a significant concession for school staff during the committee stage of the Education Amendment Bill,” New Zealand First Education spokesman, Hon Brian Donnelly claimed today.

He said, “As the Bill was written, teachers and other staff members at a school would have had no priority right for the enrolment of their children at the school. New Zealand First won the support of the House for an amendment providing such a priority right for teachers. The Greens subsequently broadened the motion to include all employees of the Board.

The important issue is that the Bill now recognises the commitment of teachers and other school staff members to the well-being of the students, and the fact that school staff do not leave the grounds when the last bell of the day rings.”
