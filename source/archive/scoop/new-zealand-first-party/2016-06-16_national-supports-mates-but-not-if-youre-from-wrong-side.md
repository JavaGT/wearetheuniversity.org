National Supports Mates, But Not If You're From Wrong Side
==========================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**Rt Hon Winston Peters**

New Zealand First Leader

Member of Parliament for Northland  
16 JUNE 2016  

**National Supports Mates, But Not If You’re From Wrong Side Of Tracks**

The government is prepared to look after its mates, but ignored recommendations for compensation to Teina Pora, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“We have a Minister of Justice who thinks she knows more about fairness than Rodney Hansen, former High Court judge, so the Cabinet ignored his recommendations.

“The government’s mean-spiritedness to Teina Pora contrasts with its entitlement mentality and desire to only look after their own – such as the $1.6 billion payout to South Canterbury Finance, the $67 million to Warner Bros and the $42m a year in benefits to SkyCity.

“The government should admit the system has once again failed Teina Pora, and the Minister should use her discretionary power to offer more compensation.

“The Minister has chosen to hide behind her leader who believes the Crown doesn’t have to pay Teina Pora anything,” Mr Peters said in Question Time in Parliament today.
