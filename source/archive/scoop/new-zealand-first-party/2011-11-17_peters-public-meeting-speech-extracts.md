Peters: Public Meeting Speech Extracts
======================================

**Thursday, 17 November 2011, 2:24 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY**

  
**Rt. Hon Winston Peters**

**Leader NZ First**

**Address:** Public Meeting

**Date:** November 17 2011

**Time:** 2pm

**Venue:** Invercargill Workmen’s Club

**Extracts from a Speech**

**‘Exporting and New Zealand’s Future’**

**‘What National is not telling You’**

• Southland the great export province

• 3% of the population, 16% plus of the exports

• How National respects you

• How ‘Federated Farmers’ has deserted you

• What Southland could do about it

• The petulant walkout happened ironically at the Federated Farmers meeting in the ‘Farming Capital’ of NZ - Wellington

**The Smiley’s People**

When Key and Banks sat down for a cup of tea last Friday the smugness was oozing out of them.

O what a lark! The peasantry, in the form of the media scrum, were firmly in their place – on the outside looking in. The media were reduced to fawning onlookers with their noses pressed against the window - gazing in on awe as the great ones met.

Who did Key and Banks think they were?

Napoleon and Tsar Alexander meeting at Tilsit!

If you sat down in a café or restaurant and there was a black pouch on the table what would you do?

Of course you would take it to the counter

That is what decent people do

But Key and Banks did not do that simple act for one reason

They were enchanted.

They were enchanted with each other – and the bit of political theatre they had contrived.

Contrived with a capital C!

Now the New Zealand public can now see what a pair Key and Banks really are

Self-important – Manipulative – Insulting and dismissive of a large number of New Zealanders

The ancient Greeks had a word for what was present when Key and Banks met –hubris - what we would call arrogance.

And hubris, as the Greeks understood, is a fatal flaw that leads to disaster and ruin.

The real significance of the ‘cuppa-gate’ fiasco is that it shines a long overdue light on John Key’s judgement

• On character

• On trust

• On credibility

• On how he sorts out political problems

• On what a John Key political deal looks like for Don Brash

The conversation covers what Banks thinks of Brash and how Key confirms that view.

The conversation also covered restructuring and rebuilding of the Act Party and John Key telling Banks who the new Act Leader should be and, Winston Peter’s ‘constituents are dying’ is a description Key uses of hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who happen to be older.

And equally alarming is his belief the percentage of the vote that National will get on Election Day will enable him to govern alone.

John Key has been found wanting

And the New Zealand electorate has been warned in time to take the action at the ballot box.
