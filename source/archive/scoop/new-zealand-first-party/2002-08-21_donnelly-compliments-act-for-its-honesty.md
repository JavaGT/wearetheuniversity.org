Media Release

  
Donnelly Compliments Act For Its Honesty

“The line-up of spokesperson roles announced yesterday by ACT reflects the party’s educational policy,” said NZ First MP, Brian Donnelly.

‘It is to be noted that Donna Awatere-Huata has been allocated the responsibility for compulsory education only. Tertiary and pre-school education portfolios are absent from the line-up”.

“The reason for this is clear – ACT does not believe that there should be any state funding for these areas of education”.

“The ACT party needs to be complimented for its honesty. It hasn’t allowed itself the fiasco of listing a spokesperson for areas which it does not believe there should be any state involvement,” said Mr Donnelly.
