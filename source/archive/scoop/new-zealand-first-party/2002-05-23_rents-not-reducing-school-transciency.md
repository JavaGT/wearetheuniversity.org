Income Related Rents Not Reducing School Transciency

“Evidence is emerging that government claims that its income-related state housing rental policy has had no effect on reducing school transciency,” NZ First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly said today.

“The movement of students from school to school is recognised as a significant factor in education disadvantage and is seen by educationists as a serious problem. “

“The government has claimed that its housing policy has severely reduced transcience. Research based evidence by the Child Poverty Action Group would indicate that the government’s claims are not accurate.”

“In its response to the select committee’s report on the teaching of reading in NZ, the government said it would initiate work on this issue. These recent findings add urgency to the need for more direct strategies to address these problems”, Mr Donnelly said.
