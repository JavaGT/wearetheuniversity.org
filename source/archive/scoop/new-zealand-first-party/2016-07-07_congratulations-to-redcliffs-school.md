**Tracey Martin MP**

Spokesperson for Education  
7 JULY 2016  

**Congratulations To Redcliffs School**

New Zealand First congratulates supporters of Redcliffs School for their tenacity in the fight to prove that bureaucrats don’t always know best,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“The principal, Board of Trustees, staff, students, parental community and residents refused to accept the flawed logic presented to them by the Minister.

“They went above and beyond to provide accurate evidence-based data showing that they should be allowed to reopen their school.

“This is people power at its best. Well done!”
