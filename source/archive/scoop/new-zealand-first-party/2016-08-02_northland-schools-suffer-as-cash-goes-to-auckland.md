**Northland Schools Suffer as Cash Goes to Auckland**

  
Northland schools are being forced to suffer as education funding is sucked up by Auckland, says New Zealand First leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

  
“A newspaper article (_Northern Advocate_, August 2) has revealed 12 Northland primary schools have more students than teaching space and are having to use kitchens and hallways as classrooms.  

“While some Northland schools have been waiting years for classrooms, two months ago the government announced $153 million would be invested in school property in Greater Auckland which followed a quarter of a billion dollars being spent to upgrade and grow Auckland schools over two years.

“In June the Ministry of Education said a new school would be built and 16 new classrooms developed in Northland.

“It’s time they started delivering on this as well as addressing the chronic lack of teaching space,” Mr Peters says.
