Loan Amnesty A Positive Move - Donnelly

New Zealand First Education spokesperson Hon Brian Donnelly has welcomed the changes to the Student Loan scheme announced today aimed at encouraging New Zealanders to return home.

The Government is proposing a three year amnesty on student loan penalties for students and graduates who have headed overseas to encourage them to come home. Travellers will get a three-year "holiday" on student loan repayments, though the debt will still attract interest.

“New Zealand First has always been of the opinion that the best immigrant is the returning New Zealander and we will welcome any moves to encourage New Zealanders to return,” said Mr Donnelly.

“Many of those who have ventured overseas with a student loan neglected to fully read the fine print before they departed and have been so shocked with the penalties imposed by Inland Revenue that their loan has become a barrier against their return to New Zealand.

“We applaud the intent of this legislation and I look forward to working closely with it through the Select Committee process to ensure we have a final product which realises this intent,” said Mr Donnelly.
