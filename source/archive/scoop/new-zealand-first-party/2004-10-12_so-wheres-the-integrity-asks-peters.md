So Where's The Integrity? Asks Peters

New Zealand First is calling on all councils to reappraise their voting systems to help restore voters’ faith in the democratic process at local level.

“Continuing evidence of non-performing election process systems, three clear days after Saturday’s midday vote closure, requires not just a full inquiry, but an examination of the problems posed by STV voting processes,” said local government spokesperson Jim Peters.

“The present problems may be matters of resourcing, but the uncertainty in councils from Matamata-Piako to Dunedin City and the Chatham Islands has resulted, apparently, in thousands of votes not accounted for.

“Ratepayers and citizens have every right to expect that voting systems have integrity and certainty. Mixed papers have ensured mixed results, leaving some results suggesting that those listed first alphabetically had a greater opportunity for election.

“Local democracy should be better served than the shambles dished up last weekend,” said Mr Peters.
