Minister Slow to Get into the Driving Seat

  
New minister Simon Bridges will have to pick up speed if he wants to go the distance on transport matters, says New Zealand First.

“In Parliament today, when asked questions about the development of commuter rail services, the Minister could only say he’d ‘have to check’, says New Zealand First Transport spokesperson Denis O’Rourke.

“Disappointing, but on the subject of railways, not surprising given the National Government has been running down rail for six years.

“When asked what new lines would open, he mentioned there had been some spending on upgrades and electrification in Auckland and Wellington.

“But when questioned on extending the diesel commuter train service south from Auckland to Tuakau and Pokeno he found the ‘level of detail’ too much, and asked for the question in writing.

“With funding already set aside by the Waikato District Council for a new station, there is an urgent need for the service to be extended as a means of getting an initial commuter link into Waikato, where housing costs are much cheaper than in Auckland,” says Mr O’Rourke.
