Minister Should Apologise To Supergold Cardholders
==================================================

**Friday, 1 July 2016, 12:32 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**Rt Hon Winston Peters**

New Zealand First Leader

Member of Parliament for Northland  
1 JULY 2016  

**Minister Should Apologise To Supergold Cardholders**

Minister for Senior Citizens Maggie Barry must apologise to SuperGold Cardholders for forcing them to change over to a different travel card.

“This is a dictatorial approach and even worse, has been handled so badly thousands of people are still unsure if they have the right pass for buses, trains and ferries.

“She should also apologise for the cost – there has been a massive last-minute campaign to make today’s July 1 deadline for the switch to a gold Auckland Transport HOP card – but it failed.

“This was a government directive to all operators providing the free off-peak SuperGold Card travel – but now the Minister is trying to blame Auckland Transport for the mess.

“We are now told there has been a month’s extension to the deadline – so today Auckland Transport is accepting the SuperGold Card, the blue HOP card with the SuperGold Card concession loaded or a similar gold HOP card.

“What an appalling state of affairs allowed to happen under the Minister for Senior Citizens and intended to be repeated around the country.

“It is not Auckland Transport that is to blame, but rather she and her government. And frankly, she should be replaced as the Senior Citizens Minister. It’s no wonder the Trans Tasman Government Department Reviewdescribed her as a ‘weaker minister’.”
