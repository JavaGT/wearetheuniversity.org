Urgent Steps Needed To Ease Student Loan Debt

New Zealand First has suggested urgent action to address student loan debt which has exploded to $4.75billion with serious implications for the future.

Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said New Zealand First would promote a private member’s bill to introduce a universal student allowance and also promote loan abatement schemes.

“We will continue to insist that that the appropriate ministries study the impact of student debt, which will have disastrous economic and social consequences.

“We will continue to force changes to our immigration policies to stop temporary residents ripping off our education system.

“While our finest young people are disappearing overseas to avoid the millstone of their debt, more places are being taken in our professional schools by foreign-born students whose parents use immigration loopholes to take advantage of New Zealand taxpayers.

“They are often on full allowances and have no intention of staying in New Zealand once qualified.”

Mr Peters said it was past time for the Government to give priority to New Zealand youth who are “under-resourced, under-valued, and increasingly over there”.
