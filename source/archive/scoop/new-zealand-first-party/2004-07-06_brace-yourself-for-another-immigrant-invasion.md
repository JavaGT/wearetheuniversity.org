Brace Yourself For Another Immigrant Invasion

Brace Yourself For Another Immigrant Invasion

New Zealand First has accused Labour and National of softening up New Zealanders for another immigrant invasion under the guise of meeting a shortage of skilled workers.

This follows the Government raising the cap on the number of new migrants allowed into the country and National calling for more so-called skilled migrants.

Rt Hon Winston Peters said that under both Labour and National thousands of young people had left educational institutions without any qualifications and were now being left on the scrap heap while immigrants were sought for the best jobs.

“National now wants immigrant students to stay here to work while Labour wants another immigrant boom to prop up the economy until the next election.

“Neither party has the real interests of New Zealand at heart. It is the role of government to ensure that young people are trained and educated because they represent the future of this country.

“We are being dragged into the status of Asian colony and it is time that New Zealanders were placed first in their own country,” said Mr Peters.
