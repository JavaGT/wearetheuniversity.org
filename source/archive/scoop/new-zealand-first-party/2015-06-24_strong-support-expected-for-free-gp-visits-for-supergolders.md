Strong Support Expected for Free GP Visits for Supergolders

Strong Support Expected for Free GP Visits for Supergold Card Holders

New Zealand First expects strong support from all parties for its common sense SuperGold Card Health Check Bill due for its first reading in Parliament today.

“The three free GP health checks in the bill will keep thousands of people out of hospital by catching problems early,” says Member of Parliament for Northland and New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters. “It makes economic sense.”

“With the government unable to make a surplus and cutting dollars and cents everywhere National can be expected to seriously support this into legislation. If only one per cent to two per cent of SuperGold Cardholders getting free health checks are kept out of hospital the programme will not add any cost to the health system.

“United Future’s Peter Dunne is likely to see the economic and social advantages. This Bill fits with his wish in 2008 for a free annual ‘warrant of fitness’ health check for Seniors.

“We also expect the Maori Party’s support as it is dedicated to improving the lives of kaumatua and kuia. These checks will improve the lives of all, relieving pressure on families and friends who would otherwise have to care for an older friend or relative.

“By keeping SuperGold Cardholders out of hospital we can contain our health spending. The average cost to the taxpayer for a stay in hospital is $10,000.

“There is the added cost after a hospital stay. The patient may lose confidence, and require more assistance from their family, and there is follow up care and treatment required.

“All political parties will see the sense of voting for this legislation as free visits will benefit individuals, their families and the economy.”
