Thousands of Children to Receive Clothing Allowance

Thousands of Children to Receive Clothing Allowance After New Zealand First Bill Passes

Thousands of children will receive a clothing allowance after a New Zealand First Bill passed in Parliament last night.

“We expect about 12,000 orphaned or unsupported children who are being looked after by family will be eligible,” says Deputy Leader Tracey Martin.

Mrs Martin’s member’s bill, the Social Security (Clothing Allowances for Orphans and Unsupported Children) Amendment Bill, grew from concern that many children were missing out, yet foster children received the allowance.

The Bill means the children will receive a clothing allowance of between $1000 and $1685, depending on their age.

“It will make a huge difference to those looking after them, who are often grandparents, and on low incomes.

“About 40 per cent of the carers are on incomes of less than $33,000 a year. Many are women.”

The Bill passed with unanimous support, but there will be a three-year wait till July 2018 when the allowance is available.
