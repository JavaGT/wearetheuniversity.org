Stop Phantom Party Funding
==========================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader

12 June 2013

**Stop Phantom Party Funding**

New Zealand First has called on the Speaker to stop recognising United Future as a political party in Parliament as the Electoral Commission has ruled that it must go through the process of registering a new party.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says taxpayers should not be paying more than a hundred thousand dollars a year to a Member of Parliament’s party that is no longer recognised under the Electoral Act.

“The situation is becoming farcical and is more suited to a banana republic than a democracy.

“The ghost of United Future should be exorcised by the immediate withdrawal of political funding and this should take effect from the day party officials failed to file a membership return to the Electoral Commission.

“National must stop using public funds to prop up United Future. It is acting outside the law and the Speaker must take account of the Electoral Commission’s requirement,” says Mr Peters.
