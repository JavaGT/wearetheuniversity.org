New Zealand First Delivers On Carbon Tax Promise

The Rt Hon Winston Peters welcomed the announcement today that the government will be scrapping its proposed carbon tax as a consequence of a review which was established as part of New Zealand First's supply and confidence agreement.

"We were always confident that if a thorough review was done of the carbon tax proposal, that it would be exposed as the folly that most of us knew it to be," said Mr Peters.

"This is not to minimise the need to be vigilant in addressing environmental issues, but rather to recognise that more appropriate mechanisms exist to better achieve the same end.

"The government's decision is a victory for the thousands of New Zealanders who were not well placed to carry the burden of another tax, particularly those on low and fixed incomes.

"It also highlights just how decrepit the National party's ideas bank is and how meaningless their so-called petition has proven to be. The solution was always going to be based on a substantive review (which was the New Zealand First approach) rather than petty grandstanding."

Mr Peters said this decision is a further step in what is proving to be a truly constructive arrangement between the government and New Zealand First on many fronts and to the benefit of all New Zealanders.

"New Zealand First looks forward to the development of a comprehensive programme that provides for reforestation, improved energy efficiency and greater investment in renewable energy," concluded Mr Peters.
