Victoria Cross A Symbol Of NZSAS' Valuable Work

New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters has offered his congratulations to a member of the New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS) for being awarded the Victoria Cross, saying that the outstanding service of the individual is testament to the valuable contribution of the NZSAS as a whole during its time in Afghanistan.

"This is an incredible achievement for Corporal Bill Apiata, and the award not only recognises his bravery, but also reflects well on the dedication of all NZSAS members who served in Afghanistan in 2004.

"I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Apiata and to the NZSAS as a whole. I am pleased that the valuable work of this service has been acknowledged in such a remarkable way," concluded Mr Peters.
