**Catastrophe in Making with Record Levels of Debt-Ridden Foreign Students**

New Zealand is facing a catastrophe from highly indebted students entering the country on student visas, warns New Zealand First.

“The absolute rush to get to New Zealand is evidenced in the massive 8300 applications made to the Immigration NZ India office in Mumbai in just two months prior to a new English language requirement,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“New Zealand First warned the National Government of the stupidity of extending work rights to foreign students.

“It opened up a pathway to residence and a flood of immigrants, one of the main drivers in immigration reaching a new record for the 15th consecutive month – 120,100 immigrants in the year to October and a record net gain of 62,500.

“Low-skilled jobs are being taken over by foreign students desperate to earn to pay off debt, and open to being exploited by employers. Their goal is not study.

“Immigration NZ is well aware that when Australia realised the so-called Export Education sector was an avenue for many to residency, they clamped down on student visas overnight.

“This trapped 35,000 international students as illegal overstayers. They were unable to go home because of the money owed.

“It’s time for swift action to stop the student-visa-for-residency scam, and protect migrants from saddling themselves and their families with debt.”
