Government’s Pregnant Pause on Neonatal Units Unacceptable
==========================================================

**GOVERNMENT’S PREGNANT PAUSE ON NEONATAL UNITS UNACCEPTABLE**

New Zealand First is asking the Government whether it intends to issue pregnant mothers with frequent flier cards in case they need to be airlifted to specialised intensive care units.

Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says Government-issued frequent flier cards would at least acknowledge the fact that an alarming number of expectant mothers are being transferred to medial facilities hundreds of kilometres away.

“Last year 33 expectant mothers were transferred from Waikato to centres away from their families.

“Each instance cost taxpayers between $8000 and $11,000 on air transfers alone.

“How many more of these expensive examples are needed before the Government sees the light and increases the number of beds and staff in neonatal intensive care units throughout New Zealand?

“Anything less is placing the health and wellbeing of pregnant mums and new born babies at risk,” says Mrs Stewart.
