Taihape School Review Needs Rethinking

New Zealand First says that the Taihape parents who are unhappy about the Ministry of Education’s handling of their recent review will be buoyed by research undertaken by the Aegis Education Service.

“Aegis Director Dr Shirley Harris stated in the report that the review process must be one over which the community has control and power,” said associate education spokesperson and former secondary school principal Jim Peters.

“She also said that the diminishing number of school-age children in New Zealand over the coming years means that schools need to plan for change.

“The report stressed the importance of following an objective and independent process in regard to decisions about the continuing site.

“Many Taihape parents would agree that a new school must get off to a good start. They would also agree that any new school sites must only be chosen after comprehensive consultation.

“Sadly, this was not the case for the recent Taihape review, which left many parents feeling alienated and angry.

“I call upon the Minister of Education to rethink whether the merger, and particularly the site of the Taihape schools, is one that will work well for present and future students,” said Mr Peters.
