Record Migration Paints NZ as ‘Pacific Fool’

New Zealand is fast becoming the world’s ‘Pacific fool’ as immigration continues to soar to another record, says New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters and Member of Parliament for Northland.

“The government is condemning more Kiwis to the dole queue and to a life in rental houses,” says Mr Peters.

“Soon there will be anger as so many miss out on the Kiwi dream of home ownership especially in Auckland, where over half the record net 57,800 migrants are settling.

“It is totally unfair– the government is setting New Zealand up in competition with newcomers for houses and jobs, and is trying to paint a rosy picture of the economy by pouring in migrants to fuel consumption. It’s clear Mr Key and National have completely run out of ideas and think mass migration will disguise their economic failures.

“Young Kiwi workers are also missing out on low-skilled jobs as foreign students, most of whom want permanent residence, take over in supermarkets, service stations and hotels. With about 100,000 foreign students in the country it is a recipe for disaster.

“Why should foreign students be allowed to work at all? Our supposed Export Education industry is supposed to be bringing in foreign exchange.

“Indian student arrivals of 12,100 are double the previous year and Chinese student arrivals were up 22 per cent to over 7000 in the past year.

“The OECD warned last year that New Zealand’s unmanaged flow of temporary workers, the biggest among 34 OECD countries, would be very bad for New Zealander’s job chances.

“But the government carried on, extending migrant work visas from one-year to three years for the Christchurch Rebuild. So much for it saying the migrant visas were a temporary solution. There’s been plenty of time to get Kiwi workers into those low skilled jobs.

“New Zealand First wants immigration wound back, and a stop on non-residents buying property.”
