Warnings About Licence Cheats Ignored - Mark

New Zealand First MP Ron Mark says he is not surprised at reports of regular cheating in drivers licence tests or that Auckland, with its high immigrant population, has been described as ‘hotbed’ of licence cheats.

Mr Mark welcomed the fact that the Minister for Transport Safety is sufficiently concerned to review the situation, but pointed out that this is not the first time that claims of cheating and corruption had been brought to the attention of Land Transport.

“When I first raised this issue in 2003 with the then Minister of Transport, I pointed out that people using interpreters were being given the answers when taking the theory test, and instructions when taking the practical test.

“I raised the issue again 18 months ago, and again the Government took the line that my concerns were grounded less in safety than in racism.

”Despite an admission by LTNZ at that time that they knew it was happening, they said there was nothing they could do to prevent it.

“Now they admit that cheating and bribery are rife.

“It is a matter of great concern that there could be so many unqualified and dangerous drivers out there driving on fraudulently-obtained licences, especially younger people and overseas students.

“LTNZ are quick to tell New Zealanders that dishing out quota tickets to Nana for doing 111kmph on an open deserted road is all about safety and getting the road toll down. It is time for them to take this issue out of the too-hard basket and finally do something about it,” concluded Mr Mark.
