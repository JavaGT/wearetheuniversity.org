Dalziel Reveals Government's Policy On Foreign Students

  
New Zealand First has questioned the Government’s priorities over educating New Zealand students versus foreign students.

According to Minister of Immigration, Lianne Dalziel, foreign children whose parents pay the fees should have a right to attend any of our primary schools.

In response to a question from New Zealand First education spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly, asking why foreign-fee paying students should be allowed to attend our primary schools, the Minister replied, “Because they’ve paid their fees”.

“It would appear that no consideration is to be given to whether such students might detract from the attention New Zealand students receive, no consideration is to be given to the impact upon the supply of primary teachers to teach our own population, no consideration is to be given to school accommodation, “ said Mr Donnelly.

“The simple justification for allowing foreign children into our schools is that their fees have been paid. In other words, cough up the dough and to a New Zealand school you can go,” said Mr Donnelly.

“Taxpayers deserve better than such a limp policy.”
