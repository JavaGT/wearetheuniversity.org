She's Got To Be Kidding, And She Has To Go!

“Immigration Minister’s double-speak has landed her in hot water yet again,” Opposition Leader Winston Peters said.

Mr Peters was commenting on Lianne Dalziel’s incredible comments following the Court of Appeal’s appropriate decision to keep asylum seekers locked up.

“Remember this is the Government who opened the doors to asylum seekers and to a deluge of foreign students and a torrent of third world immigrants. Remember this is the Minister that who has consistently been unable to answer our reasonable questions about who is coming into our country, what is their status, and where they are now. Remember this is the regime that refuses to debate immigration or let New Zealanders have a say in a population policy.

“And then consider Ms Dalziel’s outlandish, outrageous, and gobsmacking pretence that she too is pleased with the Court’s decision and the flabbergasting “We have an absolute right to know who is in our country, where they are from, and why they are here.” Absolutely Minister, countless questions we have asked you in the House have demanded these answers! More to the point: shouldn’t we know who is coming, where they are from, and why they want to come here BEFORE we admit them? This Minister HAS TO GO!” said Mr Peters.
