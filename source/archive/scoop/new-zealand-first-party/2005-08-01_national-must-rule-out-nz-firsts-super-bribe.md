National must rule out NZ First's super bribe

Rodney Hide Monday, 1 August 2005 Press Releases - Taxation

Don Brash must rule out Winston Peters' unsustainable superannuation bribe because it will make National's tax cuts unaffordable, ACT Leader Rodney Hide said today.

"Winston Peters has announced big spending election bribes, including an unsustainable $650 million a year on superannuation to buy the elderly vote - bribes that would clearly hamper National's ability to deliver sizeable tax cuts.

"We have seen it all before in 1996, when National caved in to Winston's spending demands and deferred tax cuts which had already been legislated for.

"Every party must tell voters which of their policies are non- negotiable and which policies could be traded off for a place at the Cabinet table.

"Voters should have all the information they need to cast an informed vote. They need to be confident that there will be no unpleasant post-election surprises.

"NZ First's super policy is as much a vote bribe as Labour's $500 million a year student loan policy.

"Don Brash needs to tell voters whether or not he's prepared to trade off tax cuts and rule out agreeing to Winston's super bribe, " Mr Hide said.
