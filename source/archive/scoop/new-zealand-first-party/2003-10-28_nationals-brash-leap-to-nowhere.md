National’s Brash Leap To Nowhere

New Zealand First says the election of Don Brash represents another lurch towards oblivion for National.

Rt Hon Winston Peters said today that National had become increasingly irrelevant to the lives of most New Zealanders and that changing the leadership would only accelerate the demise of the party.

“Don Brash is a political novice who will be best remembered as a Reserve Bank governor who closed down the economy through ruthless interest rate hikes that closed hundreds of firms and cost the jobs of thousands of New Zealanders.

“National will become ACT in drag because Dr Brash is well known for his hard right policies like putting up the age of eligibility for pensions and forcing the unemployed to queue up outside post offices, which no longer exist!

“New Zealand First, like most First World governments, rejects these hard right policies and has nothing in common with the politicians who espouse them. We believe in an inclusive society in which everyone has a part to play.

”Here comes Jim McLay MK 3,” predicted Winston Peters.
