Project Energize Deserves DHB Funding

With one in nine New Zealand children suffering from obesity Hamilton’s Project Energize should be extended across New Zealand, says New Zealand First.

“Project Energize is a programme for Kiwi kids to improve their physical fitness and nutrition. About 44,000 primary and intermediate school children from 244 schools have now taken part in it in the Waikato area,” says Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“A 2011 survey found that Project Energize kids weighed less, ran faster, and had smaller waists than other children. The positive results speak for themselves – this is having a real impact on kids making nutritional choices.

“At only $45 per child per year, the funding of Project Energise is a drop in the bucket compared to the $686 million that obesity costs New Zealand’s healthcare system.

“This is a no-brainer. District Health Boards should be funding this proven programme across the whole of the country,” says Mrs Stewart.
