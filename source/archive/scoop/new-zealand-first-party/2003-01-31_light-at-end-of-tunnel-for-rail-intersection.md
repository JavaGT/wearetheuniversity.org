Light At End Of Tunnel For Rail Intersection Improvements

New Zealand First MP Ron is on track to improve safety at a North Canterbury level crossing after a truck driver collided with a freight train in November.

Mr Mark met with Transit NZ officials in Christchurch this week in a bid to resolve a disagreement between authorities over who is responsible for improvements to the Fernside Rd level crossing.

A lack of safety barrier and lights at the intersection has been blamed for several accidents in recent years – the latest of which resulted in a truck driver being hospitalised for over four weeks and left him with permanent head injuries.

“It is obvious that an upgrade to this crossing is urgently needed before another devastating accident. I have been approached by the family of the family of the truck driver and a number of residents worried that the next collision at Fernside Rd will involve deaths which could have been prevented,” said Mr Mark.

“Transit NZ were positive about fast-tracking improvements to the level crossing and agreed to be involved in a round table discussion with the two other invoved parties – Waimakariri District Countil and Tranzrail,” he said.

Mr Mark is expected to meet with representatives of Tranzrail, the Mayor of Rangiora and the Land Transport Safety Authority shortly.
