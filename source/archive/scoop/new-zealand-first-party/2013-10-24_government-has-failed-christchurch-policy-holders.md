Spokesperson for Christchurch Earthquake Issues

**Government Has Failed Christchurch Policy Holders**

The situation faced by many insurance policy holders in Christchurch is a national disgrace because of the long delays in settling claims and rebuilding houses, says Earthquake Issues spokesperson Denis O’Rourke.

Mr O’Rourke has told Parliament that the first of the Canterbury earthquakes happened three years ago so there is no excuse for the lengthy delays.

“The constant delays by insurers over earthquake claims, the failures by insurers to honour their policies and the treatment of people who placed their trust in those policies and insurers for full replacement insurance, define one of the most disgraceful episodes in New Zealand’s commercial history.”

“Never has such utterly despicable behaviour been seen by commercial insurers on such a scale.”

Mr O’Rourke says that there are literally hundreds of heart-wrenching cases, one of which in an email to him today says:

_“I am writing this with a hope that I get help from your side to get our insurance to rebuild our home. IAG is just telling lies and bullying me all the time by simply giving me excuses that it is very complex, time consuming. I am sick of hearing this time and again. It has been a major battle that is happening since more than a year. Please help me.”_

Mr O’Rourke also criticised Southern Response which he described as “one of the worst”.

“That would a great name if it was true, but ‘response’ is exactly what it is not.

“Anyone who saw the Campbell Live show recently would know that Southern Response is just another of the insurers that we are all so disgusted with in Christchurch.

“It’s just another failure, just another incompetent performer, just another delayer, and just another arrogant and unhelpful obstacle for policy holders. In the meantime people suffer, health suffers, families suffer, and communities suffer.”

Mr O’Rourke says Christchurch people have had enough and the Government was told years ago that it needed to intervene.

“The response from the Government has been a long deafening silence.

“New Zealand First has pledged to establish a new state insurance company, Kiwisure, to ensure that there is a reliable insurer which will offer genuine replacement insurance. It will be government controlled and guaranteed, and will deal with disaster claims promptly and fairly.”
