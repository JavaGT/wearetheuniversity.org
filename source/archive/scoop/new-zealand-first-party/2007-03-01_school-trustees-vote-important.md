School Trustees Vote Important

New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters is urging parents throughout New Zealand to exercise their vote at the forthcoming School Trustee Elections this month.

Schools around the country are holding campaigns for school trustee elections and nominations for school trustees are being called for today with voting closing on 29 March.

"School trustees play a critically important role in the provision of education services and standards to children. In addition, schools play a significant role in the wider community through such initiatives as adult education and the provision of community facilities.

"Our schools need people on their board who can be active decision-makers in the interests of student achievement and in ensuring that students reach their potential. The decisions they make also need to be reflective of communities' wants, needs and aspirations.

"I encourage parents to vote to ensure that they get the best board for their school," said Mr Peters.
