Government Neglects Acc Victims

Government Neglects Acc Victims

New Zealand First MP and ACC spokesperson Peter Brown has accused the Government of closing down debate on the ACC debacle when there is obviously a serious problem with the system.

“I have asked for an inquiry into ACC procedure and have requested a debate in the House, both of which have been turned down,” said Mr Brown.

“The precedent-setting court case last week could see hundreds of cases reviewed and possibly millions of dollars paid out in back interest to claimants wrongfully treated by ACC.

“This is an issue that affects thousands of people and they have the right to be heard on this issue. On their behalf I have written to the chairperson of the Transport and Industrial Relation Select Committee repeating my request for an inquiry into the:

Interface between ACC and Social Services organization (WINZ) Modus operandi of ACC Disputes Resolution Services Ltd. Accident Claimants Advocacy Service  
”ACC was implemented so New Zealanders would be compensated for injuries caused through accidents instead of suing the party who caused the accident.

“This organisation is now being sued, and successfully, by the very people it was set-up to help because their cases have been so poorly dealt with. What kind of Mickey Mouse outfit has ACC become?

“The Government has a responsibility to listen and act on what is clearly a major problem,” said Mr Brown.
