Target School Funding to Student Needs

Target School Funding to Student Needs

  
Education funding must support students in need no matter what school they attend, says New Zealand First.

“It’s heartening that Minister of Education Hekia Parata is considering a review of the decile rating funding component for public schools,” says Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“This is a turnaround given the Minister was somewhat dismissive of the New Zealand First suggestion three years ago to create a funding method based on the direct needs of students.

“New Zealand First is still concerned the Minister may not be able to resist the opportunity to move forward with a bonus pay or outcomes-based funding model aligned to other government public service targets.

“To get the best outcome for our students we would recommend that Parliament’s Education and Science Select Committee considers funding options in an open and collaborative manner.

“New Zealand First campaigned in the General Election for more sharing of ideas across political parties, the government and the education sector. We challenge the Minister to join with us in this approach for the betterment of our children.”
