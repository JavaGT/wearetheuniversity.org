Immigrants Likely for Bus Jobs in Auckland

Minister of Immigration Michael Woodhouse needs to reassure the 220,000 Kiwis (Woodhouse, Morning Report, Radio NZ, 16th August) wanting a job that visas will not be issued for bus drivers to work in Auckland, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“New Zealand First understands that an Auckland bus company is considering employing 200 drivers from the Pacific.

“Their job vacancy states holding Class 2 and Class 4 licences would be preferable but training to obtain them can be given.

“New Zealand is already taking tens of thousands of low-skilled workers, when immigration settings should only be for skilled workers in areas of shortages and workers who benefit this country.

“The government has a responsibility to ensure Kiwis are looked after but Immigration NZ offers migrants ‘a one-to-one mentoring service’ for migrants to ‘gain and retain’ jobs. Where is the one-to-one service for jobless Kiwis?

“It seems New Zealand has become too politically correct and is catering for the needs of people from other countries at the expense of our own people,” Mr Peters says.
