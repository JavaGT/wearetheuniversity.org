Kiwi Call Centre In Bombay? Asks Peters

Rt. Hon Winston Peters says a planned "one-stop shop" to handle all public dealings with government departments could end up “outsourced” in the Philippines or India.

The new ServiceLink organisation – a mega call-centre – is reportedly being set up in a plan for the one agency to handle everything from phone and internet inquiries to applications for benefits, tax returns, fines and other payments for state services.

Mr Peters says there is an ulterior motive lurking behind everything this government does and outsourcing the call centre overseas would follow the pattern set by big companies such as Telecom.

“It is only a matter of time before the call centre starts being staffed by people overseas who are prepared to accept even lower wages than the pittance now being paid to the vast majority of New Zealanders.

“This government is taking away thousands of New Zealanders' jobs and doing virtually nothing to replace them except support the disgraceful gambling project in central Auckland where it has again shown it is prepared to sell law changes to its mates.

“We are going to the wall and the government is making matters worse,” said Mr Peters.
