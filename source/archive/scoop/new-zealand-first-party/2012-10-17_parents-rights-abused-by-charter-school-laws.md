Parents Rights Abused by Charter School Laws

Parents Rights Abused by Charter School Laws

The Government is eliminating parents’ right to information about their child’s education through the seriously flawed Education Amendment Bill, says New Zealand First.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Bill makes a double-pronged attack by removing Charter Schools – now disingenuously renamed Partnerships Schools – from having to release information under the Official Information and Ombudsman acts.

“If a student is expelled from a state school the parent or caregiver can seek a review of the Board of Trustee’s decision through the Ombudsman’s Office. That right will be removed at Charter Schools.

“The double whammy comes with these schools also not being covered by the Official Information Act.

“These underhand tactics will allow these schools to get rid of students for any reason without recourse for affected families.”

Ms Martin says the Bill will also see the Government abdicate its responsibility to build new Early Childhood Education Centres.

“Instead it will allow private developers to lease Crown land to build centres which will in turn be leased to private service providers.

“These private companies will essentially be lining their own pockets with taxpayer’s childcare subsidy money,” says Ms Martin.
