Peters Makes Statement To House
===============================

Media Release  
29 June 2004

Peters Makes Statement To House

Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal statement to the House.

Allegations were made against me during my absence from New Zealand last week.

Those allegations are baseless and ridiculous and I immediately instructed my legal counsel to take action, seeking damages and costs from those organisations and individuals who promulgated those allegations.

Accordingly, papers were lodged in the High Court in Auckland today seeking damages and costs from Television New Zealand, Radio New Zealand, Yvonne Dossetter, Ken Shirley MP and David Carter MP.

Those who would publish or repeat such allegations either do not know me or know nothing of what I have achieved in my political career.

My only other comment is to say:

"Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;  
’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands;  
But he that filches from me my good name  
Robs me of that which not enriches him,  
And makes me poor indeed. “

ENDS
