Peters Pays Tribute To Michael King

New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters today paid tribute to Dr Michael King who was killed yesterday with his wife Maria Jungowska in a tragic car accident.

“Dr King made an immeasurable contribution to New Zealand through his writings about New Zealand history and his biographies of great New Zealanders. It is important to recall his great empathy with Maori and his ability to communicate with them,” said Mr Peters.

“We extend our sympathies to the family.

“It is a great loss to the New Zealand literary and academic society. Dr King leaves behind a legacy of great work and will not be forgotten,” said Mr Peters.
