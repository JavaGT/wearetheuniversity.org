Refusal to Release Report in ‘Drunk Schoolgirls’ Case
=====================================================

Authority Refuses to Release Report in ‘Drunk Schoolgirls’ Case

Secrecy still surrounds a case involving degrading acts on young women despite an investigation into police conduct, says New Zealand First.

“It’s appalling that the Independent Police Conduct Authority has refused to produce a public report on police actions in a case in which girls were apparently deliberately intoxicated by young males and lewd photographs posted online,” says Spokesperson for Women Tracey Martin.

“The authority is hiding the investigation behind a ‘secrecy provision’ in the legislation it works under.

“It says the investigation by police was robust and thorough – if so, then the authority should reveal just how it was done. They could do this and protect the identity of those involved.

“The authority should inform the public and explain why no charges were laid and why the male students were only given a warning.

“We are led to suspect that this could have been a case of unconscious bias in which the police put blame on the young women,” says Mrs Martin.

New Zealand First has a member’s bill, the Crimes (Covert Intimate Filming of Incapacitated Persons) Amendment Bill, that will close a loophole in legislation around such cases.
