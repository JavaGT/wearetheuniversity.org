Send Problem Japanese Students Home Says Peters

Send Problem Japanese Students Home Says Peters

New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters wants the Government to close a school for problem Japanese youths in West Auckland and to deport those connected with it.

This follows the appearance in court of the director of the school for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice following the death of a Japanese student.

Nine students from the academy have been charged with the assault and kidnapping of the dead student.

Mr Peters said it was astonishing that such a school would be allowed in New Zealand when this country already had a “superabundance” of home grown problem teenagers.

“The Japanese government would certainly not welcome a plane load of Mongrel mob prospects from New Zealand so why should we import their social problems?

“The authorities should take a long hard look at this school and any others like it with a view to closing them down and sending those involved with them back to where they came from.”

Mr Peters said it was a sorry state of affairs when some individuals seemed to think that importing social problems from Asia was a good way to grow the New Zealand economy.
