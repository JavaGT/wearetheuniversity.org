Quality education has been further compromised by National’s decision to close down half of the country’s Residential Special Schools, says New Zealand First disability issues spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“Children who attend Residential Special Schools have complex mental health needs which demand intensive attention from teachers.

“The Government’s decision to place these children in mainstream schools creates a losing situation for both special needs students and their classmates who will compete for valuable teacher time.”

Mrs Stewart says statistics reveal that 20 per cent of students are already failing in our education system.

“This latest misguided move by National will only worsen the situation by placing unnecessary demands on already overburdened teachers.

“It shows the Government is more interested in saving money than in providing quality education for all irrespective of any disabilities,” says Mrs Stewart.
