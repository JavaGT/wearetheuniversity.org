Pasifika Unemployment at Unacceptable Levels

**Pasifika Unemployment at Unacceptable Levels**

New Zealand First says unemployment among Pacific Island people has more than doubled under National to a shocking 15.6 per cent – the highest for any single ethnic group.

Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson Asenati Lole-Taylor says the latest Household Labour Force Survey makes grim reading for Pacific Island people.

“When National took office in 2008 the unemployment rate of Pacific Island people was 7.3 per cent.

“Today it is sitting at 15.6 per cent despite National’s promise of a brighter future for all New Zealanders.”

Mrs Lole-Taylor says Finance Minister Bill English’s acknowledgement in Parliament today that the unemployment figure is “appalling’’ provides little comfort for the thousands of Pasifika people looking for work.

“This Government is failing the Pasifika population by inflicting significant financial misery on individuals and families through a failure to create anywhere near enough jobs.

“Mr English and the National-led Government would rather give empty condolences to those without jobs instead of taking action to rectify the problem,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
