Education For New Zealanders – First!

Education For New Zealanders – First!

“The education package announced by the Prime Minister yesterday enabling Chinese citizens to engage in tax-funded tertiary programmes is an outrage,” says New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“The programme not only includes subsidisation of studies but also payment of preschool and schooling costs of any of the children of the recipients of this generous scheme.”

“Moreover, partners will be able to come and work in New Zealand.

“The scheme is being offered to foreigners in countries around the world including oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia.

“Our own New Zealand citizens are being turned away from higher studies because of student loans and the 200-week rule and at the same time we are paying for foreigners to study here.”

“Foreigners who wish to benefit should be expected to pay full costs and the idea of aid being offered to countries like Saudi Arabia is a nonsense.”

“The New Zealand education system should be for New Zealanders FIRST,” said Brian Donnelly.
