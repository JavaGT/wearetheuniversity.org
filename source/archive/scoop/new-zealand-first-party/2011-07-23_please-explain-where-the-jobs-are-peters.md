Please Explain Where The Jobs Are - Peters
==========================================

**PRESS RELEASE**  
  
  
**Please Explain Where The Jobs Are - Peters**

New Zealand First has called on the government to explain exactly how it is going to create 170,000 new jobs over the next four years.

This follows reported comments by the Nelson MP and cabinet minister Nick Smith that there was no "quick fix" to the unemployment situation.

Rt. Hon Winston Peters says the Budget in May clearly stated that 170,000 new jobs would be created but since then well over three thousand people have lost their jobs.

“There are a lot of people looking for work, waiting for the government’s confident prediction to start showing some sign of reality.

“It appears that they will be waiting a long time before anything to happen and it is interesting that the comments of Nick Smith bear no resemblance to the optimistic Budget forecast.”

Mr Peters says the economy is wallowing in a trough while international foreign exchange speculators have a field day throwing the New Zealand dollar into orbit.

“The exporters we need to help create jobs are hurting because of the artificially inflated Kiwi dollar and there appears to be no relief in sight.

“We cannot afford to sit and wait for some economic miracle to appear. The people need jobs now and a sensible plan to get the economy moving again is long overdue,” says Mr. Peters.
