PM Stoops To ‘Bilge Rat’ Politics On Auckland Housing

**PM Stoops To ‘Bilge Rat’ Politics On Auckland Housing**

Auckland Council is a victim of the ‘bilge rat’ politics of Prime Minister John Key, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Mr Key is bullying the council. Fix housing or we put in commissioners. That’s dictatorial. It’s arrogant.

“National has had eight years to address the shortage of housing in Auckland.

“In 2007 John Key was outspoken in condemning the Labour government for its lack of action.

“He has done nothing, and worse has stoked the fire. He never warned the council the government would ramp up immigration to record levels,” says Mr Peters.

“Now in desperation, as garages and cars become Auckland’s new lifestyle, teachers escape the city, and students are forced to couch surf for a bed each night, he blames the Auckland council.

“The very council imposed on the people by the National Party and specifically by ACT Party leader Rodney Hide.

“Solutions to the housing crisis were swirling around, but everyone ignored the elephant in the room – artificial demand from immigration.

“It is an untouchable issue.

“Around 35,000, or nearly 700 people a week, are looking for a home in Auckland. But we must not talk about it, heaven forbid.

“National doesn’t have the guts, nor do others, to address the core issue – immigration. Yet tomorrow, the tap could be turned down. It is controllable.”
