**NZ First Marks World Teachers Day With Visit To Christchurch**

New Zealand First education spokesperson Tracey Martin will be spending World Teachers Day – Friday, October 26 – visiting a number of Christchurch schools and early childhood education centres.

"These learning institutions have been critical to supporting Christchurch communities during the most difficult of times.

“Despite the challenges faced in Christchurch, teachers continued to deliver high quality teaching for students who consider them to be role models.”

Ms Martin says her visit on World Teachers Day will provide an opportunity to hear teachers’ concerns about the Government’s proposal to close or merge scores of Christchurch schools.

“National has embarked on a four year - attack on teachers and the teaching profession, with mass school closures being the latest outrageous suggestion.

“But putting that aside, we encourage every student to tomorrow acknowledge their teacher.

“I will be doing my bit by surprising teachers at both schools in my home town of Warkworth with chocolate cakes iced with the message ‘Teachers are our greatest resource’."
