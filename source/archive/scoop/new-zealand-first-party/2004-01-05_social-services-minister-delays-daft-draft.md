Social Services Minister Delays Daft Draft

New Zealand First has warned the Social Services Minister that he faces a tough time if he continues to treat people like drafted sheep and make them live like animals in a predetermined area.

“Maharey’s much vaunted job jolt scheme is doomed because it is a dog,” said New Zealand First Social Services Spokesman, Bill Gudgeon.

“The Minister needs to come out of his ivory tower and recognise that he is dealing with people who have untapped potential and need opportunities not coercion. These are people Mr. Maharey, not sheep!

“The prospect of some districts being declared ‘dead’ economic zones is a further indictment of a government with no vision and would consign tens of thousands of New Zealanders in the regions to second class citizenship,” Mr. Gudgeon said.

“The infrastructural pressures on cities like Auckland have been caused by Labour’s misguided policies and shifting the unemployed to specific economic zones is likely to be just as harmful. The certain result is that there will be greater social dislocation and increasing dependency on the state.

“The creation of real employment opportunities, a programme of incentives for innovative and exporting businesses, and the provision of appropriate skills for our work force are much more likely to deal with the unacceptably high incidence of unemployment.

“Instead of dictating where and how we live the Government ought to be providing n economic plan. Maharey’s draft is daft,” said Mr. Gudgeon.
