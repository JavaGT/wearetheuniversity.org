All New Zealanders Should Be Able to See All Blacks Free

All New Zealanders Should Be Able to See All Blacks Free on TV

The government needs to step in and ensure all Kiwis can view the All Blacks on free-to-view television, especially when they are playing in New Zealand, says New Zealand First.

“Rugby remains New Zealand’s national game but it has become increasingly a game in which major matches can only be watched live by the better-off members of our society,” says New Zealand First’s Spokesperson for Sport and Recreation Clayton Mitchell.

“There will be many people who cannot to afford to buy tickets to attend Saturday night’s test at Eden Park between the All Blacks and Wales.

“Hundreds of thousands of others will miss out on watching the game live on television because they can’t afford to pay a monthly fee to Sky.

“The All Blacks are our showpiece team and the public should be able to view them for free on television, as they once could.

“Critics say if free-to-view is introduced the All Blacks themselves will suffer because they will miss out on money coming to them via broadcasting rights.

“This is where the government must step in and do as governments in Britain and Australia have done and ensure certain sports have free, live broadcasts.

“After all, it is taxpayers’ money that is propping up TVNZ and Māori TV,” Mr Mitchell says.
