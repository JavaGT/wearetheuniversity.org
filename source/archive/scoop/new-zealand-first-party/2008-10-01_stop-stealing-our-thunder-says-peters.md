Stop Stealing Our Thunder Says Peters

Rt Hon Winston Peters has asked the Labour Party to stop stealing all New Zealand First’s thunder over benefits for senior citizens that take effect today.

Mr Peters says the Prime Minister and her colleagues are riding around in trains and buses claiming credit for free off-peak travel which New Zealand First insisted on as part of its SuperGold Card deal.

“While we are delighted to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of senior citizens, we are not so pleased to have the Labour Party trying to grab the glory.

“We negotiated those concessions and we did the work.

“The SuperGold Card was our policy and we intend to go further with the benefits after the next election, including power, petrol and other concessions,” said Mr Peters.
