Government Continues Its Education Privatisation Agenda

**Government Continues Its Education Privatisation Agenda**

New Zealand First has accused the Government of continually stripping funding from public educational institutes as part of its privatisation agenda.

This follows the announcement that millions of dollars are being robbed from publicly-funded polytechs which will be pumped into private organisations.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government is abandoning its responsibility to education.

“A polytechnic with a track record of improving and providing safe and innovative environments for Pacifika students is one of the organisations facing funding cuts.

“This just goes to show that once again the Government says it cares about lifting student achievement and educational outcomes but in reality it is all about cost cutting and passing the buck,” says Ms Martin.
