Paintergate's A Diversion
=========================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

9 July 2002

“Richard Prebble’s accusation that Helen Clark had a ‘memory lapse of Wine Box proportions’ over “Paintergate” is the last writhe of a desperate ACT,” the New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said.

“Here is Prebble, the ultimate defender of the amnesiacs of the Wine Box, displaying double standards and hypocrisy in trying to beat up “Paintergate‘’ in a forlorn attempt to win some votes.

“His colleague Bill English is just as bad. In describing the Hospital Boards’ deficits as a ‘scandal of BNZ proportions’ Mr. English has conveniently forgotten that he voted against me when I sought to have the BNZ investigated, and he has conveniently forgotten his part in health restructuring,” Mr. Peters said.

“Let us put these things into perspective. Plagiarism is of concern to an academic, and Helen Clark should have known better, but rather than focus on the trivial why don’t these so-called leaders engage in a debate on the real issues?

“At all of our meetings around the country people want to talk about law and order, about the Treaty, and about immigration. They are not interested in any beat up of the Prime Minister’s lack of judgement over a painting,” Mr. Peter said.
