New Zealand First Supports More Women in the Police

New Zealand First Supports More Women in the Police

New Zealand First supports all police recruitment drives, including adding more women to the frontline to strengthen police work overall and better represent the community.

“New Zealand First’s record on police recruitment is strong – we succeeded in getting a thousand extra sworn police recruited as part of a confidence and supply agreement with the Labour government,” says Police Spokesperson Richard Prosser.

“We understand the benefits for everyone in keeping a strong police presence on the ground.”

Police Commissioner Mike Bush has launched a women's advisory board, a recruitment drive, and a television show about women in the police. Mr Bush says women make up about 20 per cent of the police.

“Having more women will not only make police more representative of the population, but it will also strengthen police work, especially with regards to issues affecting women.

“The only solution to strengthening our frontline effort and quick reaction times is to steadily increase numbers.

“Unfortunately, under the National Government police have been under resourced. Cuts in 2012 pushed sworn police into spending more time on paperwork when they should have stayed on the frontline, and local police stations have been closed,” says Mr Prosser.
