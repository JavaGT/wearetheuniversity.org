Overpaid Principals Acting Unprofessionally Says New Zealand First

“Principals who have been receiving supplements to their salary packages have been acting unprofessionally,” states New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

Mr Donnelly was a principal for 13 years before entering Parliament.

“Principals are the prime source of advice to their Boards on a day-to-day basis. It is they who should have advised their Boards on what was allowable and what was not under negotiated collective contracts. They can’t have it both ways.

“Professional bodies representing principals, such as the PPTA, should be censuring its members for these behaviors which could be viewed as stealing from the purse of money provided for students’ learning.

“As for the Ministry of Education, it has been nothing short of negligent in not doing anything about this issue for so long when it knew of the situation last July.

“The Minister of Education is going to have to step up to the base on this one,” said Mr. Donnelly.
