National Government Takes A Deep Swipe At Southerners

**National Government Takes A Deep Swipe At Southerners**

The passing of The New Zealand Public Health and Disability (Southern DHB) Elections Act in Parliament this week shows an utter disregard toward southerners’ democratic rights, says New Zealand First.

“The fact is a transitional board comprising locally elected members and the commissioner would have been just as likely to reduce the deficit facing the Southern DHB, as the commissioner alone would have”, says Ria Bond, New Zealand First List MP.

“According to Minister Coleman the commissioner and her team require more time to act.

“However, New Zealand First maintains this bill is a deep swipe at southerners and an insult to their ability to make their own decisions, for their own region.

“How can residents of Southland and Otago take the minister seriously, and trust their elected boards will be returned in 2019, when it has taken nine years for Environment Canterbury to reinstate democratic process?”

“New Zealand First offered common sense solutions to this government, and yet again, these are disregarded by an arrogant National-led Government, who are again showing signs of a disconnect with middle New Zealand,” Ria Bond says.
