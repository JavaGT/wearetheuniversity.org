New Zealand First Removes Tax On Tauranga Motorists

  
New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters is delighted that the the Land Transport Management (Road Tolling Scheme for Tauranga - Mt Maunganui Harbour Link) Order in Council has been revoked.

The $255 million project was initially to be half funded by tolling motorists until New Zealand First secured the designation of the project as a fully funded state highway as part of their post election confidence and supply agreement with Labour.

“This project is very close to my heart and I am delighted to see it now officially designated as toll-free,” said Mr Peters.

“Over the course of a year it will save the public who use the bridge - particularly Tauranga and Mt Maunganui people but also others who use it regularly - several thousand dollars, and over a lifetime, a huge amount of money.

“They have already paid for one bridge in Tauranga and New Zealand First were determined that the second bridge would be toll-free. We are pleased to have once again delivered on our promises in Tauranga.” concluded Mr Peters.
