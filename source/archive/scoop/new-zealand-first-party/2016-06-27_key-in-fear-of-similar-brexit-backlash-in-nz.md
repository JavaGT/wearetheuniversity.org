**Key in Fear of Similar Brexit Backlash in NZ**

The Prime Minister John Key is scrambling to reclaim ground after favouring Britain to stay in Europe and now he’s in fairy land over New Zealand’s immigration, says New Zealand First leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Open immigration into Britain was a major factor in the Brexit vote outcome which Mr Key knows, and now he’s propagating the myth his government has controlled immigration.

“New Zealand’s immigration is four times greater than Britain’s immigration intake per head of population – we have over 125,000 arriving annually and 69,000 net staying.

“Mr Key is very worried; he’s just seen the backlash the UK establishment received from a serious majority in Britain.

“The result left him like a stunned mullet because he has no plan B.

“Like the UK, hundreds of thousands of ordinary New Zealanders have been treated by the Key government as though they do not count and do not exist. It is these people who have put up with the huge stress of housing, health, education and infrastructural costs and they are sick of being preached at by a the power elite trying to tell them that all is well.”
