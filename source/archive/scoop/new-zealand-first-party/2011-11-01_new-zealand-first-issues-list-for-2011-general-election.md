Rt. Hon Winston Peters will not be standing for an electorate seat. The New Zealand First Board has decided he should concentrate his efforts on the party vote throughout the country.

It is not possible for Mr. Peters to concentrate on an electorate while campaigning the length and breadth of New Zealand, nor is it fair for an electorate to have an absentee candidate.

However New Zealand First has excellent candidates in many electorates and the Board has every confidence in them.

ENDS
