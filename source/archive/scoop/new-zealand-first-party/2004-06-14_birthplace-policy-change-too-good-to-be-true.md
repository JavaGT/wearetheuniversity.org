Government Birthplace Policy Change Too Good To Be True

Just when you thought this Government was about to act to close an immigration loophole exploited by thousands of people each year they have sold out to PC evangelists, says New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters.

Mr Peters’ comments come as the Internal Affairs Minister today assured the public that any change to the law which allows any person born in New Zealand to automatically be granted citizenship would not come as a result of the Identity (Citizenship and Travel Documents) Bill which is to be introduced to the House this month.

“Labour is well aware of the Members Bill currently in the ballot in the name of my New Zealand First colleague Edwin Perry, which seeks to ensure that any child born in New Zealand must be the child of a New Zealand citizen, in order for the child to acquire citizenship by virtue of being born in New Zealand”, said Mr Peters.

“The problem is they would rather pander to the bleeding heart soft touch policy proponents than adopt sensible New Zealand First policy which would stop these citizenship opportunists in their tracks.

“Unfortunately, it seems the only thing New Zealanders can do to stop this problem is to hope that Mr Perry’s Citizenship (New Zealand Citizens’ Birthright) Amendment Bill emerges from the ballot as Labour clearly has no interest in protecting the integrity of New Zealand citizenship and stopping this flagrant abuse of our system”, said Mr Peters
