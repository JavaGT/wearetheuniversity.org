Salisbury School’s Future Must Be Secured

Salisbury School’s Future Must Be Secured

  
The future of the only single sex residential school for girls and young women with learning disabilities and social, emotional or behavioural problems is still at risk, says New Zealand First.

“New Zealand First believes that the National Government is consciously starving Salisbury School, in Richmond, of students by encouraging the Ministry of Education Intensive Wraparound Service to decline referrals from mainstream schools, psychologists and other experts,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Tracey Martin.

“As the Ministry has complete control over accepting or declining applications there is no argument that the schools future squarely rests in their hands.

“When Katrina Casey, the Ministry of Education’s Head of Sector Enablement and Support, is quoted as saying that ‘while the Intensive Wraparound Service (IWS) becomes fully established we have been mindful of not quicklyreducing residential school capacity’ this gives us no confidence that they are not slowly reducing the residential school capacity.

“The staff at Salisbury have high academic aspirations for their students. When visiting the school it is obvious that without the quiet, therapeutic, flexible learning environment provided by these specialist teachers with a high staff to student ratio these young women would never achieve their best.

“Five years ago Salisbury had a roll of about 80 students but today there are only nine. Has the need lessened? No. This is an ideological stance by the National Government. Mainstreaming at all costs.

“For a government that provided millions to establish Charter Schools in the name of parent choice, it is ironic that too many parents of high needs learners are denied this choice,” says Ms Martin.

“New Zealand First wants to encourage parents and families with students who have high complex needs to ask about this option for their girls. Salisbury Residential School is one of the options under the banner of the Intensive Wraparound Service when community-based services are just not appropriate.

“While all applications must go through the Ministry of Education we strongly recommend that parents contact the school and ask to visit before making any decision for your child,” says Ms Martin.
