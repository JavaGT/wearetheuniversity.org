Student Loan Changes Will Add To Mass Aussie Exodus

**Student Loan Changes Will Add To Mass Aussie Exodus**

New Zealand First says the Government ditching its own student loan repayment bonus scheme introduced just two years ago is symptomatic of an economy that has come off the rails.

Associate Finance spokesperson Andrew Williams says repealing the loan bonus scheme sends a grim message to tertiary students.

“Students are being told that they will not be rewarded by staying in this country and paying off their student loans early.

“No wonder students are marching in the streets showing their frustration at the poor direction of this Government.”

Mr Williams says students will continue to desert the country in droves unless they have an incentive to repay their loans.

“New Zealand First would introduce a scheme in which the Government matches each dollar repaid by students.

“The programme would more than pay for itself as students would work and pay tax in New Zealand.”
