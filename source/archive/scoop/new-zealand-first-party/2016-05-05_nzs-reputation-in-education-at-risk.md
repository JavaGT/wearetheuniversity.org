NZ’s Reputation in Education at Risk

NZ’s Reputation in Education at Risk

Fraud and corruption in New Zealand’s international education industry is damaging the country’s reputation, says New Zealand First.

“Agents touting for students to pay for education in New Zealand are submitting false documents to secure student visas,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“The government must take action to ensure tertiary education providers only accept students with legitimate documentation.

“At least one institution has advised teaching staff to avoid officially recording marks in order to scale marks up to a pass,” says Mrs Martin.

“If this government wants to preserve the integrity of the export education sector, then they need to ensure that the mechanisms we have in place are robust enough to deter agents and students from committing fraud,” says Mrs Martin.

“We know that some students have always used their study visas as a pathway to permanent residency. Over 85,000 international students have been granted residency since 2009. In other words, it is not qualifications they are seeking but another country to live in.”
