A Message To Visitors: Offend On Our Roads Then Home You Go

“There needs to be a strong message to all foreign students in this country, indeed all people who come here on a temporary basis,” said Transport spokesperson Peter Brown.

“Drive a vehicle without a license to do so and the individual will be on the first plane out. No ifs, buts or maybes. It is not acceptable for anyone to drive on our roads who is not licensed appropriately. Whilst we cannot expel our own we can show the door to those who are here on a temporary basis.

“Frankly, we are too much of a soft touch in this country and we need to harden up. The unfortunate and regrettable death of Ms Lester should be a lesson to us all. We must not wait until someone else is killed by an overstayer or visitor – one driving offence and out – no appeals – just a one way ticket to wherever they came from,” said Mr Brown
