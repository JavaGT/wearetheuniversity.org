Budget Bribery Brings Window of False Hope

**Budget Bribery Brings Window of False Hope**

New Zealand First is astounded with the Government’s remark that this is a “family-friendly budget.”

“There’s nothing friendly about it except to manipulate voters toward National,” says Spokesperson for Social Policy Le’aufa’amulia Asenati Lole-Taylor.

“Unemployment remains high, offset by a larger labour force. The Budget contains no job creation and this should have been a priority.

“The most vulnerable people in our society do not have a better chance of getting jobs.

“They will have to wait at least until 2018 to see if employment prospects improve in their favour, but New Zealand families need jobs now for their education, health and overall wellbeing.  
“New Zealand First has been calling for free doctors’ visits for children in primary school for years.

“National has adopted New Zealand First’s policy but has failed to give it the commitment it deserves.

“While the extra funding benefits sick children, it does not mean anything if they have to wait more than a year to get it.

“We believe that when families are stable and healthy, children will receive proper care and support.

“The child is not properly protected if mum and dad are suffering from the unaffordable cost of living because this budget does nothing to create secure employment with higher wages for people on low incomes.

“The Government’s surplus is nothing to gloat about when thousands of New Zealand families continue to live in hardship and remain unemployed,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
