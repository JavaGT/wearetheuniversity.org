“Too Little, Too Late” for Christchurch Home Owners

**“Too Little, Too Late” for Christchurch Home Owners**

News that the Residential Advisory Service will assist Christchurch home owners with insurance problems from tomorrow is a case of too little, too late for many of those affected says New Zealand First.

It has now been 27 months since the February 2011 earthquake, when most of the damage to houses occurred.

Spokesperson for Christchurch Earthquake Issues Denis O’Rourke says that in those months, thousands of Cantabrians have been struggling with a bewildering range of serious insurance problems.

“Many homeowners have had to resort to the courts in order to get action on their insurance claims.

“Others cannot afford the time, effort, cost and stress that is involved and have just given up.

“The new advisory service is welcome, but it should have been set up two years ago.

Mr O’Rourke recommends that the service provide a limited advocacy service where it is justified in specific cases.

“In addition there should be special provisions made for expanded legal aid eligibility for advice on insurance issues.

“The Government's delayed response to the insurance needs of Cantabrians is another headache that those affected don’t need to deal with,” says Mr O’Rourke.
