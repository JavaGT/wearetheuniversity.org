Nats Care More About Money Than Special Needs Children

**Nats Care More About Money Than Special Needs Children**

New Zealand First says National’s slash and burn approach to education is again seeing special needs students suffering unnecessary hardship.

The latest blunder is linked to significant problems with the taxi company contracted by the Government to transport special needs students to and from school.

There are media reports claiming some taxis are arriving late, not showing up at all, or dropping off physically disabled children at the end of driveways.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government is slashing care for special needs students while in the process of setting up Charter Schools to make profits.

“This is just another example of the rationalisation of the education dollar that has seen the closure of special schools and the reduction of classroom assistance for these special needs students.

“Once again the Government is showing us what it truly believes….it’s all about the money.

“The Government’s rhetoric about caring for children does not match its actions,” Ms Martin says.
