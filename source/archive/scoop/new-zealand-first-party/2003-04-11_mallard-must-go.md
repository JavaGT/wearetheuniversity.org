Mallard Must Go

“Political bovver boy Trevor Mallard may have his value as a Prime Ministerial minder but his days as Education Minister must be numbered,” said New Zealand First education spokesperson Brian Donnelly.

“Two new reports show that Mr Mallard has presided over a failing education system where teacher shortages are effecting over 40 percent of secondary schools.

“This is having a devastating effect on our children with the latest literacy figures putting the literacy gap between kiwi boys and girls as worst equal with Iran and Belize.

“This is astounding and totally unacceptable. Mr Mallard has to be held accountable for these appalling results.

“We once led the world in literacy and now fall below Lithuania and rank second worst in the English-speaking world.

“Our secondary schools are overcrowded with over 12,000 foreign fee paying students this year putting enormous pressure on the infrastructure and resources.

“With Maori again over-represented as under-performing students we need to be concentrating the use of our resources on our own students.

“The relationship between the Government and teachers has hit an all time low and we are facing a disaster in our education system that has not been seen before and where the real losers are our children and our economy.

“Mr Mallard must go,” said Mr Donnelly.
