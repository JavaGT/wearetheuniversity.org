World Cancer Day a Time to Rehink Sun Bed Laws

World Cancer Day a Time to Rehink Sun Bed Laws

  
World Cancer Day is a reminder for the National government to reconsider its position and ban commercial sun beds, says New Zealand First.

“The evidence is strong that voluntary safety guidelines are not working in the industry with over half the sunbed operators refusing to follow them,” says Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“Ministry of Health statistics show that New Zealand has one of the highest rates of melanoma in the world with about 2200 people diagnosed with melanoma every year.

“The high UV levels in New Zealand are a known problem, we do not need the added risk of sun beds.

“New Zealand First commends the Palmerston North City Council for its intention to make a submission to Parliament’s Health Select Committee on the Health (Protection) Amendment Bill which seeks to ban sun bed use by those under 18 years of age.

“The council is seeking a total ban on sun beds which New Zealand First supports.

“A recent University of Sydney study found that the use of sunbeds by 18-39 year olds increased their risk of developing melanoma by an average of 41 per cent,” says Mrs Stewart.
