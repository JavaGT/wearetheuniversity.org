Declare Drought Now
===================

**Richard Prosser MP**

Spokesperson for Primary Industries

**Declare Drought Now**

As dry conditions are taking grip on many farms the Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy needs to take the bull by the horns and declare regional and local adverse events, says New Zealand First.

“In other words, it is time to say officially there is a drought,” says Primary Industries Spokesperson Richard Prosser. “By doing this they can get some financial support through the Rural Support Trusts.

“The financial burden caused by events such as droughts and floods is high for farmers and this affects the farm service businesses, their communities as a whole and the national economy.

“This is why the national network of Rural Support Trusts was set up in 1988. These trusts are funded annually and extra funding is granted in adverse events.

“Our farmers deserve support from the Minister, especially dairy farmers who are taking a double hit - crippling dry conditions and stress from a forecast pay-out well below the recommended breakeven amount.

“Soil moisture levels along the entire east coast are traditionally low at this time of year, but what we’re seeing is an exception.

“South Canterbury farmers were particularly affected with low rainfall in December and greatly reduced snowmelt for the rivers.

“Whilst some farmers make provision in their farming systems for a continued dry spell at this time of year, the soil moisture levels started out low and forecasters are expecting it to get worse.

“Farmers aren’t the sort of people to put their hands out unless things are truly dire, and we don’t want to see anyone waiting till it’s too late before they ask for help. Government needs to see the reality out there and act to pre-empt what could be a coming crisis.”

“It’s time to support farmers. They need it, the economy needs it,” says Mr Prosser.
