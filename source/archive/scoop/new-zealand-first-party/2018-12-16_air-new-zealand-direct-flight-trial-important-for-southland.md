Air New Zealand Direct Flight Trial Important for Southland

Air New Zealand Direct Flight Trial Important for Southland

New Zealand First applauds the announcement today by Air New Zealand to trial a direct service between Invercargill and Auckland from the second half of 2019.

“This is an important service being offered to Southland and these regular flights will help connect the region to our largest centre. Southland is an amazing part of the country and this improved accessibility will help us show the world all that the south has to offer,” says New Zealand First List MP based in Clutha-Southland, Mark Patterson.

The announcement is a response to calls from the Southland community to bring the service to Invercargill. The service includes a morning flight to Auckland, as well as a night flight to Invercargill using their Airbus A320 jet aircraft.

“An increase in visitor numbers will stimulate the local economy, increasing prospects for job growth and boosting the tourism industry. Increasing access to Auckland for Southland business also improves business and trading prospects for our community. This will also relieve infrastructure pressure off Queenstown, providing a sustainable, alternate air link to Fiordland, Southland and Central Otago,”

“It is great to see Air New Zealand promoting the regions as this route will serve the best interests of Southland. Hopefully it will become permanent,” says Mr Patterson.
