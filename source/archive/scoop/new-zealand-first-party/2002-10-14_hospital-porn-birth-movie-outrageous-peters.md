Hospital Porn Birth Movie "Outrageous" Says Peters

New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters has called on the Minister of Health Annette King to immediately stop a birth being filmed in a public hospital for a pornographic movie.

A court last week gave a pregnant stripper the go-ahead to be filmed giving birth for the movie provided that the baby was not shown in the film .

“We all know that fathers are encouraged to be present at a birth but this is insane,” said Mr Peters.

He said the court ruling was a nonsense and could not be enforced were it not that New Zealand was so politically correct that “this kind of rubbish” could happen here.

Mr Peters said that many of the Waikato district health board’s former patients would be surprised to learn that it had so much space and resources that it could allow them to be wasted on a porno film crew.

“The Minister has to intervene and intervene now.

“Most New Zealanders will be outraged if this filming goes ahead in a facility funded by taxpayers for the health of the community.

“Medical staff should not be caught up in pornography and hospital authorities have no right to let them become involved.

“Annette King should step in now and say no. What could the court do? Jail the doctors and nurses?” asked Mr Peters.
