Labour Abandons Workers

New Zealand First has condemned the Government’s likely decision to remove import barriers in the footwear, clothing, and textile industries.

“The removal of tariffs will take jobs away from vulnerable communities and threaten families. These industries employ thousands, many of whom are women. This ideological move is final confirmation, if any was required, that the Labour Party has given up on working people and abandoned its roots,” said Deputy Leader, Peter Brown.

“This move should surely test the support of the Greens and United Future which has long since sold out New Zealand families. Not content with destroying the country’s social fabric Labour is now going full ahead on the economic restructuring begun in 1984.

“Why this Government insists on leading the world in dubious causes we cannot comprehend. Future tariff removal must be consistent with the policies and progress of our trading partners. We must aim to win the export and employment stakes, not some artificial tariff removal race,” said Mr Brown.
