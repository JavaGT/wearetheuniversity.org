Search All Asian Students Says Mark

Search All Asian Students Says Mark

New Zealand First has called on the Government to increase the number of border surveillance staff at airports and start searching all Asian students to stop them bringing in flu pills for making methamphetamine.

This follows a report that Asian students are flying into Auckland with thousands of the pills for illegal “P” factories and that border officials are struggling to cope.

Law and order spokesperson Ron Mark says any students caught with the pills should be immediately sent home in disgrace and their governments notified so they can take “appropriate” action.

“New Zealand has a serious P problem and it is a total affront for these students to come here and create social mayhem so they can make money at the expense of the society of their host country.

“Over the past few years many of these people have shown that they have a different standard of morality to ordinary New Zealanders. Unfortunately it appears that some education providers and the Government are not too concerned about the type of people they are letting in to study here.”

Mr Mark said that Customs activity should also be stepped up to stop mail order imports of flu pills for drug manufacturing.

“By making Auckland an Asian colony, the Government has allowed an alien crime culture develop that threatens the fabric of society. The Police and Customs Ministers have to act before it is too late,” said Mr Mark.
