Government Listens To New Zealand First

New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters is relieved the Government has followed New Zealand First’s policy prescription yet again with its decision to regulate immigration advisers.

This follows the announcement of the Immigration Advisers Licensing Bill which was tabled in Parliament today requiring the licensing of all immigration advisers.

“The immigration industry has long been crying out for regulation and serious scrutiny,” said Mr Peters “The number of rip-off merchants who prey on unsuspecting applicants is truly shocking.

“Action must also be taken to fight the issuing of false documentation, from driver’s licences through to university degrees. “This has long been part of New Zealand First’s policy as both National and Labour have betrayed the birthright of all New Zealanders through mindless policies of allowing thousands of immigrants to come here with ill thought for the consequences. “They are finally realising their folly,” said Mr Peters.
