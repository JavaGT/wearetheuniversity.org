Some Thoughts From New Zealand First Candidate Stu Husband

**Some thoughts from me as advance voting begins**

Stu Husband, New Zealand First Candidate for the Waikato Electorate

Today marks the start of advanced voting for this year’s general election. I would like to make some things clear on why you should consider first and foremost voting for New Zealand First for your party vote, and voting for me as Your Electorate Member of Parliament.

Firstly, that the Waikato Electorate needs a local MP that has the experience and knowledge of the reality for this Electorate. I have this experience as a long time resident, farmer, and Waikato Regional Councillor. It is this knowledge that will get gains for the Electorate. My focus is the advancement of the people of the Electorate and standing up for our interests at Parliament and in the political party I belong to.

Secondly, the thing is the perception that the Party is only about one person. This is completely false. It’s made of thousands of members that work together to defend the rights and development of our country. So if you’re undecided and this is something that is off putting, know that it is a group of people focused that do not have their hands tied. Like any organisation it’s not perfect, but it does represent and advocate the needs and interests of a big range of people and this country.

Thirdly, is that every voter must look through is the smoke and mirrors and empty election promises that all other political parties are presenting. The policies being presented on water, river quality, agriculture, and crime by other parties do not stack up at all. I know this because I have been working in these areas in great depth, and know first-hand the actual reality of these challenges. So when I hear others spouting off about these matters, that have little experience and knowledge of them, we must think critically about this.

Fourthly, no matter who is in Government, the Electorate needs someone that will stand-up and fight for it. New Zealand First is well known for fighting hard and I am also like that as well. Combine these two things together and the Electorate will be well represented.

Finally, I will mention the question of which party New Zealand First will go with. The leadership will make the call once they have all the information to hand. This is not sinister in anyway, quite the opposite in fact. The Party does not want to make commitments or promises to the country that are not based on fact and evidence. So please do not pay attention to the hype in the media and online, and know that this is about keeping things transparent and not raising unrealistic expectations.

Party vote New Zealand First and vote for me as your Member of Parliament.

  
ENDS
