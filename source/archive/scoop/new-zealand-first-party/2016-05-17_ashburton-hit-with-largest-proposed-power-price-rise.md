Ashburton Hit with Largest Proposed Power Price Rise

Ashburton Hit with Largest Proposed Power Price Rise

  
Ashburton’s 18,709 electricity consumers will face the largest average price increases in New Zealand at almost $449 a connection under proposals put out today by the Electricity Authority, says New Zealand First.

“The proposal comes from a review of Transpower’s Pricing Methodology which is demanding $8.4 million in total from Ashburton consumers,” says New Zealand First Energy and Commerce Spokesperson Fletcher Tabuteau.

“It’s a nasty shock for dairy and arable farmers given larger power users will pay more than smaller ones.

“Dairy farmers will be looking at their budgets again as they face a third season of losses, with the dairy payout still down.

“Where is the supportive government when an unelected body, such as the authority, which purports to be acting to benefit the consumer, proposes such harsh increases?

“It should step in and demand smoothing of prices across the country, in fairness for all. There’s money from grid owner Transpower’s profit last year of $194 million to do that.”
