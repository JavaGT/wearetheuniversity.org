NZ Nurses Struggling to Find Jobs

NZ Nurses Struggling to Find Jobs in Underfunded Health Sector

New Zealand First is calling for an immediate halt to overseas nursing recruitment and an increase to the number of Nurse Entry to Practice programme places to ensure that Kiwi trained nurses find employment in New Zealand.

“The New Zealand Nurses’ Organisation says hundreds of nurses are unable to gain employment in New Zealand after graduation,” says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“More nurses are needed in an over-stretched system, under pressure from funding cuts and uncontrolled immigration. To hear that a huge pool of talent is going to waste is disconcerting.

“Many New Zealanders are concerned that graduate nurses can’t get jobs while DHBs recruit foreign-trained nurses.

“It’s unfair. After three years training the NZ graduates have big student loans to pay off.

“New Zealand First would develop a training programme which enables graduate nurses to enter full-time nursing roles as soon as possible after they graduate so that they are able to gain the experience needed.

“DHBs must be supported to employ Kiwi nursing graduates,” says Mrs Stewart.
