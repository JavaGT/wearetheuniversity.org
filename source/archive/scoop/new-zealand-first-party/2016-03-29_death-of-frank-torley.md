Death of Frank Torley

New Zealand broadcasting, particularly rural broadcasting, has lost a legend with the passing of Frank Torley.

"Frank was an iconic member of New Zealand's broadcasting scene who brought our rural way of life in to thousands of living rooms for over 40 years," says Primary Industries Spokesperson Richard Prosser.

"Frank told the stories of farmers and the rural communities who support them and in doing so he was instrumental in connecting urban New Zealand with the rural sector.

"Frank Torley will be missed. We pass on our thoughts to his family, friends and the TVNZ Country Calendar team.”
