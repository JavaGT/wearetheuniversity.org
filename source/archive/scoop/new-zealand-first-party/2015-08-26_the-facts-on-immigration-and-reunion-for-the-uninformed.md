The Facts on Immigration And Parent Reunion for the Uninformed

New Zealand First says Shamubeel Eaqub, who describes himself as an economist, should get real.

He was too quick in his attempt to try and insult New Zealand First on TV One’s Q&A programme in a discussion on immigration.

“Covering up lack of knowledge by using an expletive is far from convincing,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Mr Peters.

“He had not done his homework.

“The rate of family reunion to New Zealand is high compared with other countries. Immigration expert and academic Professor Paul Spoonley says the number of ageing Chinese migrants are a serious concern.

“Since 2000, over 79,000 people above the age of 50 have come here to live, many from countries that have no state pension or reciprocal system.

“After 10 years they have become eligible for NZ Super at the age of 65.

“Two younger people, who may themselves have a family making demands on the country’s infrastructure, will never add to the ‘fiscal’ pool anywhere near balancing the cost of NZ Super for their four parents,” says Mr Peters.

“For others who are interested in doing research before publicly giving an opinion, the graphs will be informative,” says Mr Peters.
