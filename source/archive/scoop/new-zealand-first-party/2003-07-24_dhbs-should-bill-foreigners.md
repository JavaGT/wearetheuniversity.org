DHBs Should Bill Foreigners

New Zealand First health spokesperson Pita Paraone fully supports the Auckland DHBs decision to ask foreign patients to provide proof of their eligibility to free treatment and urges all district health boards to follow suit.

“We cannot afford to spend thousands of dollars to treat seriously ill foreigners who are not eligible for free treatment,” said Mr Paraone.

“New Zealand’s health system is bursting at the seams, with New Zealanders missing out on essential care and foreigners receiving free medical care, this is outrageous and it is about time that something was done about it.

“I applaud Auckland DHB for taking the initiative, especially after having to write-off $1.3 million in unpaid debts from foreign patients.

“I strongly urge other DHBs around the country to do the same and ensure that New Zealanders get the medical treatment they deserve and do not miss out because of massive debts racked up by un-paying foreigners,” said Mr Paraone.
