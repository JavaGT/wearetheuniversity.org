Dispatch Brownlee to Canberra with an Apology Note
==================================================

**DISPATCH BROWNLEE TO CANBERRA WITH AN APOLOGY NOTE**

New Zealand First wants Foreign Affairs Minister Gerry Brownlee to take a note signed by all political parties, with the exception of New Zealand First, apologising for the country’s shambolic immigration policy which led to tens of thousands moving to Australia.

“We cannot blame Australia for cracking down on the influx, as we allowed ourselves to be used as a stepping stone,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The latest measure means Kiwi students from Kiwi families will pay full fees at Australian universities. This follows the 2001 clampdown and other measures.

“New Zealand was for years in the 1990s, 2000, and 2001 being used as a launching pad into Australia by new immigrants. Labour and National and the other parties all turned a blind eye whilst allowing immigrants to use our country to enter Australia, and never consulted Australia whilst we were doing so. Tens of thousands came in here, got residency and shot off to Australia.

“The crocodile tears from National, Labour, Greens, the Maori Party, and the Act Party are loaded with hypocrisy.

“They are the ones who have been cheerleaders for rampant immigration. They should own up to being responsible for this mess, which New Zealand First for years warned would have repercussions.

“The immigration policy has to be fixed first and then Mr Brownlee dispatched with a signed apologetic note to Canberra saying we are sorry, and New Zealand will not do it again.”

Mr Peters says that only then can Mr Brownlee ask the Australian government: “Can we please have our special Anzac relationship restored.”

“It is tiresome to observe the cheerleaders of rampant immigration failing to own up to their myopic stupidity.

“It is not the Australians who are being ‘dingoistic’ here but those who were the architects of our people becoming second-class citizens in Australia.”
