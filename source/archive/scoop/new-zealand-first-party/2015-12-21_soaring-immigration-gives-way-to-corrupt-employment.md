Soaring Immigration Gives Way to Corrupt Employment
===================================================

**Monday, 21 December 2015, 4:11 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland

Soaring Immigration Gives Way to Corrupt Employment  

  
New Zealand First says workplace corruption and exploitation of vulnerable workers will thrive unless the government stops the flood of migrants settling in New Zealand.

“Record breaking immigration numbers have continued with a net gain of 63,700 migrants in the November 2015 year,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“This comes as the Labour Inspectorate today confirmed widespread breaches of New Zealand labour standards, which could involve hundreds of employers throughout the country.

“The Labour Inspectorate cited an ‘inadequacy of record keeping’ by rogue employers. In other words, they’re talking about blatant fraud and this must be stopped.

“The proliferation of student visas, up more than 5,000 since last year, will only add fuel to the fire as rogue employers target migrant students desperate to stay here.

“It is clear that there must be more oversight of employers, more regular inspections and raids, stiffer penalties, and immigration at a level that can be controlled.

“Convicted employers, if new immigrants, should be sent home,” says Mr Peters.
