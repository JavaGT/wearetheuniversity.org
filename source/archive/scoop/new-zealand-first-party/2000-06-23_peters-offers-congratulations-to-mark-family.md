PETERS OFFERS CONGRATULATIONS TO MARK FAMILY

  
The Rt Hon Winston Peters MP, Leader of New Zealand First, today noted the graduation of Wing 190 from the Royal New Zealand Police College this afternoon.

“Paul Mark, the son of Ron Mark, New Zealand First Spokesperson for Law and Order, graduated within the Wing and is pleased to be posted to Christchurch where the Mark family have lived for almost 20 years.

“Paul comes from a long list of family members who have served in the New Zealand Police including his Great Uncle and Grandfather.

“New Zealand First’s commitment to Law and Order is further reinforced with both Ron Mark and Party President Doug Woolerton each having sons serving with the New Zealand Police.

“I pass my sincere congratulations on to Paul and his family and wish him well in his new career,” said Mr Peters.
