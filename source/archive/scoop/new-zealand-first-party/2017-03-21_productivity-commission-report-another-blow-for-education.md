Productivity Commission Report Another Blow for Education

National is determined to make tertiary education unobtainable to ordinary New Zealanders, says New Zealand First.

“The Productivity Commission’s report on Tertiary Education is extremely disappointing, but not at all surprising,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“The report does nothing to help tertiary education, which isn’t surprising given the contempt the National government holds for public education in this country.

“It appears the commission has been brainwashed by the concept that our young people must place themselves in financial debt to gain tertiary education. Too many students already have to borrow to live. This is wrong.

“Unlike the National government, New Zealand First wants to help our young people into education. Our UpFront Investment Tertiary policy makes education obtainable, with a skill debt instead of a financial debt.

“Our policy, which includes a universal student allowance, will stop the millions of dollars being spent on administering Studylink and the writing off of bad debts.

“The Commission was created by the National government and they are simply doing its bidding for them.

“To suggest the recommendations are a surprise and the Commission did anything other than stick to the briefing they received from the National government is folly,” says Mrs Martin

New Zealand First’s UpFront Investment Tertiary policy is attached.
