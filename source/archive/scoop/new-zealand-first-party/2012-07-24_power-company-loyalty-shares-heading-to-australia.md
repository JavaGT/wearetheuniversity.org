Power Company Loyalty Shares Heading to Australia

**Power Company Loyalty Shares Heading to Australia**

New Zealand First says the Government’s sale of state-owned power companies is getting more bizarre as each day goes by.

State Owned Enterprises associate spokesperson Andrew Williams says the Government appears to be making up its policy on the fly.

“Finance Minister Bill English admitted in Parliament today that New Zealanders who buy a $2000 parcel of shares and then leave the country will not only get to keep their shares but also receive loyalty bonus shares.

“National sees nothing wrong with selling off assets currently owned by all New Zealanders who then flee in their thousands to Australia for a brighter future.”

Mr Williams says New Zealand First’s position has not changed and it remains totally opposed to the sale of state owned power companies.

“We intend to use our influence if we are part of the next Government to buy back the assets for no more than their original sale price.”
