United Future Backflips On Seabed Bill

United Future Backflips On Seabed Bill

New Zealand First MP Dail Jones says ports companies and recreational users of the foreshore and seabed will be bitterly disappointed by the actions of the United Future Party in failing to make a contribution to the select committee process on the Foreshore and Seabed Bill.

United Future has signalled it will not provide the crucial vote needed to reach a majority agreement on the select committee report back to Parliament due in November.

Mr Jones, who is a member of the committee hearing submissions on the Bill, said he believes the following issues must be considered by the select committee:

the question of the leasing of reclaimed land; the Department of Conservation’s potential authority to prevent recreational use of the foreshore and seabed; marginal strips and the Conservation Department.

“New Zealand First is prepared to make decisions on these issues without the support of United Future or National, Act and the Greens,” said Mr Jones.

“The United Future Party spent thousands of taxpayers dollars recently saying it supported Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed, but this advertising appears to be a waste of money,” concluded Mr Jones.
