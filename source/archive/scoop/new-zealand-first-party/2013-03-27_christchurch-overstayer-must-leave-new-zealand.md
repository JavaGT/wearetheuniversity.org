Christchurch Overstayer Must Leave New Zealand
==============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

  
**Rt Hon Winston Peters**  
New Zealand First Leader

**Christchurch Overstayer Must Leave New Zealand**

New Zealand First is asking why the Government hasn’t kicked out overstayer Harmon Wilfred who remains living in Christchurch despite failing twice to be granted NZ citizenship.

Mr Wilfred was also declined refugee status after he renounced his US citizenship after claiming there was a vendetta against him by high-placed US officials.

This week it was revealed that Mr Wilfred’s main trading company, La Famia No 2 Ltd, was put into liquidation owing nearly $300,000 to Inland Revenue. General creditors are owed $246,000.

Mr Wilfred’s business affairs in New Zealand are littered with similar financial disasters.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says there is no way Mr Wilfred should still be living in New Zealand.

“He is an overstayer.

“He has no legal right to be living here yet the Government has done nothing to move him on.

“The folly of that decision can now be counted in taxpayer dollars through his failed company.”

“Reading Mr Wilfred’s turgid history beggars belief.”

Mr Peters says Mr Wilfred received the support of National MP David Carter, now the Speaker of the House, to remain in this country.

“In his written letter of support Mr Carter praised Mr Wilfred for his ‘considerable business interests’, and said Mr Wilfred and his Canadian wife Carolyn Dare-Wilfred were ‘committed, contributing members of our Christchurch community’.

“Let’s see if Mr Carter will reiterate that support to Mr Wilfred’s former employees, general creditors, and Inland Revenue who are collectively owed hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“The reality is Mr Wilfred should either seek Canadian residency so he can legally live there with his wife, or the Government should deport him to the US.

“There should be no ifs, buts, or maybes. Mr Wilfred is an overstayer who must be dealt with now,” says Mr Peters.
