**Follow Salisbury’s Lead Says NZ First**

New Zealand First says Salisbury School and its supporters are an inspiration to all Kiwis fighting for decent treatment for young people less fortunate than themselves.

Disability spokesperson Barbara Stewart says she is congratulating the Salisbury group for ensuring the special needs school remains open.

“We’re sorry for the losses and hardship the school had to go to for recognition of the integral part they play in the lives of the students.

“But it shows that a group of determined people can fight the heartless decisions of a mean-spirited government and win for the underdogs.

Mrs Stewart says Education Minister Hekia Parata had previously ignored the safety of these girls in her decision to close the school but it is pleasing she has seen the merits of the case.

“New Zealand First fully supports Salisbury School, and will keep in close contact to ensure the roll out of the new system will not create any further unnecessary disruptions for the students or staff.

“We hope Salisbury School take the public support as a sign of what a great and necessary job they are doing for some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable girls,” says Mrs Stewart
