Asian Survey Result Sad But Predictable

New Zealand First has described the results of a Human Rights Commission survey that identified Asians as the group most discriminated against as “sad but predictable”.

Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said tonight that the research result was inevitable given the flood of mainly Asian immigrants that the Government had brought into New Zealand last year.

“Research throughout the world on this subject has shown the same result. It is madness to flood a country with thousands of people from a totally foreign country and not expect some backlash.

“The people to blame for this are Helen Clark and Lianne Dalziel. Their cheerleader, Joris de Bres, is blaming ordinary New Zealanders for becoming alarmed about a situation over which they feel powerless.

Mr Peters said a sensible population policy would mean fewer migrants who would have a better chance of blending with New Zealand society with a minimum of stress.

“The situation is going to get a lot worse unless the Government acts promptly,” he said.
