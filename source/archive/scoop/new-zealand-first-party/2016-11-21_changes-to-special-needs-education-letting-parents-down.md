**PIECEMEAL CHANGES TO SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION LETTING PARENTS DOWN**

Special needs education requires major reform, not just piecemeal changes as proposed, says New Zealand First.

“There have been hours of emotional and passionate oral submissions from parents, teachers and students calling for major system change, but the National Government refuses to listen,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“We have joined with Labour and Green Party members of Parliament’s education and science select committee in adding a minority view on a recently released report on support for students challenged by dyslexia, dyspraxia and autism.

“Unfortunately, while the full select committee was able to agree on a large number of recommendations it was New Zealand First’s view, shared by the Green Party and the Labour Party, that the true level of change needed was not appropriately reflected to ensure that this obviously broken system is finally addressed.

“We cannot accept that the required changes are unaffordable when the Ministry of Education does not understand the need as they do not collect such data.

“New Zealand First specifically included in the minority report a requirement to widen screening tools and the collection by the Ministry of school entry data to improve decision making on which funding is based.

“Also, this group of parents and students should have access to the full range of educational options and this would include single-sex residential schools, such as Salisbury School in Nelson, which the Minister is threatening to close,” says Ms Martin.
