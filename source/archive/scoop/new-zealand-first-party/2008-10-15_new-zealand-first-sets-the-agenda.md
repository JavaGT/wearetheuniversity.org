New Zealand First Sets The Agenda

New Zealand will be run on New Zealand First policies over the next few years said Rt Hon Winston Peters today.

“That is the only conclusion which can be drawn from the adoption of our major policies by both Labour and National,” said Mr Peters.

“While we understand imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, credit should be given where it’s due.

“Today, National announced they would direct the New Zealand Super Fund to invest at least 40 percent of its funds in New Zealand infrastructure. That is a longstanding New Zealand First policy.

“On Monday, Labour announced a universal student allowance scheme – another longstanding New Zealand First policy.

“On Sunday, Labour announced an insurance scheme for deposits in our financial institutions. This is a policy New Zealand First has been talking about for months.

“Both parties now want to ban criminal gangs. This is yet another New Zealand First policy.

“New Zealand First has always had policies that are aimed at growing our economy, investing in our future and protecting our communities. It has taken international financial uncertainty for Labour and National to see the importance of such policies.

“We look forward to them now adopting more New Zealand First ideas – especially a reduction in GST, a tax-free threshold on the first $100 of income and a re-write of the Reserve Bank Act to benefit our exporters.

“If anyone wants to know which policy the two major parties might announce next, just read the rest of the New Zealand First policy manifesto for some clues,” said Mr Peters.
