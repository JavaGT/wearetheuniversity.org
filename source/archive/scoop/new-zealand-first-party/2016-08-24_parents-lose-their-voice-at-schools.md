Parents Lose Their Voice at Schools

**Parents Lose Their Voice at Schools as Minister Adopts Dictatorial Approach**

The voice of parents, students and the community is being legislated out of education, says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“The Education Minister is removing the charter from Tomorrow’s Schools and will be able to behave like a dictator under the New Education (Update) Amendment Bill which the government introduced yesterday.

“At present, state schools’ Board of Trustees are required to consult their community and develop a charter that reflects the goals and aspirations of the parents and students of their school community over a three-to-five year period.

“The Bill puts in new reporting requirements and provisions for school boards to comply with national performance measures.

“The Minister will also have the power to appoint the board chair under certain circumstances.

“This new iron-fisted approach appears to be in response to schools that refused to do as they were told by the Minister.

“One of the burning questions New Zealand First has is where is the voice of the School Trustees Association in all this? After gaining a large training contract from this Minister they are remarkably silent.”
