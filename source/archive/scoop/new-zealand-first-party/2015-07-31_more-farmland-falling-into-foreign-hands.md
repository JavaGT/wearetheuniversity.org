**More Farmland Falling into Foreign Hands, Despite English Saying Only Kiwi Farmers Can Make a Profit**

Finance Minister Bill English admits Kiwi farmers are the only ones who can make money out of New Zealand farms, yet we are still selling our land to foreigners, says New Zealand First.

“One of the latest sales approved is 355 hectares in Canterbury going into Swiss hands at a price of $10 million,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Bill English, a former farmer, was talking about Kiwi-owned farms, and Kiwi farmers who know their trade and have a love of the land. They look after the land for future generations.

“The new owners of Mayfield Farm, purchased from 100 per cent New Zealand-ownership, have no such attributes. They are an asset management company and will convert the land to a dairy farm.

“Sales of land are subject to approval, which is supposed to test the benefit to New Zealand. Clearly there is none if the Finance Minister is to be relied on.

“If Kiwis can do it, then the land needs to stay in our ownership. There’s absolutely no value from foreign ownership.

“We should also remember New Zealand farmers are recognised as some of the best in the world.

“Prime Minister John Key revealed this week that the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) will stop New Zealand banning non-resident buyers – but he was unconcerned.

“What possible long term benefits exist for New Zealand if National continues down this track when they know it is Kiwi ownership that will bring the rewards, not foreign farmers.”
