NZ First Supports Focus on Driver Licence Initiative
====================================================

Youth Affairs Spokesperson  
10 April 2019

  
New Zealand First welcomes a Coalition Government initiative to meet the cost of getting a driver licence for 2500 young people on youth benefits or in care.

“Reducing barriers for our young people in genuine need ensures that they have the tools necessary to get into work and become independent. The fact that 2500 youth will have their barriers reduced is most definitely welcomed,” says New Zealand First Youth Affairs Spokesperson Darroch Ball.

“We look forward to advancing the coalition agreement which also looks to ‘Offer free driver training to all secondary students’ - a long held New Zealand First policy. A large number of young people either don’t have access to a vehicle, or the cost of driver training is too high,” says Mr Ball.

“A driver’s licence is crucial for young people to connect to their communities and open doors to employment.”
