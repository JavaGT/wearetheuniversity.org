Wellington - Top Town Or Porn Town?
===================================

**Wednesday, 22 November 2000, 11:34 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Wellington’s reputation is in danger of becoming tarnished as a consequence of there being no effective security or supervision in the National Library public reading room.

Word is out among the thousands of visitors to the Capital, that if you’ve nothing better to do on a rest day, an hour or two’s unrestricted surfing of the world’s porn sites, courtesy of the taxpayer, with no restrictions as to what you choose to view, apparently can be really entertaining.

Rt Hon Winston Peters, Leader of New Zealand First said that it is a very comfortable way for backpackers to keep in touch with family and friends on the other side of the world, through accessing a free email service, again courtesy of New Zealand’s very generous taxpayers.

“Travellers can’t believe their luck when they are given the word from the street network, that the National Library facilities are there for the taking, no charges are levied and no restrictions are applied, in very comfortable surroundings.

“If Wellington’s user pays cyber cafes are finding business a bit slow at present, then I can tell them why.

“The National Library should clean up its act and ensure the services they provide are not able to continue to be abused in this manner,” Mr Peters concluded.
