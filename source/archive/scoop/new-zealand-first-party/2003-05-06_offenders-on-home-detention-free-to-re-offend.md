Offenders On Home Detention Free To Re-Offend

Offenders On Home Detention Free To Re-Offend

New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark is demanding a review of the Government’s home detention policy after being alerted to a case where an offender on home detention has been able to re-offend, causing severe distress to his victim and her family.

“The convicted criminal applied for home detention and although both his family and police expressed grave concerns over the individual’s suitability for home detention and the mental state of the proposed guardian, the Parole Board approved the application.

“Not only was this offender able to move house from Marlborough to Canterbury whilst on home detention but he has also caused bodily harm to his guardian, incurred serious debt for her and has more recently threatened to use physical violence against his guardian, her family and their property,” explained Mr Mark.

“Police are aware of the situation and have even gone as far as expressing concern for the guardian’s safety and yet the offender is still not locked up.

“You cannot ask for more evidence than this to prove that the Government’s home detention policy does not work,” said Mr Mark.

“To think that this offender is supposedly being punished is outrageous. The only people suffering are the victim and her family.

“The Government needs to turn the tables on offenders like this and put them back where they belong – in jail.”
