Peters warns against plastic immigration cards

New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters has called on the Immigration Minister to explain the electronic system she is considering introducing for processing overseas students, visitors and workers.

Lianne Dalziel revealed the process on television last night in response to the problems caused by the flood of applicants but offered no explanation about how the system would operate and how it would be policed.

“If this minister is thinking about handing out thousands of plastic cards to overseas visitors, students and workers, I would warn her to think again.

“She would simply be providing another opportunity for immigration fraud, which is already rife in this country, as evidenced by her own briefing papers from the Department of Labour.

“The real problem is the number of people coming into New Zealand and the dysfunctional Immigration Service,” said Mr Peters.
