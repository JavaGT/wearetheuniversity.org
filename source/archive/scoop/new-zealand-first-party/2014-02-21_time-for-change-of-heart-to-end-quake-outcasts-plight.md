Time for Change of Heart to End Quake Outcasts Plight

Time for Change of Heart to End Quake Outcasts Plight

With the third anniversary tomorrow of the devastating Canterbury earthquake New Zealand First is calling for a speedier resolution for the red-zoned residents who have been refused a full payout.

“Christchurch residents of the red zone are being forced out of their properties because the Government decided the area is no longer fit for homes,” says spokesperson for Christchurch Earthquake Issues Denis O’Rourke.

“Residents must move whether their property has minimal damage or substantial damage, it makes no difference.

“While many are receiving a payout equal to the 2007 valuation those who were uninsured or owned bare land have only been offered 50 per cent of the value.

“Through no fault of their own these people have had the market value of their property slashed by the Government’s decision to create the red zone,” says Mr O’Rourke.

“We call on Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee to re-visit his decision immediately and deliver a fair deal.

“The Quake Outcasts Group, representing around 70 people, has been fighting a long battle, taking their case to the United Nations and the courts but still the Minister ignores their plight.

“The High Court found that the 50 per cent offer was unjust and the ruling was backed by the Court of Appeal.

“It is time for the Government to offer a full payout at the 2007 land value and let people move on with their lives,” says Mr O’Rourke.
