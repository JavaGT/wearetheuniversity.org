Army’s Rifle Choice Positive Sign for Defence Procurement

New Zealand First is pleased to see the Ministry of Defence has selected LMT’s AR15 as the preferred weapon to replace the Steyr rifle in service with the army, navy and airforce.

“Our men and women will at last have access to a widely used battle-proven rifle,” says New Zealand First Defence Spokesperson Ron Mark.

“LMT-made rifles have a fantastic reputation for quality and reliability. The reports I have received confirm our view that it will become the best individual weapon system since the L1A1 SLR.

“The AR15 is the sort of battle proven weapon, which is capable of firing thousands of rounds without cleaning or stoppage. It reflects a new generation of rifles and we will benefit from ready access to support, development and configuration options.

“This is a positive choice as preferred rifle and preferred tenderer and a positive sign the Ministry of Defence is starting to get aspects of procurement right,” says Mr Mark.
