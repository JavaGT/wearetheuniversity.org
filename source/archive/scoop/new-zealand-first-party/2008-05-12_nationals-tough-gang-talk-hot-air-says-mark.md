National's Tough Gang Talk Hot Air Says Mark

National's ‘tough talk’ at the weekend to crack down on crime, on gangs and the ‘P’ epidemic is simply electioneering and has nothing to do with gang busting, says New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark.

Mr Mark said today that John Key's crime speech had everything to do with what focus groups are telling them and nothing to do with the problems of lawlessness in the community.

“National's record on gangs has always been soft. They legitimised them in the 1970s, creating a climate for the gangsters to flourish, and the whole country has been paying the price for this ever since.

“New Zealanders should ask National how they are going to cut taxes, cut government spending and then mount a war on gangs. Are they going to call for volunteers?”

Mr Mark said that National had consistently ridiculed New Zealand First's initiative to put a thousand extra police on the streets.

“They have also blocked every effort we have made on the law and order select committee to clamp down on crime.”

Mr Mark reminded National of the picture of their leader John Key pressing noses with alleged firearms offender Tame Iti at Waitangi.

“When his mate Iti was given leave to forget about his firearms charges and go on a taxpayer funded overseas trip, Mr Key said on the TV news that was fine.

“That about sums it up. National talks tough on crime but underneath is as soft as a half boiled egg,” said Mr Mark.
