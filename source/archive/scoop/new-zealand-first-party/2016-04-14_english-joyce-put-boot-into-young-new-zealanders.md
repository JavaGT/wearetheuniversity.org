English, Joyce Put Boot into Young New Zealanders

Government ministers Bill English and Steven Joyce have put the boot into young New Zealanders and given up on them which is insulting and totally unacceptable, says New Zealand First.

“Mr English says many young job seekers are ‘pretty damned hopeless’ and now we have Tertiary Education Minister Joyce saying, ‘forget about trying to train young Kiwis, we’ll import more IT graduates’,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Education Tracey Martin.

“Mr Joyce said the tertiary education system didn’t have the capacity to teach enough Kiwi students for the jobs available which is an indictment of both him and the system he oversees.

“Even he must realise the solution does not lie in bringing in more migrants; he is short-changing young Kiwis and obscuring the fact that adequate IT training should be available in New Zealand,” Mrs Martin says.
