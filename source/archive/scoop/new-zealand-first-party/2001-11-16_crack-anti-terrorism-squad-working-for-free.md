Media Release

16 November, 2001

PARLIAMENT’S CRACK ANTI-TERRORISM SQUAD WORKING FOR FREE.

New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters, has learned that Armourguard have been staffing the new anti-terrorist security force in Parliament with students who are working for free and are on work experience.

“It seems that since Parliament agreed to the contracting-out of the security of Parliament by the police, those who are protecting the capital have not received a cent. They are on work experience and allegedly receiving a training allowance for learning to be security guards instead,” said Mr Peters.

“Armourguard are being paid $45,000 a week to protect Parliament—where is all this money going?

“So much for a crack anti-terrorism squad.
