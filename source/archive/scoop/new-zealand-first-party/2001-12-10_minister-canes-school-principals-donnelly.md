Minister Canes School Principals - Donnelly
===========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

‘By buckling to PPTA demands to guarantee non-contact time within the secondary teachers’ contract, the Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard has made a rod for principals’ backs,’ said NZ First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly today.

‘Mr Mallard has gone for the cheap option but the result will be less flexibility for school administrators to use staff in the best manner to meet the learning needs of students. The range of courses, especially at senior levels, will be restricted.’

‘There are flow on effects into area schools where principals will be required to provide guaranteed non-contact time for those teaching primary classes.’

The settlement will do little to placate the anger of secondary teachers and will enhance the dissatisfaction of primary teachers when they see their area school colleagues with better conditions. All in all, this is a lose-lose situation’.
