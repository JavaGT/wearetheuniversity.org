Charter Schools Model Gets A ‘FAILED’ Mark

**Charter Schools Model Gets A ‘FAILED’ Mark**

A Northland school, misled and let down by the backers of charter schools, is now struggling with the outcome, says New Zealand First.

Spokesperson for education Tracey Martin says New Zealand First has sympathy for Te Kura Hourua O Whangarei Terenga Paraoa, the new Partnership School in Whangarei as the school appears to have been misled by the Government and the ACT Party.

“This school was known for the fabulous work they did with students who were disconnected from mainstream schooling. It enjoyed a close working partnership with other local schools.

“But the backers of charter schools seduced them and rushed them through the process to become a charter school.

“Now the school has discovered the so-called benefits fall well short of their expectations.

“They have also learned that as a charter school, set up by the National Government to bring competitive tension into education, they cannot expect to utilise other public education facilities.

“New Zealand First recognises the frustration for school’s seeking more flexibility and believes the legislation needs a rethink and indeed Te Kura Hourua O Whangarei Teranga Paraoa was considering this when they were pushed toward the new model.

“A re-write of the legislation around the special character provisions is the avenue the Government should have taken instead of sinking millions of dollars into the charter school model.

“New Zealand First will work with all stakeholders to stop this ridiculous competition which takes the focus away from the very students we are trying to assist,” says Ms Martin.
