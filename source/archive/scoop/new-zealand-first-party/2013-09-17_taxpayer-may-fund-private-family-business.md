Taxpayer May Fund Private Family Business

**Taxpayer May Fund Private Family Business**

Taxpayers may find themselves funding a private family business in the Government’s alarming experiment of charter schools says New Zealand First.

The Government today named the five charter schools which will be receiving $19 million in funding as outlined in the Budget this year.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says that the Vanguard Military School – which is being sponsored by Advance Training Centres - is owned by the Hyde Family, who have run a private school from 17A William Pickering Drive in Rosedale, Albany since 1995.

“The taxpayer may now find they are paying the costs to fund an existing business – a profit-making business the Hyde family were already running from their own dollar.

“The Government has stated that these schools were required because state schools were only successful for 4 out of 5 students – an 80% success rate.

“However the marketing for Advance Training Centres – a military prep school – proudly boasts that it also has an average of approximately 80% success rate.

“The Government has stated that charter schools will have to take all students that show up at their door but Advance Training marketing quite clearly states that students must be at a certain level of physical fitness, which may prohibit students with special needs or health issues from attending.

“The New Zealand taxpayer will be pumping money directly into the coffers of an established private family business.

“The Government is intent on openly undermining the state education system with its alarming experiment of charter schools with the taxpayer footing the bill”, says Ms Martin.
