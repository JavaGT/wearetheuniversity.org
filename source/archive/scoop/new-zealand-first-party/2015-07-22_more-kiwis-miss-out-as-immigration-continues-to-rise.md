More Kiwis Miss Out as Immigration Continues to Rise

More Kiwis Miss Out as Immigration Continues to Rise

The National government’s wholesale immigration policy is seriously limiting New Zealanders chances of finding a job and rental housing, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Every one of the 58,300 – or 1,121 coming to New Zealand each week, the net migration in the past year, require a place to live. That’s pressure on the rental and housing market, in addition to extra work and student visas forcing Kiwis to compete with newcomers for jobs,” says Mr Peter.

“Young Kiwis are missing out on low-skilled jobs as National has allowed about 100,000 foreign students to work. The number of low-skilled construction workers flying in for the Christchurch Rebuild is still climbing despite the government having plenty of time to train and upskill Kiwi workers. It is clear that the student visa and work visa are a path to citizenship as encouraged by the government.

“House rental prices and immigration levels have risen steeply alongside each other, but the government denies any connection.

“New Zealand First wants immigration wound back, and a stop to non-residents buying property.

“The government is trying to paint a rosy picture of the economy by pouring in migrants to fuel consumption. Mr Key and National have completely run out of ideas and think mass migration will disguise their economic failures,” says Mr Peters.
