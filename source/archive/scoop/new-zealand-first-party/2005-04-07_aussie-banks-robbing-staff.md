Aussie Banks Robbing Staff

New Zealand bank workers are being ripped off by Australian banks over pay and conditions compared to their Australian counterparts, which is symptomatic of how these banks treat New Zealanders, says Rt Hon Winston Peters.

Mr Peters was responding to Finsec’s decision to encourage thousands of New Zealand bank workers at National ANZ to strike tomorrow to get a fair deal from their Australian bosses.

“These Australian banks have been treating New Zealanders unfairly far too long and it is time someone stood up to them. They have been avoiding paying fair taxes for years and now they the want to underpay our workers.

“Making this situation worse is the fact that this government is now considering letting Australians regulate these banks and make all the rules themselves.

“There will be no protections left for New Zealanders if we do not stop this trend of Australian owned banks making their own rules,” said Mr Peters.
