United Future MP Advocates Lawbreaking

United Future MP Advocates Lawbreaking

United Future MP Bernie Ogilvy is advocating lawbreaking in suggesting that Boards of Trustees should be commended, not censured, for giving some principals extra money or perks without going through the legal processes, says New Zealand First MP, Brian Donnelly.

“Mr Ogilvy fails to understand that boards can make supplements to principals’ packages but only with the approval of the Ministry of Education. These schools in question picked up by the Auditor-General have thumbed their noses at the law.

“The reality is that most of the approved supplements to principals’ salary packages have been for their work in recruiting fee-paying foreign students. It has nothing to do with better outcomes for New Zealand students.

“The money that has been illegally paid out would otherwise have been available for students’ learning. And Mr Ogilvy believes that this should be encouraged!

“Mr Ogilvy either does not understand the situation or he has a very warped view of what is right,” said Mr Donnelly.
