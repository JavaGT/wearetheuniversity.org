Disruptive Behaviour Initiative Dependent On Streamlined Admin Process

New Zealand First education spokesperson Brian Donnelly has warned that the Interim Response Fund policy, announced today by Education Minister Steve Maharey to deal with disruptive students, will be doomed to failure if cumbersome bureaucratic processes get in the way.

“Schools will be required to apply for the funding in writing, develop an intervention plan and report on student outcomes. Any delays in these processes created by paper shuffling will mean the scheme will fail,” said Mr Donnelly.

“The fact that schools can only apply for access to the additional resources offered once they have exhausted their existing resources will put pressure on rapid access to the Interim Response Fund. The students involved will often present a danger to other students and any delays may mean they have had to be removed from the system before the resource becomes operative.

"The Interim Response Fund is a constructive initiative and should have positive outcomes. It cannot be allowed to fail because of the paper pushers in the Ministry,” said Mr Donnelly.
