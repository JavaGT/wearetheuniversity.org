**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

New Zealand First MP Fletcher Tabuteau is pleased to be confirmed today as the party’s candidate for the Rotorua electorate.

Speaking at the Rotorua AGM for New Zealand First, Mr Tabuteau said this is an election that is incredibly important for the people of Rotorua.

“The founding principles of New Zealand First are paramount in the current environment we are in right now. They are firmly grounded in a pragmatic and common-sense representation of New Zealand’s interests in Parliament, reflecting the interests of all New Zealanders because we believe in putting New Zealand, and New Zealanders, first,” Fletcher Tabuteau said.

“I want to continue my efforts to support all businesses at whatever stage of their development, to grow and thrive, thereby creating more jobs, and see large infrastructure projects happen, especially here in our city.”

“Already a list MP based in Rotorua, I am immensely proud of what has been achieved just for Rotorua in the last few years – the establishment of Te Uru Rākau, and significant investment in the Rotorua Museum, Whakarewarewa Forest, and lakefront developments, to name a few.

“I pledge to reinvigorate the economy to create jobs, jobs, jobs. This means support for local businesses, workers and local projects. Money has been unlocked already, and there will be housing, roading and big infrastructure projects coming to Rotorua ensuring employment and opportunity. I know this can be achieved because we have already done so much.
