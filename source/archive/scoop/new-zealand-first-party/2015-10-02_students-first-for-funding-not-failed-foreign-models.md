**Students first for funding, not failed foreign models**

New Zealand First believes in a funding model for education that is equity based on student needs not test scores,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

"This government continues to take New Zealand public education down a backward path by importing failed overseas funding models.

“All education funding should be focussed on children not on abstract percentage pass rates.

"New Zealand First would work with the sector to immediately review the cost of delivering our world class New Zealand Curriculum.

“That is why we have a policy on early identification and better use of school entry data to support each young New Zealander to achieve their personal best as they move through school.”
