Student Loan Policy Just More Copycat Behaviour

Student Loan Policy Just More Copycat Behaviour

The Labour Party’s new policy on student loans is just copycat behaviour that National has also been prone to, says New Zealand First.

“We are delighted that other parties see New Zealanders will benefit from our well thought through policy – but we would like some acknowledgement,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“However, while Labour is only offering to wipe a chunk of a loan if graduates fill public service jobs in the regions, New Zealand First would write-off student loans in areas where there are critical regional shortages.

“Graduates spending five years in such a programme would have their student loan written off.

“That would mean many will be settled and will stay there.”
