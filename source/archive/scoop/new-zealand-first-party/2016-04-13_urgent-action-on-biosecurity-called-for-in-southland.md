Urgent Action on Biosecurity Called for in Southland

New Zealand First is calling for urgent action on the weed velvetleaf, and questions whether the National Government is placing enough emphasis on biosecurity in Southland.

“Under the watch of Minister for Primary Industries Nathan Guy, discoveries of the invasive weed velvetleaf have climbed,” says New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill Ria Bond.

“While Environment Southland is treating velvetleaf as a serious threat Mr Guy is silent. Southland farmers deserve better,” says Ms Bond.

New Zealand First Spokesperson for Primary Industries Richard Prosser says the Ministry has known about velvetleaf in Waikato for some time.

“No-one is blaming MPI staff for not being able to achieve the necessary results when they plainly don’t have the necessary resourcing.

“It comes back to the government which must take biosecurity seriously and give it serious funding. This is urgent – every biosecurity failure that isn’t foot and mouth brings the one that is foot and mouth one failure closer.”

“New Zealand First will continue to work hard and hold the Minister to account. He needs to back Southland farmers with meaningful action,” says Ms Bond.
