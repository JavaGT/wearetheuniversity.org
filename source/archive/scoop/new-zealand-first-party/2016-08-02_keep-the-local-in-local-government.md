Keep the ‘Local’ in Local Government

New Zealand First is calling on the government to support local mayors and councils and back away from the Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill (No 2) which would thoroughly impede local decision making powers.

“New Zealand First believes in keeping the ‘local’ in ‘local government’”, says New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill, Ria Bond.

“This bill is an assault on local democracy and New Zealand First stands in support of Invercargill mayor Tim Shadbolt and the many other local mayors and councils who oppose this government power grab.

“The lack of consultation offered by this government once again shows their contempt for local representation.

“We’ve seen with the removal of elected members on the Southern DHB and Environment Canterbury that this government would like to shift more and more power to central government, away from the people it directly affects.

“Local communities should have the power to make local decisions”, says Bond.
