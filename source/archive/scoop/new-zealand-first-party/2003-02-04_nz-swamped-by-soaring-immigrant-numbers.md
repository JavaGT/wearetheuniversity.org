NZ Swamped By Soaring Immigrant Numbers

NZ Swamped By Soaring Immigrant Numbers

New Zealand First says immigration figures released today show there was an explosion in the number of migrants arriving here on a permanent basis last year.

The figures showed a net increase of 38,200 in permanent and long term arrivals compared to 9,700 the previous year – an increase of 400 percent.

Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said 42,100 New Zealanders left the country while 70,500 foreigners arrived and he claimed this was the real immigration figure for the year.

“This is almost as many as Australia, which is a ridiculous level for a country the size of New Zealand.”

Mr Peters said that New Zealand could not sustain such high levels of immigration and parts of the country, particularly Auckland were suffering from serious infrastructure problems.

“This year we are nearly 400 secondary teachers short, mainly due to increased immigration and demands from the foreign student education industry.

“House prices in Auckland have soared, the health system is buckling and interest rates have been kept high because of the economic pressures of uncontrolled immigration.”

“It proves that the Government has a crude policy of repopulating New Zealand. In many cases we are losing talented young Kiwis and replacing them with people who will contribute little to this country.

“It is time to stop this invasion before it is too late,” said Mr Peters. “The future of New Zealand is at stake.”
