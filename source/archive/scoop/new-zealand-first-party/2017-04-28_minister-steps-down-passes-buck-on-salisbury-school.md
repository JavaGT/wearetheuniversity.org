**MINISTER STEPS DOWN, PASSES BUCK ON SALISBURY SCHOOL**

Outgoing Minister of Education Hekia Parata has shown the government doesn’t care about Salisbury School, says New Zealand First.

“If National cared a clear decision would have been made on the future of the girls’ school instead of Minister Parata passing the buck to the new Minister,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Tracey Martin.

“Salisbury School has been told it can stay open until the end of 2017 and its future is in the hands of new Education Minister Nikki Kaye.

“This leaves the students, families and staff at the school in Richmond, Nelson, in limbo yet again.

“The girls at Salisbury deserve better.

“They are the very students who need consistency and stability and another ‘deferred decision’ is just not good enough.

“The new Minister needs to implement the ‘Salisbury Solution’ immediately,” says Mrs Martin.

**What is the “Salisbury Solution”**

A specialist residential education facility solely for the education and care of young people with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability and requests that:

• The MOE agrees Salisbury can re-establish its own Enrolment Committee and process as a self-governing school with an elected parental Board of Trustees.

• That the MOE supports Salisbury’s enhanced focus as a specialist residential education facility for students with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and ID (intellectual disability).

• The MOE supports Salisbury’s new direction by continuing to fund a notional roll of no less than 30 students.
