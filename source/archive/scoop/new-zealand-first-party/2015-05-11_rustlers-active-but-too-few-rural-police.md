Rustlers Active But Too Few Rural Police

  
Cuts to police numbers in rural areas is failing farmers and lifestyle block owners who are victims of rustlers, says New Zealand First.

“The latest incident in which a Canterbury farmer lost 175 sheep worth about $19,000 is a real kick in the teeth,” says Primary Industries Spokesperson Richard Prosser.

“This is a major incident. Police should be thrown at this and the offenders hauled before the court.

“National has run down policing in rural areas and there are no significant consequences even if the offender is caught. We are drafting amendments to crime and sentencing laws to bring in stronger penalties and mandatory confiscation of vehicles and equipment.

“It is sad that there are Kiwis who will cause such hardship to a farmer. Farmers are finding it tough, especially in Canterbury where paddocks are grey from the drought.

“More police and tougher penalties are overdue,” says Mr Prosser.
