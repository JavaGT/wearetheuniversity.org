Government Ignores Gagged Scientists Pleas

New Zealand First Research, Science and Technology Spokesperson Darroch Ball says the government is neglecting New Zealand scientists who say they are being gagged against speaking out on important issues by fear of losing their funding.

A survey has shown that around half of all university and Crown institute scientists in New Zealand feel they must remain silent because of the contracts their employers have with outsiders.

“This stems from the pressure to keep funding contracts, so controversial or sensitive information is kept private,” says Mr Ball.

“This has occurred directly because of the low amount of funding the government has invested in R & D in New Zealand institutions. New Zealand only invests about half of what other countries do into research and development.

“New Zealand First believes in direct investment for R & D work, which will alleviate the pressure put on universities and institutions.

”We must not ignore the pleas from scientists otherwise we will continue to lose them overseas

“It is typical of this National Government to disregard the people who are voicing concern as Mr Joyce has done today. Scientists deserve better. They should be able to expect their expert voices to be heard.”
