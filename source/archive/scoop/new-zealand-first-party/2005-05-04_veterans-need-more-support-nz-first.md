Veterans Need More Support – NZ First

New Zealand First veterans’ affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon says the Government needs to take better care of war veterans’ health needs.

This follows reports that the Government will not be funding a $2 million shortfall for a new war veterans hospital in Dunedin, placing veterans’ home and hospital services for Otago and Southland in jeopardy.

“The Government needs to reassess its priorities and efforts in taking care of our war veterans,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“It must accept the nation has a special obligation to our veterans, particularly if they have suffered as a result of their service.

“We must do all we can to provide them with better living conditions, improved health care services and a higher pension than they currently receive.

“It is the very least we can do for the men and women who made great sacrifices and put their lives on the line for the sake of this country,” concluded Mr Gudgeon.
