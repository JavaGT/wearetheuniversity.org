Put Meth ‘Cooks’ on Bad Tenant Register to Warn Landlords

**Put Meth ‘Cooks’ on Bad Tenant Register to Warn Landlords**

The government is failing to step up and address the effects of methamphetamine use and manufacture on New Zealand private rental properties, says New Zealand First.

“Tens-of-thousands of dollars are being forked out by landlords monthly having to clean up meth-contaminated properties because of the criminal behaviour of tenants, and something needs to be done urgently,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Social Housing Darroch Ball.

“New Zealand First wants all tenants found to have contaminated properties to remain on a public register for seven years so any future landlords will know who these people are and what they do to other people’s property.

“It would be up to future landlords at that stage to decide if they wish to offer them any tenancy.

“We must stop tenants who have caused methamphetamine damage moving freely from property to property causing thousands of dollars of damage along the way.

“At the moment there are no barriers to stop the ongoing impact of their actions.

“We must put a stop to the epidemic of meth damage to rental accommodation across the country.

“If we don’t take immediate action we will be faced with nothing short of another ‘leaky home’ crisis,” says Mr Ball.
