Youth Trained For Australia? Asks Peters

**Youth Trained For Australia? Asks Peters**

New Zealand First has asked the government if it is going to train young people to work in Australia as jobs in New Zealand are disappearing weekly.

Rt. Hon Winston Peters says everyone supports the idea of training teenagers because there is a huge unemployment problem but suspects the prime minister’s announcement yesterday is more about the election than the jobless.

“It’s all very well to perform in front of a National party audience but it’s quite another task to produce jobs for the young people. For soaring unemployment and teen pregnancies this was another crude dog whistle.

After over eleven years, nine in opposition, National now has half a plan for sky rocketing out of work youth.

“Thousands of jobs have disappeared since the Budget when the government fraudulently claimed that another 171,000 jobs would be created over the next four years.

“It appears the only choice that many young people will have now will be to train here, then join the hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders already working in Australia.

“’The government should be dealing with the overall effects of its policies on employment as well as training youth,” said Mr. Peters.
