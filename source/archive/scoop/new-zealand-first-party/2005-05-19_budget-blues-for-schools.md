Budget Blues for Schools

  
New Zealand First says that the Budget would be seen by secondary, area and middle schools as a real disappointment, and is calling for an urgent review of the funding formula.

“Once again, the Government continues to adjust school operational funding instead of re-examining the total basis for the operational formula,” said associate education spokesperson Jim Peters.

“No school will be persuaded by a ‘nominal increase’, which is in fact nothing more than tinkering to make it look as if something is happening.

“Principals and boards deserve better as they struggle with their present inadequate operational funding to meet the needs of the specialised schools of 2005 and beyond.

“A review of the formula is urgently needed, as was done in 1988/89.

“Minor adjustments and short-funded programmes are of little value for the students of today and the future,” said Mr Peters.
