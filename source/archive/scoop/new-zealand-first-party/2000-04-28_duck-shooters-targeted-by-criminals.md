Duck Shooters Targeted By Criminals
===================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Thoughtless duck shooting regulations are helping gun thieves gain information about the location of shot guns, said New Zealand First Law and Order spokesman, Ron Mark.

The duck shooting season starts next week and hunters have been preparing their maimais for opening day.

“These hunters are required by law to put their names and addresses on the maimais they have reserved.

“Last night a Waikato hunter returned home to find his gun safe broken open and two shot guns stolen.

“The name and address tag had been taken from this hunter’s maimai. It appears that this law is in effect giving criminals information about the location of shotguns, which can then be used for committing crimes, “said Mr Mark.

He said that he will seek a change in the regulations, but in the meantime he urged hunters to take extra precautions to secure their weapons this season.

  
Ends.
