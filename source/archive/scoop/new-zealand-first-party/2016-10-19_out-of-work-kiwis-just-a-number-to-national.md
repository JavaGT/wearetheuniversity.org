Out of Work Kiwis Just a Number to National

Young New Zealanders have no hope of getting their first job against an avalanche of thousands of low-skilled immigrants desperate for work, says New Zealand First Deputy Leader Ron Mark.

“There are 75,000 young Kiwis without work and not learning skills – but under National they are just numbers.

“In Parliament today Minister of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce had no concerns for their future, instead he boasted that they represented the lowest number since these statistics began.

“But none of these young Kiwis answer to a number, they are individuals who are missing out while immigrants snap up jobs in supermarkets, service stations and hospitality, often accepting poor pay and work conditions.

“In March, Minister of Immigration Michael Woodhouse claimed he was working closely with other Ministers to ‘ensure that Kiwis are at the front of the queue and that immigration policy is at the end of the pipeline’. However, Kiwis are still at the back of the queue.

“The Salvation Army released a report today that supports New Zealand First’s stance on turning the tap down on immigration, particularly low-skilled migrants.

“So what is Mr Woodhouse’s view of the Salvation Army, given he has labelled New Zealand First xenophobic for having such views?”
