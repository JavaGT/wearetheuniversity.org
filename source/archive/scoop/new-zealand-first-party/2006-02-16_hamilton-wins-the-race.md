Hamilton Wins The Race

New Zealand First congratulates Hamilton City on securing the V8 Supercar event, and says it will bring huge benefits to the city both financially and in terms of raising the profile of the city and the Waikato region.

“Mayor Michael Redman and his council have beaten out some major contenders to host this race, and that’s great news for Hamilton,” said Hamilton-based list MP Doug Woolerton.

“They have convinced Avesco of the merits of holding the event in Hamilton for eight years by highlighting the wonderful amenities available, and by minimising red tape to make Hamilton the most attractive option.

“That deserves commendation, and I am sure the people of Hamilton will show their appreciation by getting involved in the spirit and fun of the event. I support it wholeheartedly, and will enjoy every minute of it,” said Mr Woolerton.
