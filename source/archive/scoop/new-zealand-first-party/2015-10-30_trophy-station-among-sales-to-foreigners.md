‘Trophy’ Station Among Sales to Foreigners

**‘Trophy’ Station Among Sales to Foreigners**

A Canterbury “trophy” high country station, a dairy farm, a sheep and beef property, kiwifruit land and a horse/racing facility have all fallen into foreign hands in the past month, says New Zealand First.

“While Prime Minister John Key argues National has sold less land to foreigners than the previous government, and claims there are tougher criteria, sales are still being ticked off at an alarming rate by the Overseas Investment Office,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Big Ben Station, extending over 3418 hectares, an iconic station in the Rakaia Gorge, has been sold for $12.5 million to Hawaiian interests. The Americans already own three neighbouring farms, including Coleridge Downs which they bought in 1994.

“The Prime Minister might want to explain what the benefits are of a New Zealand owned 280-hectare Canterbury dairy farm being sold to the Canadian government’s pension fund. This is simply a transfer of wealth to an investment fund which has no interest in preserving the quality of our land for future generations of Kiwis.

“Kiwis are the top of the expertise chain when it comes to dairying, not pension funds, so why on earth is local ownership of our land and expertise not valued?

“Mr Key might also like to explain the sale of 492 hectares of Central Hawkes Bay land to American interests who ‘intend to immigrate and reside in New Zealand indefinitely’. What contribution will they make to the economy on this sheep and beef finishing farm, when, again, farming is what we do so well.

“This type of foreign ownership is not going to take New Zealand forward, and essentially just pushes up the price of land for aspiring Kiwi farmers.

“Mr Key says ‘it is about striking the appropriate balance’ but there has been no balance shown by this government. New Zealand First wants to protect our land and housing and says sales should be restricted to proven residency only.”
