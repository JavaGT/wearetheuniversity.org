‘**The Budget- a Country up For Sale’**  
   
The Budget this week revealed the true mentality of the individuals who now lead the National Party.  
   
In their first term of office they handed out huge tax cuts to the very rich.  
   
Remember the boss of the Westpac bank got nearly six thousand dollars a week extra in his take home pay.  
   
And people at the bottom of the heap got to pay higher GST on everything like their food, petrol and power bills.  
   
The country could not afford those tax cuts – it is going further into debt because of them so what do these financial wizards come up with?  
   
They’re going to ignore the profits of the very rich – the overseas banks and the rip off merchants that exploit New Zealand.  
   
And they are going to go after the children, the paper boys, the pamphlet deliverers, the kids who wash cars.  
   
Apparently these paper boys are the real tax dodgers bleeding our economy dry.  
   
In all my years in politics I never thought I would see the day when the nation’s children would be targeted for their pocket money by a minister of finance.  
   
Remember a few short years ago when it was revealed he had taken tens and tens of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money for living in his own house in Wellington!  
   
Some people appear to have forgotten that Mr English is the biggest housing beneficiary of all time in New Zealand.  
   
He talks about fiscal prudence – but that’s for other people.   
   
Those at the bottom of the heap have to be fiscally prudent.  
   
They have no choice.  
   
The Budget was also unkind to the elderly.  
   
It is only a matter of time before pensions are “adjusted”.  
   
The National Party’s cheerleaders, behind the scenes, have mounted a big campaign to get the pension age increased and the amount reduced.  
   
Hidden in the Budget and unannounced was a change to the asset testing when a pensioner goes into residential care.  
   
It is a punishment dished out to those who save for their retirement and own their own home.  
   
More and more pensioner homes will be sold to pay for residential care.  
   
And this is being done to people who have worked hard and paid their taxes all their lives.

The Budget did nothing for the Northland region either.  
   
You have heard it all before.  
   
About nine percent of the workforce up here in the North is unemployed – that’s according to official figures.

We all know that it’s much higher.  
   
It is a sad fact that Northland levels of poverty and health issues are the worst in the country.

A third of the children in the lower decile schools in Whangarei receive weekly food assistance.

In some cases they have to get extra food more than once a week.  
   
Just this week 600 people from this area signed up, at a meeting in this town Kaikohe, to look for work in Western Australia.  
   
What does that tell you?  
   
It tells us there are plenty of people here who want to work but there are not enough jobs.  
   
It also tells us New Zealand is being asset stripped of our greatest resource – our people.  
   
Teams of Australian recruitment agencies are travelling throughout New Zealand to pick up people willing to travel to the “Lucky Country”

We are losing people to Australia at a rate of over a thousand a week.

And what does Prime Minister John Key say?

Well, he says no worries.

He says “there should be no cause to worry about New Zealanders going to work in the Australian mining boom.

Australia contributed to 40 per cent of the economy and New Zealand wanted a strong Australia.”

How is that for dismissive callousness?

Mr Key was speaking to the TransTasman Business Circle in Auckland – some of these people have a vested interest in sucking New Zealand dry of resources and people.

And wait for this one – when he let slip the government’s real agenda.

He also said that if you were shopping for countries, New Zealand would be a good prospect.

He bragged - "If you were really going to go out and buy a country, why wouldn't you want to buy New Zealand?

So there you have it.

An admission of what many of you have suspected.  
   
The leader of this country is out there selling New Zealand.  
   
It’s not enough to sell our power stations and our airline.  
   
Everything is going under the auctioneer’s hammer.  
   
To him this country, its resources, its people are just there to be traded like everything else he’s laid his eyes on.  
   
The leadership of this country has a mindset that is quite frightening.  
   
They have no patriotism – no love of their native land.  
   
They are mercenaries, ready to sell even if it is not for the highest price.  
   
Their idealism is buried in the ashes of the first deal they made.  
   
This nation was built by hard work and sacrifice.  
   
The speculators and wheeler dealers who arrogantly stalk the halls of power are interested only in exploiting our resources and enslaving the workers.  
   
It has become clear what is happening.  
   
It’s time for some blunt speaking about the government’s policies of exporting our professional people, our tradespeople, our skilled, our keen and enthusiastic people.  
   
The government is deliberately driving out of the country the middle class and trades backbone and anyone with the ability or courage to stand up against them.  
   
They don’t want people with steel up their backbone, they don’t want the traditionalists, the patriots, the staunch and the stable.  
   
They actually want to get rid of whole sections of the population.  
   
They want to replace them with subservient immigrants willing to work for slave wages because anything is better than where they come from.  
   
This fits in with their aim of a low wage, high price, economy.  
   
Just think about it.  
   
Over one thousand people leaving every week, leaving to look for a better life for their families.  
   
We are exporting many of our best and what are we getting in return?  
   
Immigration.  
   
What sort of immigration?  
   
In too many cases people without the skills of those departing.  
   
In too many cases people who come here for what they can get.  
   
Who can blame them but that does not form the basis of a sound and wise immigration policy.  
   
In too many cases people who come here and then bring a team of relations – especially older people who eventually get a New Zealand pension without ever contributing anything.  
   
In too many cases people who come from an alien culture, often complete with all their hang ups and prejudices and expecting us to conform!  
   
New Zealand has a reputation as a “sucker” nation.  
   
And the National Party’s latest threats to the pensioners of this country gives the lie to the wisdom of our Immigration Policies for the last 25 years.  
   
Part of the reason for this wholesale Immigration Policy was to ward off the effects of an aging population.  
   
It has done no such thing.  
   
In many cases it has added to the aging population.  
   
Over the years New Zealand First has had boxes and boxes of immigration scams.  
   
We could not keep up with them. And when we tried to do something about it many of the cases would disappear down a black hole.  
   
In my lifetime I have seen this country go from being one of the best places in the world to work and bring up a family to one of the worst.  
   
Deliberate government policies have created this low wage –high price economy.  
   
New Zealand wages are low.  
   
The cost of living is soaring.  
   
This winter the price of power is jumping at least ten per cent.  
   
Petrol prices are up and so is just about everything else.  
   
Northland has been seriously hurt by the policies of successive governments.  
   
I know about this area – I grew up here.  
   
When we were young we lived in a province full of energy and hope.  
   
There was a future for us at home.  
   
The future now lies across the Tasman.  
   
Australia is bleeding us dry.  
   
We raised our young people.  
   
We educated them. We trained them.  
   
We prepared them to work in New Zealand to keep building a then great country.  
   
Now they are pouring across the Tasman to work in Australia.  
   
It is a sad fact of life that the Australian government is creating more jobs for New Zealanders than the New Zealand government.  
   
This is an indictment on the leadership of this country.  
   
They are globalists – they don’t care about this country.  
   
It’s just a heap of resources to be plundered.  
   
Do not think for one moment that they care about our children and grandchildren going to live in another country.  
   
What about the grandparents?  
   
What about the family back home?  
   
New Zealand will end up as an economically and socially distorted society, made up of senior citizens reliant on new immigrants.  
   
That is the brighter future John Key promised you at the last election.  
   
For three years his government pretended to be reasonable – behind the smiley face.  
   
Now it is clear.  
   
The smiley face is a wolf in wolf’s clothing.  
   
Nothing is sacred.  
   
All of this Finance Minister Bill English describes as a “series of moderate and considered adjustments.

Everything is up for sale by this money trader and his big financial backers.  
   
We say enough is enough.  
   
The Key government did not get a mandate to chop up New Zealand and sell it.  
   
Make your voices heard.  
   
Hammer your local MP’s.  
   
Bomb the Beehive with your message that you want jobs and hope.  
   
That you want your families to live in New Zealand.  
   
And that you want to own your own country.   
   
And you want it back NOW!!!!  
   
And that on these critical issues: to you, to your family, to your towns and cities, and to your country, you will never ever back down.
