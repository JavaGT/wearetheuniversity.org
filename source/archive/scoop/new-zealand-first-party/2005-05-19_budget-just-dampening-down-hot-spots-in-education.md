Budget Just Dampening Down Hot Spots In Education

“Budget announcements on education do nothing more than dampen down some hot spots,” said New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“There is some extra money thrown at school operational grants when what is needed is a thorough review of the costs of expectations of schools.

“There is a little bit extra for Special Education when what is needed is an expansion for the 1% allocation for ORRS funding and dramatic increase in Special Education Grant money.

“There is some tinkering with Tertiary student support but little of significance. Students will be looking towards increased fees so any gains will be quickly retrieved.

“What is absolutely certain is that the hot spots that have been dampened will soon burst into flame but the government is hoping this won’t be until after the election,” said Mr Donnelly.
