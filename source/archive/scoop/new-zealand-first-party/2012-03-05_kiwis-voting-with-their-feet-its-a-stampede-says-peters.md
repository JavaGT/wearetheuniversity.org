Kiwis voting with their feet – It’s a stampede, says Peters

Kiwis are voting with their feet, telling John Key’s government that they don’t like the direction the country is heading, says New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters.

According to Statistics New Zealand, 4,700 more New Zealanders left for Australia than arrived in January, taking the annual loss to a record 38,100 in the 12 month-period, the highest level since August 2001.

“This is further proof that National doesn’t have a plan to get New Zealanders a more prosperous future apart from a taxi to the nearest international airport.

“There is no plan for economic growth or job growth. We are losing talented people overseas at an increasing rate to get jobs and experience that just aren’t available in New Zealand under this government.

“It’s understandable that people from Canterbury are leaving for overseas, but that’s just a small proportion of the mass exodus of people leaving this country.

“This government is driving New Zealanders out of their own country with its short-sighted economic policies of selling state assets, slashing jobs and hoping something will turn up.

“National’s promise of equal opportunity with Australia is a sick joke. The only way Kiwis are matching Australian wages is by going across the Tasman,” says Mr Peters.
