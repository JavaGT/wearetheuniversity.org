Licence Case Demands Tougher Stand by National

Licence Case Demands Tougher Stand by National

The case of five foreign nationals allegedly using borrowed licences to drive tourist buses requires tough action from the Minister of Transport, says New Zealand First Transport Spokesperson, Denis O’Rourke.

“New Zealanders will be shocked this is happening on our roads with lives being endangered by this reckless disregard for our laws.

“These Chinese men drove buses and vans for Alps Travel at the height of the tourist season on roads which are dangerous at the best of times, let alone when thousands more vehicles are on them.

“If the judge finds the men guilty then the minister must either cancel the company’s transport services licence or suspend the licence until a full review is completed, because it is such a gross breach.

“The government is letting down the New Zealand public and must take a more vigorous stand to ensure foreign nationals who drive in New Zealand meet our standards.

“This case should also be a lesson to all transport companies in New Zealand,” Mr O’Rourke says.
