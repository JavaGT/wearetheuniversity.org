Poverty ‘Greets’ Many Immigrant Children

Spokesperson for Ethnic Affairs

**Poverty ‘Greets’ Many Immigrant Children**

Many Asian and Indian children immigrate to New Zealand only to end up living in poverty, says New Zealand First.

“New Zealand has not delivered a better life for these youngsters and their families,” says Spokesperson on Ethnic Affairs Mahesh Bindra. “Instead, many children suffer health problems through living in overcrowded houses.”

The government should be ashamed and embarrassed that it is encouraging immigration when many people find themselves in wretched conditions in a country that was supposed to be full of opportunity, says Mr Bindra.

“The Child Poverty Monitor report has found that 21 per cent of Asian and Indian children live in overcrowded homes. This is totally unacceptable.

“Some ethnic families might have lived in overcrowded conditions before they arrived, but this is not what life in New Zealand should be. It saddens me.

“The government says a stronger economy will make child poverty disappear – we have been waiting six years but there has been no vast improvement for hundreds and thousands of new Kiwi kids,” says Mr Bindra.
