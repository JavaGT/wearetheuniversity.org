Kick Out The Illegals Please Minister

Kick Out The Illegals Please Minister

New Zealand First has called on the Government to explain why it has not deported 1,759 illegal asylum seekers still in the country.

Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said today that it was disgraceful that hundreds of illegal aliens were wandering the country at will - probably still receiving state paid benefits.

“The Immigration Minister has some explaining to do. If all the overstayers are added to the total, we have thousands of people in the country who have no right to be here.

“They should be deported immediately, or placed in secure detention areas until arrangements are made to get them out of here.”

Mr Peters said that he had dealt with genuine cases of people who were qualified to be good citizens but they were kicked out because of unfocused immigration rules.

“However, If they had called themselves Ying Tong, Mushtaq or Mohammed, destroyed their passports and claimed to be refugees or asylum-seekers, they would be made welcome, given benefits, medical care and other state-funded care.

“Our immigration system is stupid and dysfunctional. It is long past time for a clean-up and some rational policies,” said Mr Peters.
