Mark Calls For Byers To Resign

Inquiries and apologies are not enough to correct the failures of the Corrections Department, says New Zealand First’s Ron Mark.

“It is time for Mark Byers to accept that his lack of responsible leadership has put the community at risk. It is time for Mark Byers to resign.”

Last week Mr Mark called for an inquiry into management of Canterbury prisons. He is pleased that Mr Byers has admitted that he is ultimately accountable for two recent prison escapes, but said that is not enough.

“For some considerable time, Mr Byers has displayed an arrogance in Select Committees and total indifference to concerns raised by Members of Parliament as to his department’s performance,” said Mr Mark.

“In the south, a dangerous convict escaped by hiding in a truck while in the north, the budget for Ngawha prison has skyrocketed by another $20million and building work hasn’t even started yet.

“At Rimutaka, a prisoner escaped by driving a vehicle he had the keys for and at Christchurch, repercussions over the illegal and bizarre activities of the ‘Goon Squad’ continues to plague the Employment Court.

“When a Christchurch inmate died in his cell of a drug overdose, having been escorted by prison staff to the residence of a known drug user, I didn’t think Corrections could get any worse. Clearly, they have and on that basis, I believe it is time Mr Byers resigned or was sacked,” said Mr Mark.
