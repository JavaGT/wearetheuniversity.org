Auckland Regional Transport A Priority

New Zealand First supports the call by Manukau City Mayor Sir Barry Curtis for an urgent meeting of Auckland councils concerning regional transport.

“New Zealand First strongly supported the Local Government (Auckland) Amendment Bill this year, and particularly supported the role the Act gave to the Auckland Regional Land Transport Strategy,” said local government spokesperson Jim Peters.

“Regional land transport committees have a new statutory function in 2005 and all elected councillors within the region ought to be aware of the need for not only their council roading, but also the overall demand from ratepayers for integrated transport systems.

“Transit and Transfund will be far better able to be effective implementation agencies, and taxpayers will have effective value from Government funding, when all Auckland councils co-operate in the region.

“The development of Auckland’s transport is not just an Auckland matter. It affects Northland and the Waikato region as well,” said Mr Peters.
