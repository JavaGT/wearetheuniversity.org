Iconic Māori College Still Needed

  
New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin says the government should do more to collaborate with the Catholic church in saving Hato Petera Māori College.

“The government can and should do more to keep this iconic school from closing down,” says Ms Martin.

“Poor hostel facilities for Hato Petera boarding students have contributed to falling numbers at the school, now below 100 pupils. Maintenance and management of the facilities need improving and this is something the Ministry of Education should address in concert with the New Zealand Catholic Education Office.

“Boarding remains in demand and if the government can come to the rescue of former private schools like Wanganui Collegiate, then it should and must do the same here.

“The InZone projects at Epsom Girls Grammar and Auckland Boys Grammar are further examples that boarding works for the students who need it. New Zealand First believes there is still a place for boarding schools and these facilities open opportunities especially for rural and isolated students. They are vital for some students, providing a stable and secure learning environment.

“Hato Petera has educated hundreds of students and has produced a number of notable New Zealanders. The school has put into practice ‘Māori achieving success as Māori’.

“It would be a great shame if the government and Catholic church gave up on it, especially as it’s likely to be under pressure from developers snapping at its heels to get hold of the valuable land the school occupies,” says Ms Martin.
