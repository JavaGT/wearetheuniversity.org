Kiwis Losing Their Sight – Coleman Must Clear Backlog at DHB

Kiwis Losing Their Sight – Coleman Must Clear Backlog at DHB

Health Minister Jonathan Coleman must provide immediate funding to clear the Southern DHB’s ophthalmology backlog and in other DHBs, says New Zealand First.

“Because of delays at the Southern District Health Board, 30 patients suffered partial sight loss in 2015-16 and thousands of other patients needing treatment have been told to wait,” says Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“It’s a disgrace. Kiwis are losing their sight through massive delays in getting treatment.

“This is just one DHB and it is could be the same at other DHBs.

“New Zealanders who have paid taxes all their lives and expect to receive health care when they need it are being forced to sit and hope they can get treatment while their precious sight fades away.

“This is unacceptable. The government has underfunded health, told DHBs to cost cut and put excessive pressure on health services by out of control immigration.

“Record levels of immigration and record population growth have consequences which the government will not accept and take responsibility for.”
