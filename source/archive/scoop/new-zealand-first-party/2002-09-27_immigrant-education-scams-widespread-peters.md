Immigrant Education Scams Widespread - Peters

“Welcome to the real world of immigration scams Trevor Mallard,” said New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters today in response to the Government’s belated move to shut immigrant education loopholes.

Mr Peters said that while Labour and National were sleeping, thousands of migrants achieved residence to educate their children at the expense of New Zealand taxpayers and then went home again.

“Just about everybody in New Zealand except the Government knows that this is happening but the politicians sat on their hands and did nothing about it,” he said.

Mr Peters pointed out that these people also received other benefits such as health services, and contributed little or nothing by way of taxes paid.

“New Zealanders have been ripped off to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by these immigrants who come only to plunder and to leave nothing in return.

“The Government should also be investigating all the other cases of immigration fraud that are sitting on officials’ desks,” said Mr Peters.
