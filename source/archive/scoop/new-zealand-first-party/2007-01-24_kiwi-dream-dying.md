Kiwi Dream Dying

New Zealand First is alarmed at the relentless decline in housing affordability, and is calling on the Government to urgently address this problem which is fundamentally altering our social fabric.

“The Kiwi goal of home ownership is simply unattainable to many young people who are already leaving university with major debt, and to those on low incomes, many of whom are Maori,” said Housing spokesperson Pita Paraone.

“The crippling cost of getting into a home in any of our major or minor cities puts any ideas of home ownership right out of contention, which leaves too many New Zealanders feeling dejected and alienated.

“The reasons why we are turning into a nation of renters rather than home owners are varied, and include foreign and local investment in property pushing up prices, low wages, immigration, lack of land being made available, interest rates etc, but I think we need to seriously and urgently ask if we want this shift to be taking place.

“New Zealand First is adamant that we don’t. Home ownership gives people a stake in their communities, and creates social stability. Do we really need to jeopardise this by letting house prices skyrocket out of control, making landlords wealthy but renters unable to get ahead?

“This problem is serious, and it needs workable solutions. I urge the Government to review its current housing and related policies, which are clearly not having the desired effect,” said Mr Paraone.
