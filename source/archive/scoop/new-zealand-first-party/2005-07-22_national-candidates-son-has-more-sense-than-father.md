National Candidates Son Has More Sense Than Father

National Candidates Son Has More Sense Than Partisan Father

New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says the New Zealand Students Association co-president Andrew Kirton has far more political sense than his Father, Weston Kirton the National Party candidate for Taupo.

The NZUSA co-president criticised his Father’s party yesterday referring to National’s unconvincing past tenures in Government, which generated significant decreases in student allowance eligibility.

Kirton Junior also disapproved of the National Party’s new rebates for interest repayment on loans.

“It seems to me that the offspring of National Party candidates have more political nous when it comes to policy than their parents,” said Mr Peters.

“It makes you wonder what gets discussed around the Kirton family dinner table, and I don’t think it would be pass the salt.

“The National candidates obviously have no ability to think for themselves, following idly in the footsteps of their leader Don Brash.

“Perhaps the National party should heed the advice of their relatives, who seem to have more idea about policy and politics than their partisan elders,” concluded Mr Peters.
