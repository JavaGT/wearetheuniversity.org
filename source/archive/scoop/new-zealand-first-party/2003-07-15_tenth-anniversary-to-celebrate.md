Tenth Anniversary To Celebrate
==============================

Tenth Anniversary To Celebrate

Celebrations marking one of the most important events on the political calendar - the tenth anniversary of the founding of New Zealand First - will start in Tauranga on Friday.

Leader and Tauranga MP Rt Hon Winston Peters and a loyal team launched the party at a public meeting in Auckland on 18th July 1993.

Mr Peters says that day at Alexandra Park ten years ago led to major changes on the political landscape in New Zealand and an end to the two-party system that destroyed voters’ faith in politics.

“The Labour government of 1984-90 disemboweled New Zealand economically and National took over burying the remains. No governments in the history of New Zealand practiced such political deception.

“The only real improvement came during the time of the first MMP government when New Zealand First took initiatives that improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.”

Mr Peters said that the country was still going through troubled times with unrestrained immigration, racial tensions created by unrealistic Treaty expectations and increasing levels of serious crime.

“New Zealand First will play a major part in restoring voters confidence in the political process over the next ten years. Our time is still to come.”

The celebrations start with a function in Tauranga on Friday night and there will be further events in Wellington and Christchurch.
