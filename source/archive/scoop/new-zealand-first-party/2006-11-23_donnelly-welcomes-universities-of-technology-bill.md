Donnelly Welcomes Universities of Technology Bill

New Zealand First's education spokesperson Brian Donnelly has welcomed the introduction of his Education (Establishment of Universities of Technology) Amendment Bill to Parliament today.

The Bill amends the Education Act 1989 and seeks to establish a new category of tertiary institution, a university of technology.

"Looking at the feasibility and benefit of establishing a non-university class of institution for technology is part of New Zealand First's Confidence and Supply agreement with the Government," said Mr Donnelly.

"The primary aim of establishing a university of technology category is to establish closer links with business and industry and engagement in applied research at a tertiary level.

"Universities of technology will raise workplace skills and knowledge to meet a broad range of industry, business and community needs, and place us on a level playing field with overseas education providers.

"The Bill will allow for students to move seamlessly across various levels of tertiary education, with delivery of appropriate sub-degree programmes and pathways which allow them to progress to higher levels of education and training as and when required to pursue their career goals.

"Opening up opportunities for students to engage in research and practice in a stimulating environment that presents a variety of career opportunities will help to ensure we keep our best students and provide for research and development expertise," concluded Mr Donnelly.
