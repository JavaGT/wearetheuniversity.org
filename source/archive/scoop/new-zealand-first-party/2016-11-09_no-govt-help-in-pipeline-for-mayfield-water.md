No Govt Help in Pipeline for Mayfield Water
===========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**Richard Prosser MP**  
Spokesperson for Primary Industries

**NO GOVT HELP IN PIPELINE FOR MAYFIELD WATER**

The government today fobbed off drinking water issues in the Canterbury town of Mayfield claiming no responsibility, says Primary Industries Spokesperson and Canterbury-based List MP Richard Prosser.

“Under questions in Parliament, Minister Louise Upston, on behalf of the Local Government Minister, dismissed Mayfield’s water issues saying Ashburton District Council wouldn’t be ‘driving bottles of water out to the community there’ anytime soon.

“Mayfield residents are being treated like second-class citizens while the Minister resorts to cheap sarcasm.

“Meanwhile, the Ashburton council is reportedly reconsidering selling a property with a water consent for a take of billions of litres of artesian water. It will likely be exported as bottled water.

“Meanwhile, residents are forced to use treated water from a water race, originally intended for cows and sheep.

“It is despicable and grossly unfair.

“Any approved bottling plant should be paying a royalty, 25 per cent of which should stay in the region where the water was sourced.

“This would assist councils like Ashburton with town water supplies.”
