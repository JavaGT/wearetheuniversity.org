Another Key put-down of young New Zealanders

**ANOTHER KEY PUT-DOWN OF YOUNG NEW ZEALANDERS**

The Key government has condemned thousands of young New Zealanders to the scrapheap depicting them as useless and work-shy as their excuse for allowing mass immigration, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“We have 131,000 unemployed in New Zealand with 70,000 young people aged 15 to 24 not in work or training and they’re just being written off by the government while being bad-mouthed by some employers.

“If we allow these young people, and the generation that follows them, to fall through the cracks, our society will pay a terrible price economically and socially with increased crime and greater numbers of dysfunctional families.

“Allowing cheap, servile labour pushes aside a problem that will only get worse.

“Instead of attacking young New Zealanders, the government needs to introduce policies to assist them into acquiring good working habits and turning their lives around.

“Also, employers must ensure work conditions and wages are fair.

“Government departments recently uncovered numerous breaches in the Marlborough wine contracting industry, with nine out of 10 operators randomly assessed found to be non-compliant.

“A Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) report in 2014 found three out of four dairy farmers, most of whom employ migrant workers, were not meeting our employment law requirements.

“The days of slavery have ended – but perhaps Mr Key and some New Zealand employers need reminding of that,” says Mr Peters.
