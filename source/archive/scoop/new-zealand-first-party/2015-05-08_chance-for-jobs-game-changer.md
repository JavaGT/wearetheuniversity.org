Chance for Jobs Game Changer

Chance for Jobs Game Changer  

The blow of job losses on the West Coast could have been cushioned had mine royalties been retained on the Coast, says New Zealand First.

“Twenty-five per cent of royalties from all the mining should have been targeted for regional development and new enterprises, with decision making in the regions,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Had this occurred the Coast would have had tens of millions that could have led to job creation. A share of royalties could be a game changer for all regions with extractive industries.

“The government continues to neglect the regions which produce the bulk of exports, yet receive little in return.

“The picture is bleak with the mining jobs going, health food workers facing job losses in Dunedin, job losses in Taranaki and unemployment at 146,000. Thousands of New Zealanders are stuck in part-time or casual employment.

“National has driven the competition for jobs with open door immigration and allowing tens of thousands of foreign students to work – they are now taking over the low skilled jobs in supermarkets, service stations and in hospitality.  
“Instead, immigration should focus on skilled workers when we need them and foreign students should be paying for study and living costs with foreign dollars, not those earned in New Zealand,” says Mr Peters.
