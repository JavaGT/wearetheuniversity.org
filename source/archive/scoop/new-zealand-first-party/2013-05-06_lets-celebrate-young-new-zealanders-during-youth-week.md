Let’s Celebrate Young New Zealanders During Youth Week

New Zealand First says it’s time to accentuate the positive during Youth Week from May 4 - 12.

Youth Affairs spokesperson Tracey Martin says youth often hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons but there are plenty who are flying under the radar, quietly achieving worthwhile things.

Ms Martin says, “I’ve recently been so impressed with the young people I’ve met as part of the Youth Parliament, that I’ve asked two finalists to become youth representatives on the Rodney Local Board. I believe they’ll offer an invaluable contribution to the board providing insights from a youth perspective.

“It’s also appropriate that Youth MPs begin their tenure during Youth Week and I want to encourage them to reach out to achieve their full potential.

“Another young person I’m impressed with is Mahurangi College student Jessie Wrigglesworth, who delivered an outstanding speech to win the Business and Professional Women 2012 Warkworth Leadership Award. I’ll be showing her around parliament as part of her prize and have no doubt we’ll see her name crop up again in the future as she achieves great things.

“The theme of this year’s Youth Week is Pakiwaitaratanga – Live Like a Legend – Let’s celebrate youth with positive stories in the media, to show we value and support our young people.

“My challenge to the media this year is to set aside dedicated on-air time devoted to youth. Maori TV is already leading the charge with its search for exceptional young New Zealanders for its upcoming programme “Matariki Magic”.

“How amazing would it be to hear lots of positive stories about our young people during Youth Week?
