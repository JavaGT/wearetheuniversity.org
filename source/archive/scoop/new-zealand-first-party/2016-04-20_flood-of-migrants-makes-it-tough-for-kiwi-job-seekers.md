Flood of Migrants Makes It Tough for Kiwi Job Seekers

A quarter of a million people are coming in on temporary work and student visas each year and want a job – it’s tough luck for New Zealanders, says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Migrants, many heavily in debt, are desperate for money – they will accept any conditions with loan sharks in their home country holding their families over a barrel,” Mr Peters told the Grey Power AGM in Christchurch this evening.

“A University of Auckland study, quoted in the NZ Herald today, found one in five people temporary migrants are paid below the minimum wage or work more hours than they are paid for,” Mr Peters told the Grey Power AGM in Christchurch this evening.

“There are only 55 labour inspectors in the whole country. They cannot monitor this situation.

“It’s not the migrants’ fault. National created this circus by extending work hours for foreign students.

“The Export Education sector, instead of bringing foreign money in is actually debt-financed migration.

“The younger generation of New Zealanders now competes with immigrants in their own country,” Mr Peters said.
