Northland Only Rates a Mention, Misses Out on Big Projects

**Northland Only Rates a Mention, Misses Out on Big Projects**

Where are National’s Northland by-election promises on bridges and roading amidst today’s hoopla from the government on infrastructure spending, asks New Zealand First.

“Need we remind National, a major promise was two-laning 10 Northland bridges – so far the government has only budgeted for the two Matakohe bridges and the Taipa and Kaeo bridges,” says Northland MP and New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Given these promises were made to catch votes, and the media were called to announce the government’s magnanimity, the failure to follow through is a breach of trust.

“National has gone back to its old ways and is thumbing its nose at Northland.

“The bridges were costed at $69 million, so where did that funding go?

“It’s no matter whether everyone agreed with the need for two-laning, it’s that Northlanders should be able to have faith in the government of the day.

“Today the PM and government have made much of job creation, claiming that infrastructure projects bring tens of thousands of jobs, yet in Northland jobs are in short supply. The PM failed to announce any significant new public works but the government claimed it was doing much for the regions, and had the audacity to include Northland.

“As Columbus tripped across the Americas, so too did Mr Key and Mr Joyce discover Northland in March last year – and the rest of regional New Zealand soon after – but it appears that’s as far as it goes.

“Northland is waiting for the full set of promises – 10 two-lane bridges, superfast broadband rollout, taxpayer funded cellphone coverage and the Puhoi to Wellsford highway.”
