Anderton Hypocritical Over Student Assistance
=============================================

**Wednesday, 7 February 2001, 3:19 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

“Jim Anderton is displaying the height of hypocrisy in calling for adequate financial support over the summer holidays,” said New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Hon Brian Donnelly MP.

“Less than a year ago Jim Anderton and his Alliance team voted down legislation introduced to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students.

St Jim is now calling for something which he had the power to effect last year. He and his Alliance team turned their backs on students as they lapped up to their Labour master.

He is now acting like a small dog yapping at passers-by behind closed gates. When the gates were opened for him he ran away.”
