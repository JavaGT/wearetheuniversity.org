Underground Transpower Line Says NZ First

New Zealand First housing spokesperson Brent Catchpole says Transpower’s proposed electricity line across Waikato and South Auckland should be placed underground through residential and semi-rural areas to avoid disruption and minimise property devaluation.

Mr Catchpole’s comments follow reports that pylons built near property owners’ homes could place up to a quarter of their property’s value in jeopardy.

“Building a new line of bigger pylons through private land has the potential to destroy development. It could be a huge blow to residents and property owners in the areas affected,” said Mr Catchpole.

“If Transpower is insisting on building a new line in a semi-urban area, then the lines should be built underground to avoid disruption and minimise property devaluation.

“The other option would be to redirect the building of new pylons to less intrusive areas, like the back blocks of a farm,” concluded Mr Catchpole.
