Minister Must Back Homegrown Education
======================================

**Minister Must Back Homegrown Education**

New Zealand First is calling on the Education Minister to clearly spell out the future of the successful Te Kotahitanga education programme amid fears it will be “trashed”.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government has poured millions of dollars into this homegrown programme, which is helping to close the achievement gap between Maori, Pasifika and Pakeha students.

The rate of students achieving NCEA level 2 at Hamilton’s Melville High School has increased from 20 to 73 per cent, and level 3 achieving from zero to 35 per cent between 2008 and 2011 using Te Kotahitanga.

“The Government cries crocodile tears for Maori and Pasifika students not achieving in our current education system but is holding back programmes like Te Kotahitanga which are proven to assist ALL students to achieve their best.

“Mainstream schools across New Zealand have been requesting professional development on these programmes for years with their pleas falling on deaf ears.

“It is far better to increase the scope of these successful programmes than curb them and pour money into charter schools, which is simply privatising educational failure,” says Ms Martin.

“The Minister should front up and tell parents, teachers, students and taxpayers exactly what she plans for the future of state-funded education.”
