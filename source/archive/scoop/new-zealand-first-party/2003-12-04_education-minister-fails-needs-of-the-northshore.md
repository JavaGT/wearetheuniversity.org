Education Minister Fails Needs Of The Northshore

“The minority Labour Government is being totally irresponsible by not making immediate provision for a Senior High School in Albany to cater for year 10 to year 13 students,” said Dail Jones.

The Minister advised Mr Jones the Ministry was planning to build a new Junior High School for year levels 7 to 10 on a site in Appleby Road, Albany. The target date for this school is January 2005. Mr Jones was also advised “it is planned to subsequently open a Senior High School in Albany to cater for year 10 to 15 (sic) on a site yet to be finalized”.

“The northern part of the North Shore has one of the largest growth rates in New Zealand. The last time a new State school was opened on the North Shore was in the late 1970’s. A new senior school is long overdue.

“The Government is trifling with the future of the education of young people in refusing to provide schools of a reasonable size, namely about 1500 students, rather than the massive High Schools which are being created at the present time,” said Mr Jones.
