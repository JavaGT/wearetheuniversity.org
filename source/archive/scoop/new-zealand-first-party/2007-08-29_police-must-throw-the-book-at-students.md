Police Must Throw The Book At Students

New Zealand First law and order spokesman Ron Mark urges Police to carry through with riot charges against students involved in the weekend’s mayhem in Dunedin, to remove the possibility of them being let off with a diversion.

“This is the second year running that a small number of students have descended into such lawlessness, bringing the universities of Otago and Canterbury into disrepute.

“Students cannot be immune from conviction just because it might blight their record, as has happened in the past. They need to find out there will be consequences for the level of destruction and damage they caused.

“To simply give them diversions would be to fail to deliver the strongest possible message, that this sort of behaviour cannot be tolerated. If all that happens is a slap on the wrist by the forces of the law, no doubt Dunedin can expect the same again next year.

In addition, Mr Mark says that Police must look at their response to the rioting.

“New Zealand First wants to know what Police’s plan of action was, both pre-event and as the situation developed, and to be assured that their preparation was complete.

“It is of paramount importance that no general duties officers were put at unnecessary risk as a result of any failure to properly prepare and deploy for the event, given last year’s riot and the potential for that to be repeated,” concluded Mr Mark.
