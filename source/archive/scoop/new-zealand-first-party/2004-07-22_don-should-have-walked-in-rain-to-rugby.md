Don Should Have Walked In Rain To Rugby

Don Should Have Walked In Rain To Rugby

Rt Hon Winston Peters says unlike Don Brash he walked in the rain to the rugby test between the All Blacks and Australia in Wellington like thousands of other people and at no stage did he seek a ride in a motorcade.

This follows reports that National’s leader forgot his “one rule for all” and hitched a ride with the police to the game.

Mr Peters said today that as the leader of the third largest party in Parliament and a former rugby player, he was probably a better official choice for test matches than either Helen Clark or Don Brash.

“However we in New Zealand First are happy to rough it with ordinary kiwis even if that means a walk in the rain because, after all, rugby is a winter game.

“We can understand why the Prime Minister might travel in a motorcade but someone in Don Brash’s position should have called a taxi, caught a bus or walked to the stadium.

“His attitude reminds me of the pigs in George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’ who were more equal than the other animals,” said Mr Peters.
