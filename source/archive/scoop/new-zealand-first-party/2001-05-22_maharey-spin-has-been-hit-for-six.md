Maharey’ Spin Has Been Hit For Six
==================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

“The public is finally beginning to read the spin over tertiary funding with which Associate Minister of Education, Steve Maharey has beguiled it over the last eighteen months,” New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly MP said today.

“Maharey has continued to talk in slogans but the Governments actions have not matched his rhetoric.

Real per capita funding of tertiary institutions has dropped dramatically since 1999. Last year’s fee stabilisation process dropped the percentage of course costs even further and, combined with unique inflationary costs, really squeezed our tertiary institutions.

A further cut will be disastrous. Tertiary institutions have no alternative but to make dramatic protest so the public knows what is really going on,” Mr Donnelly said.
