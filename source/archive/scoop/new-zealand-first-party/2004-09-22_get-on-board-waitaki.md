Get On Board Waitaki

New Zealand First says that it is pleasing that water allocation for the Waitaki River catchment will finally be advanced.

“Our consistent wish for the Waitaki River legislation to go ahead despite the collapse of Project Aqua has been realised and can only be good for the people of the Waitaki region,” said Local Government and Environment spokesperson Jim Peters.

“However, the Waitaki Catchment Water Allocation Board, working with Environment Canterbury, have a complex and difficult task ahead of them, and successful planning hinges on community input.

“New Zealand First encourages all locals and interested parties who made submissions to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee to make submissions and be heard by the new board.

“The importance of river knowledge and water management from the time rain falls in our catchments and enters our rivers and lakes is vital in securing our recreational and business future,” said Mr Peters.
