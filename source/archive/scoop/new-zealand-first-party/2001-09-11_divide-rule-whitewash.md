Divide – Rule - Whitewash
=========================

Today’s decision by the Government to launch one review and two inquiries into the Defence debacle smacks of classic divide and rule tactics, says New Zealand First Spokesman for Defence Ron Mark MP.

“The review into responsibilities and accountabilities will not result in the cancellation of what we now know to be an unaffordable and unsound decision to motorise the New Zealand Army and so we will still, at the end of the day, have wasted at least $700 million.

“The inquiry into standards of behaviour and document leaks, is designed to shoot those messengers who were justifiably disgusted with the actions of their senior officers, but who had no other way of bringing matters to the attention of the House of Representatives. Rather than being purged they should be receiving medals,” said Mr Mark.

“The inquiry into the now infamous Gordon letter, is deserving of a full Commission of Inquiry in order that government Ministers, academics and officers, both serving and past, might be cross examined on oath. Such is the level of public concern of the constitutional issues involved.

“This government knows that all of the issues raised are inter-related and the only way the full truth will ever be brought out into the public arena is if there is one formal, independent Commission of Inquiry, absolutely free of government control or the perceptions of government control.

“Anything less than this will be seen for what it is, that being a government orchestrated whitewash,” said Mr Mark.
