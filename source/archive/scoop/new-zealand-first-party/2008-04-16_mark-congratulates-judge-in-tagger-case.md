Mark Congratulates Judge in Tagger Case

New Zealand First law and order spokesman Ron Mark has welcomed a 28-day sentence handed down yesterday to a tagger by Judge Tony Adeane.

“The judge’s comments, that tagging is neither art nor culture but covert, criminal behaviour, come as a voice of judicial sanity in the wilderness of PC speak and send a clear message to all of those who view graffiti and tagging as some sort of ‘art crime’,” Said Mr Mark.

“It is a serious crime that destroys private property, causes untold misery for ordinary householders and businesses, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to clean up.

“It is clear that this is one judge who recognises that law-abiding citizens in NZ have had a gutsful and that their collective patience is at breaking point.

“The question is now whether the rest of the judiciary have the courage to reinforce this action on a national scale.

“Well done, Judge Adeane,” said Mr Mark.
