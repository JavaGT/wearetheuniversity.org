Mallard’s Remarks Insulting - says Donnelly

‘Remarks by the Minister of Education are not only insulting to the MPs who worked on the review of the teaching of reading in NZ, it is also a denunciation of his own Ministry employees’, NZ First education spokesperson Brian Donnelly said today.

The subcommittee had extensive briefing by Ministry officials and had the person responsible for the delivery of the government’s Literacy Strategy as a permanent advisor. Members travelled to South Auckland and observed in action in the classroom the initiative Mr Mallard is using to demonstrate what his government is doing. We also spent two hours in intensive dialogue with the Auckland University Academics leading this initiative.

‘Mr Mallard is now on notice. The select committee report will be a reference point against which his Ministry will be judged. Where he claims that the current work programme will meet recommendations, he will be held to account that adequate resourcing and programming have been provided to make the right things happen’, said Mr Donnelly.

Brian Donnelly chaired the subcommittee of the education and science select committee which carried out the review.
