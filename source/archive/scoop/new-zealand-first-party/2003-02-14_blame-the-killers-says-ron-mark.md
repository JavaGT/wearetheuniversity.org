Blame The Killers Says Ron Mark

New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark has warned against placing all the blame on police and state agencies for the death of Michael Choy.

“Finger pointing and blame shifting is futile. There is no doubt that Michael Choy’s killers were young troublemakers but it is doubtful whether anyone could have predicted that they would kill someone.

“There is nothing to gain by accusing police and social workers of failure and by treating the killers as the victims – the real victims are Michael Choy and his family.

“The sinister attack that killed the pizza delivery man was planned and these young people knew full well what the result of their actions would be,” said Mr Mark.

“Child Youth and Family could have visited Mr Choy’s killers a thousand times but when it mattered, it was their choice to attack him with a baseball bat in a dark driveway.

“As long as the community makes excuses for individuals’ actions and blames social agencies for every social problem, we will never control crime,” said Mr Mark.

“New Zealand First believes that young people are aware of their actions and that must be reflected in a lowering of the age of criminal responsibility,” he added.
