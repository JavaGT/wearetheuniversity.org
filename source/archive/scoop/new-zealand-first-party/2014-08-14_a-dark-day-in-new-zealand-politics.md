A Dark Day in New Zealand Politics

A Dark Day in New Zealand Politics

Author Nicky Hager’s book is a most disappointing expose that reveals a Nixonian element arising in New Zealand politics, says New Zealand First.

“In short, taxpayers resources have been used both publicly and privately to attack all manner of public figures with the objective of gaining political advantage,” says Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Of course there will be denials but this story is about the communications between the accused and they cannot deny it.

“This is the story of what the accused did in thousands of emails showing their behaviour.

“Sadly for the Prime Minister it goes to his office in the same way it went to Nixon’s office during the Watergate scandal.

“New Zealanders who for so long did not believe, or did not want to believe, that we would politically behave this way, like the release of the emails behind the book “The Hollow Men”, now have to admit that this is the political environment which now prevails.

“The basis is the emails of the accused and frankly it is senseless for them to try to deny it.

“This is a very dark day in New Zealand politics,” says Mr Peters.
