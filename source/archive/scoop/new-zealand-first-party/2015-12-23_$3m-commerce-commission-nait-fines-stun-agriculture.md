$3m Commerce Commission Nait Fines Stun Agriculture
===================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters

New Zealand First Leader

Member of Parliament for Northland  
23 DECEMBER 2015  

$3m Commerce Commission Nait Fines Stun Agriculture

  
Fines totaling $3.17m against PGG Wrightson and Rural Livestock reveals major issues with the National Animal Identification and Tracing (NAIT) scheme.

“There are clearly issues with the government’s ‘value-adding’ NAIT scheme, when livestock firms are hit by multi-million dollar fines,” says the Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“These fines represent the bureaucratic botch-up introduced by NAIT and has major implications. It leaves industry and farmers high and dry trying to figure out who pays for missing NAIT tags at saleyards, or for that matter, at a meatworks.

“Given two-percent of NAIT tags are believed to fall out, this could affect hundreds of thousands of deer and cattle each year.

“The government must now act because they introduced NAIT. New Zealand First wants NAIT personnel put into saleyards and meatworks to resolve missing tags at no charge,” Mr Peters said.
