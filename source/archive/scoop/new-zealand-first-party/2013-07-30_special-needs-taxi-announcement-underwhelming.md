Special Needs Taxi Announcement Underwhelming

Special Needs Taxi Announcement Underwhelming

New Zealand First says the Government’s response to fixing the transport calamities experienced by some of our most vulnerable special needs students is underwhelming.

The Government announced today a new complaints process and more accessible information for the special education school transport assistance (SESTA) services.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says there have been reports of taxis arriving late or not showing up at all, and drivers who have dropped off children when there has been no one is home to care for them.

“Is this all the Government can come up with, a better complaints procedure and some literature?

“By simply reviewing the complaints procedure but doing nothing to fix the actual problem is not going to get these students to and from school safely.

“Is this part of the wrap around service promised by the Government when they shut down special schools and slashed classroom assistance for special needs students?

“The Government’s penny pinching has created even more stress for these students and their families and today’s announcement changes nothing,” says Ms Martin.
