NZ Awash with Immigrant Crime

**NZ Awash with Immigrant Crime**

Rt Hon Winston Peters says the $120 million drugs and property bust yesterday shows that Immigration New Zealand and its political masters have no idea they are bringing organised crime into the country.

More than 330kg of pseudoephedrine was seized in the bust and it is believed to have been smuggled in from China in shipping containers.

Mr Peters says it is significant that interpreters for the Mandarin, Cantonese and Korean languages were needed in court, although all of the accused are permanent residents or New Zealand citizens.

“We have warned for many years that successive governments were blindly importing people without any idea of their criminal backgrounds and this case proves it.

“There was obviously some immigration fraud because of the language issue and the fact that crime was being carried out on such a massive scale.”

Mr Peters says there was a lone voice at Immigration New Zealand warning against fast track visas and the shonky visa arrangements organised by the present government.

“There will be many more cases of organised crime surfacing in the forthcoming months and years and it has been helped by lax immigration policies and a dysfunctional department.

“When governments allow the Mr and Mrs Bigs of the Asian Drugs World into New Zealand they expose thousands of New Zealanders to lives of misery and crime.

“It’s long past time to start securely guarding our borders against people who use our residency and citizenship laws to commit crime,” says Mr Peters.
