Desirability Index Desirable
============================

"The suggestion by the Tertiary Education Advisory Committee in its third report that a desirability formula for tertiary courses be established is a sound idea," says New Zealand First's Education Spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

"At present tax-payers are funding all sorts of weird courses and would be horrified at the nature of some of them. The fundamental outlook of the last government was 'anything goes and the market will determine'.

"That has become a nonsense. Government has a responsibility to use taxpayers money wisely and in the best interests of the nation. Should we be funding courses in astrology and the sexual practices of ancient Egyptians when learning in critical areas of science and technology are being under-resourced.

"Rational and planned use of the education dollar is critical for the future well-being of the nation," concluded Mr Donnelly.
