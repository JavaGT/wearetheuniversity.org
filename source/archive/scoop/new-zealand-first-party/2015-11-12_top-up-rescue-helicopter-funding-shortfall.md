Top up Rescue Helicopter Funding Shortfall

Top up Rescue Helicopter Funding Shortfall

Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters is calling on the government to pick up the tab for the huge shortfall in funding for the region’s rescue helicopter.

“The loss of $75,000 in funding from Northland Regional Council is unacceptable,” Mr Peters, the New Zealand First Leader, said.

“The government must step in, particularly for neglected regional areas which struggle more than urban centres to raise money.

“The Northland Emergency Services Trust (NEST) service cannot be expected to take on the added burden of more fundraising.

“Let’s make no mistake, without the staff, volunteers and massive fundraising there would be no rescue helicopter to save lives in Northland.

“The service is crucial for Northlanders and the thousands of tourists who visit each year.

“Governments that reduced regional health services, and centralised them in the cities, should have budgeted for ambulances and air services to fill the gap – it’s the government’s duty now to put in a weighty contribution. Rescue helicopters are vital in saving lives.”
