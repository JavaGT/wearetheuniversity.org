Donnelly To Accept Anti-Pot Petition

New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly MP, is pleased that the School Trustees Association has managed to gather 36,000 signatures against the legalisation or decriminalisation of cannabis.

The petition will be presented to Mr Donnelly on the steps of Parliament at 1:00pm tomorrow before being submitted to the Health Select Committee.

“The Government needs to listen to the voice of the NZSTA whose members spend tens of thousands of voluntary hours having to deal with the devastating effects of this drug on young people. The decriminalisation or legalisation of cannabis will make the task of educating those students impossible,” said Mr Donnelly.

“New Zealand First will be voting against any measure to weaken the laws on marijuana as we have done in the past. We are urging the Government not to be blackmailed by the Greens on this issue, for the sake of our children, concluded Mr Donnelly.

ENDS
