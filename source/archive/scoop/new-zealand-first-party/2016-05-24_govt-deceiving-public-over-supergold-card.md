Govt Deceiving Public Over Supergold Card
=========================================

Govt Deceiving Public Over Supergold Card

Auckland senior citizens have good reason not to trust the Prime Minister and the National Government who are working to destroy the SuperGold Card, according to New Zealand First.

“On 6 April, Mr Key said ‘the entitlements for the SuperGold Card are not changing’ but on 1 July, 650,000 senior citizens must spend $15 if they want to use public transport in Auckland,” New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters says.

“When questioned in Parliament today the Prime Minister’s lame excuse was that this was the advice he had been given.

“Auckland Transport’s Swap to the Hop card has been an almighty flop wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars as well as confusing and stressing out thousands of senior citizens.

“We’ve been advised 50,000 seniors have already bought a blue Hop card which will have to be changed at great cost.

“We have discovered also that Auckland Transport has deceitfully used the SuperGold Card branding and will print gold Hop cards meaning those 50,000 people have to get new cards.

“This is a complete waste of money and Auckland Transport have been forced by government into being deliberately deceitful about it.

“The Prime Minister is trying to make out nothing has changed and that the SuperGold Card and the Hop card are the same. They are NOT,” Mr Peters says.
