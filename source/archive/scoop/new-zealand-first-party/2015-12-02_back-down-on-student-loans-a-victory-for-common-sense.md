Back Down on Student Loans a Victory for Common Sense

Back Down on Student Loans a Victory for Common Sense

New Zealand First is calling for Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce to apologise to hundreds of medical students for causing them stress and financial hardship.

“For five years the Minister has claimed that seven years of a student loan is enough for a medical degree, which usually takes nine years of study,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“He’s maintained that the government’s limit on access to the loan beyond seven years ‘isn’t a problem’.

“But now he has had a light bulb moment. As a consequence he’s backed down. It’s time to apologise.

“We’ve taken every opportunity to question the government about consequences of the cap in select committees and parliamentary debates,” says Mrs Martin.

Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart says the cap affected about a third of medical students.

“The Minister once absurdly told students to get a bank loan or borrow elsewhere.

“There is a critical shortage of New Zealand-trained doctors and this policy has intensified the shortage.

“New Zealand First has been vocal in its support for student medical associations and their opposition to the cap,” says Mrs Stewart.

“New Zealand First joins with students to celebrate Minister Joyce’s backdown as it represents a victory for students, and for common sense,” the MPs say.
