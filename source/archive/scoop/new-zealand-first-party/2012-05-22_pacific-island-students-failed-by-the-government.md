Pacific Island Students Failed By The Government

**Pacific Island Students Failed By The Government**

New Zealand First is asking the Government to implement changes to the education system to help Pacific Island students get better results at school.

The call for change comes after the Education Review Office said yesterday that there has been little progress in improving the achievements of students from Pacific cultures.

Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson Asenati Lole-Taylor says the Government identified in 2009 that an urgent focus was required to lift Pacific students’ learning performance.

“The Government is failing Pacific Island students who will make up a significant part of the workforce in the coming years.

“Government inaction today will sentence a significant proportion of these students to a future of low-paid, unskilled work.

“Programmes introduced at individual schools that have proven to be helpful to Pacific students should be introduced by the Government to schools nationwide.”

Mrs Lole-Taylor says Government funding cuts to community-based groups are also playing a significant role in the under-performance of Pacific students

“The Government should budget adequate funding for Pacific Island community groups including those that help with education – just as they do for Māori.”
