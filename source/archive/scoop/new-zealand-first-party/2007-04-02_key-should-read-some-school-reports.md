Key Should Read Some School Reports

New Zealand First education spokesperson Brian Donnelly says National leader John Key is out of touch with the assessment tools used by primary school teachers and has accused National of watering down its national standards policy.

"The reality is New Zealand schools have a huge range of tools available for numeracy and literacy assessment. Some of these are highly sophisticated and provide clear information about how well a child is progressing compared to peers," said Mr Donnelly.

"I encourage Mr Key to read some primary school reports to see whether they really do read like 'real estate ads' as he has suggested.

"Mr Key isn't proposing anything that isn't already being done in primary schools. Students' progress is already being assessed against the sets of learning objectives in the national curriculum statements, which identify broad levels of achievement in knowledge, understanding, skills, and attitudes.

"National's plan for primary school assessment standards is yet another example of rhetoric that appeals to popular prejudice, but which adds nothing of substance to education practice," concluded Mr Donnelly.
