Eru Investigation – About Time

New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark applauds the Minister of Corrections, Paul Swain, for finally launching an investigation into the Emergency Response Unit (ERU) in Canterbury.

Mr Mark has been pushing for the ERU, better known as the “Goon Squad”, to be investigated for sometime.

“Since the goon squads dis-establishment in July 2000 a number of serious allegations of inappropriate behaviour have been made against the unit but no inquiry has ever taken place,” said Mr Mark.

“This investigation is long overdue and very welcome, however it is a shame that it has only come because of continued pressure on the Minister.

“If the Minister requires any assistance with an appropriate terms of reference to ensure the widest possible review of considerable inappropriate activity by this unit, I would be happy to assist in that regard,” concluded Mr Mark.
