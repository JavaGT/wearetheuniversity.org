Come clean Over Timaru Oil Spill Says Peters

Come clean Over Timaru Oil Spill Says Peters

New Zealand First has called on Environment Canterbury and Timaru Port authorities to reveal the extent of a major oil spill in the area during the week.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says he has been reliably informed that 40,000 litres of fuel was spilled and all that authorities will reveal is that it was a “significant” amount.

Mr Peters says the people of South Canterbury have a right to know the extent of the pollution on their coastline and what is being done about it.

“This oil spill from a deep sea fishing boat happened because someone made a mistake.

“An alarm should have sounded that the oil was going into the sea and an inquiry should establish whether this safety system failed.

“Too many ships are causing problems. The wreck of the Rena is still causing headaches in the Bay of Plenty and further up the Coromandel coastline.

“It’s time the government and the maritime authorities took some responsibility for what is happening to our coastline before there is an event of catastrophic proportion,” says Mr Peters.
