National Embraces the Mushroom Principle – No Bull

**National Embraces the Mushroom Principle – No Bull**

The government has adopted the “mushroom principle” as it works to allow the importation of European mushroom compost containing animal waste, says New Zealand First.

“It may have passed this government’s notice but New Zealand doesn’t exactly want for high-quality compost,” says Spokesperson for Biosecurity Richard Prosser.

“We were shocked to find imports of mushroom compost called substrate from Europe, but it gets worse. The National Government is working on a new import health standard, which will allow the importation of mushroom compost containing animal manure.

“This is patently absurd and dangerous. There were foot and mouth outbreaks as little as five years ago in Europe. In the meantime, supposedly certified fodder beet seeds, also from Europe, were contaminated with the pest plant velvet leaf spreading it from Auckland to Southland.

“Only a few years ago supposedly certified European beef was found to be horse meat. The upshot being that New Zealand cannot afford the ‘she’ll be right’ approach to biosecurity shown by this government,” says Mr Prosser.

_Question: If the recent mass velvet leaf incursion was traced to imported seed lines that were certified as meeting New Zealand biosecurity requirements, what biosecurity risks, if any, are associated with mushroom substrate?_

Answer Text: The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has assessed the risks of mushroom substrate and identified a small number of pathogens and potential contamination risks that need to be managed. MPI will not allow the import until the activities undertaken offshore will manage the identified risks. MPI will verify compliance of the activities conducted offshore on arrival in New Zealand.

_Question: Can he confirm that shipments of mushroom substrate currently en-route to New Zealand, if any, will be refused an Import Health Standard; and if not, why?  
_  
Answer Text: No shipments are currently en-route to New Zealand. Further imports will not be allowed until after the Ministry for Primary Industries has issued import health standards which cover this type of product.

_Question: If other companies can produce substrate in New Zealand, why is MPI reportedly developing a new Import Health Standard to cover the importation of animal-based manure, if any?  
_  
Answer Text: As a country that operates under basic fair trading principles, the local production of any substance does not preclude the importation of similar substances which produce higher quality mushrooms with substantially better yields.
