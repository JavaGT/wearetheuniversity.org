Winston Peters Tells Aussies the GC is a Load of Rubbish

New Zealand First Leader

**Winston Peters Tells Aussies the GC is a Load of Rubbish**  
  
New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters has this evening told thousands of Australian radio listeners his views on controversial television show _The GC._

Mr Peters said earlier today this hedonistic programme should never have received state funding.

“Why would the Government, through NZ On Air, give $420,000 for a TV programme that shows Kiwis earning high Aussie wages while living a degenerate party lifestyle?  
“If this is the best they can do then they need to have their heads examined.

“We are all sick of the chardonnay-sipping, pinky finger-pointing liberals creating this sort of rubbish with taxpayer-dollars.

“We need to put people on the NZ On Air board who show a bit more intelligence than those who chose to fund this brain-dead show.

“But maybe _The GC_ is a sly National Party plot to tempt young Kiwis to Australia so they can claim to have reduced New Zealand’s shocking unemployment levels.

“Nothing else they’ve tried has worked, so who knows?

“Even the title of the show has a dual-meaning which is not just seriously repulsive to women but to all right-thinking members of society.”

Mr Peters says the programme’s much-hyped Māori cultural content is virtually non-existent.

“Just showing a few scribbles on their faces is hardly going to satisfy the cultural requirement.”

Mr Peters was interviewed live shortly after 5pm today on Sydney radio talkback station 2GB.
