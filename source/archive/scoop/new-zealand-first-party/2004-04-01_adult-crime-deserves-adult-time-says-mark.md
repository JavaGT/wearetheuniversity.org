Adult Crime Deserves Adult Time Says Mark

New Zealand First Law and Order spokesperson Ron Mark has renewed his calls for tougher penalties for youth offenders who commit serious violent crimes.

A 14-year-old North Canterbury student has admitted raping a schoolgirl in a Kaiapoi cemetery.

“The judge faces a serious dilemma in sentencing this sex attacker because of his age and there is a real risk he will soon be out preying on young girls again,” said Mr Mark.

“If this young offender is not stopped now after committing such a horrendous crime then who knows what he will be capable of in the future.

“My private members bill is designed to lower the age of criminal responsibility for offenders like this boy.

“The maximum sentence that he will receive will not act as a deterrent. He needs to be taken out of circulation and taught the hard way that his behaviour will not be unpunished.

“The purpose of my private members bill is to remove undesirable characters like this boy from society to protect young girls,” concluded Mr Mark.
