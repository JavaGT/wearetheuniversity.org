National Starts To Fight Dirty On Super Fund
============================================

**Wednesday, 25 July 2001, 12:33 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**National Starts To Fight Dirty On Superannuation Fund**

The National Party has lost its academic argument over the establishment of a superannuation fund and has resorted to trying to scare retired people into believing that their services will be cut.

Mr Peters was responding to a press release by novice National MP Lynda Scott which said that health, education and welfare services were about to be cut.

“I am absolutely appalled by Ms Scott’s release. The National Party has chosen to avoid the real debate about the fund and have instead resorted to trying to scare the most vulnerable members of society.

“This is a sign that the National Party have long since lost the battle of ideas and have resorted to these dirty tactics. We in New Zealand First will continue to talk about the rational reasons to support the fund.
