Migrants Should Speak English Says Peters

New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters has demanded that the Government stop importing tens of thousands of immigrants who don’t speak English.

He said today that it was “scandalous” that about 300,000 people in this country were officially described as speaking little or no English, although he suspected that the figure was actually much higher.

Mr Peters said the number was revealed in the announcement yesterday that foreigners will be able to talk to key government agencies in thirty different languages over the phone.

“This country is groaning under the weight of indiscriminate immigration, particularly in Auckland and the latest move shows that immigrants are not required to fit in here but are given free access to all the benefits on offer.

“Our schools are overloaded with foreign students, hospitals cannot cope and the ugly face of imported crime is showing itself in major centres with murders, kidnapping and extortion.

“Even Auckland’s Mayor John Banks belatedly realises that the situation is now out of hand with his call for a coherent immigration plan.

“Future generations of New Zealanders will look back on this Government with both regret and anger,” Mr Peters said.

“English should be a basic requirement of anyone coming into this country unless they are genuine refugees escaping from circumstances that qualify them to be part of our annual quota.”
