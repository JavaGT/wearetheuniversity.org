**Inspiring Education Pioneer Remembered**

New Zealand First joins with the rest of New Zealand in recognizing the loss of one of the country’s foremost pioneers of parental involvement in education, Dr Marie Bell, who passed away on Saturday in Wellington.

Women’s Affairs and Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says “Dr Bell was a “mover and shaker” in the field of early childhood education with her work alongside others developing the Playcentre and Parents Centre movement.”

“She believed in children learning through free play which is the basis of child initiated learning that has revolutionized early childhood education and empowered parents all over New Zealand.”

“Dr Bell was an inspirational woman who saw a need and worked tirelessly to support both children and parents. She returned to Victoria University at the age of 82 to complete her doctorate, and in doing so broke barriers and was a positive role model for women and older citizens.

“She will be sadly missed and our thoughts go out to her family and friends at this time,” Ms Martin says.
