Middle Schools The Way Forward – NZ FIRST

“The government’s proposal to build two junior high schools in the Flatbush Area is sound educationally, but it is using the wrong language,” says New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“Junior high schools are considered to be replicas of senior high schools with clear subject differentiation, specialist teachers, and students moving to teachers. Middle schools cover the same age levels but operate with a more integrated curriculum, with semi-specialisation and home-room based learning.”

“New Zealand First has long been an advocate for middle schools because we believe this form of schooling best meets the needs of emerging adolescents. Indeed the age we currently require students to make the transition from one form of schooling to the other is at the very worst stage of their development, when their emerging concept of self is at its most vulnerable.”

“We congratulate the government for its bold decision, but urge it to get the concept right,” said Mr Donnelly.
