Too Little Money to Run Regional Health

Barbara Stewart MP  
Spokesperson for Health

Too Little Money to Run Regional Health

  
Penny pinching on health spending for the regions is failing New Zealanders, says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“The government blames district health boards but the lack of money for health services goes straight to National’s meanness to the provinces.

“There was no new money earmarked for rural health in the 2015 Budget.

“Southern District Health Board is cutting spending across health centres by 5 per cent, including at Oamaru Hospital and Dunstan Hospital in Central Otago, because the government is not providing enough funding.

“This will mean the region will lose half their inpatient beds and will lose acute cardiac care in Wanaka.

“Minister of Health Jonathan Coleman has the overall responsibility for ensuring all New Zealanders have access to quality healthcare.

“The government is creating a two-tier health system with rural communities on the lower tier, they are not a priority for the Minister,” says Mrs Stewart.
