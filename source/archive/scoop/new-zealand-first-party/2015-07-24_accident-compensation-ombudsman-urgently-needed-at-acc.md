Accident Compensation Ombudsman Urgently Needed at ACC

New Zealand First is calling for the establishment of an Accident Compensation Ombudsman to stop New Zealanders being unfairly disadvantaged when challenging ACC decisions.

“A report released by Acclaim Otago highlighted serious barriers to New Zealanders when challenging ACC decisions and this urgently needs to change,” says Barbara Stewart, New Zealand First ACC Spokesperson.  
“My office is always inundated with complaints from Kiwis frustrated at the lack of transparency from ACC and its review process. There is an overwhelming feeling that they have been let down by a biased system designed only to benefit the government’s bottom line.

“New Zealand First supports the appointment of an Accident Compensation Ombudsman with similar power as the Health and Disability Commissioner, to make independent judgements regarding ACC decisions and ensure a fair and transparent review system.

“The ACC Minister needs to make drastic changes so the rights of New Zealanders are upheld throughout the ACC appeals process. An Accident Compensation Ombudsman would achieve this aim,” says Mrs Stewart.
