Short-sighted graduate export scheme

**Short-sighted graduate export scheme**

New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin says the latest plan to change the student loan scheme will send more graduates to the departure gate to jump on the next flight out of the country.

The government announced yesterday that it is looking to make changes to the student loan scheme to softening up the New Zealand Public for the Budget later this month.

Ms Martin says the policy is short-sighted and actually penalises those graduates who choose to stay and work in their country.

“Rather than attacking those graduates who have stayed in New Zealand, diligently paying back their loans, paying their taxes and using local goods and services, the government would perhaps be better off abandoning their tax cuts to the wealthiest New Zealanders and using that money towards enabling more young New Zealanders to study.”

Ms Martin suggests that instead of raising the repayment threshold, which would have a negative effect on many graduates, the government could adopt New Zealand First’s policy of a ‘dollar for dollar’ student debt write off scheme for graduates who remain and work in New Zealand.

“As the government currently writes off 44.7 cents in every dollar borrowed, our policy is almost fiscally neutral and socially responsible.

“Instead of working with New Zealand First on policy that will encourage a more immediate repayment of student debt and retain our best and brightest in New Zealand, this government is putting yet another incentive in place for our graduates to leave,” says Ms Martin.
