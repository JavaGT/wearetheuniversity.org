Loss of More Land to Foreign Interests a Betrayal

Loss of More New Zealand Land to Foreign Interests a Betrayal

Rt Hon Winston Peters says the Overseas Investment Office (OIO) has again betrayed New Zealanders with the sale of one of the country’s biggest farms to North American interests.

Mt Pember Station in Canterbury’s Lees Valley is an amalgamation of seven runs and farms and is more than 27,000 hectares in size. It carries more than 50,000 head of stock.

Mr Peters says New Zealand lives and dies by its land and sea resources and the OIO is following the National Party’s rules by simply rubberstamping the sale and transferring big chunks of local wealth to North America.

“These people will not learn. We should not be selling our precious resources to foreign interests. It does not matter who they are or where they come from.

“This Government has no thought for the future of this country and it is leaving nothing for future generations.

“The best way to destroy a nation and its people is to take away their land. History has proved this over and over again,” says Mr Peters.
