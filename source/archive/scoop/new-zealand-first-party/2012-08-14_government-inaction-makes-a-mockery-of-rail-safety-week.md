Government Inaction Makes a Mockery of Rail Safety Week

**Government Inaction Makes a Mockery of Rail Safety Week**

New Zealand First is warning of a looming rail disaster unless Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee takes action to facilitate the rapid repair of thousands of rotting wooden sleepers.

Transport spokesperson Brendan Horan says KiwiRail has no idea exactly where the dangerously compromised sleepers are located on our rail network.

“But they are likely to be on some road crossings. If they gave way under a fully laden goods locomotive it could cause a catastrophic derailment with the loss of many lives.”

Mr Horan says KiwiRail assurances that about 7000 rotten sleepers would be replaced by December are laughable.

“How can they expect us to believe that when they have just announced that 181 maintenance staff will be made redundant by October?

“We implore Mr Brownlee to stop making a mockery of Rail Safety Week and step in to ensure the safety of our rail system,” says Mr Horan.
