Our Elderly: How Do We Treat Them?

New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Peter Brown says he is concerned to learn how badly some elderly people are being treated in rest homes and also while receiving home care.

He said that a number of “quite distressing” cases in the Waikato region had been drawn to his attention.

“At this juncture it is not my intention to cause alarm as I have no doubt the vast majority of elderly folk are being treated well.

“However, to learn of even a few cases which clearly fit into the category of elder abuse, is sufficient to signal that there might be a need for a formal inquiry into just how we treat elderly people in this country.

“Waikato-based New Zealand First MP Barbara Stewart has also has been alerted to situations where elderly people appear to have been mistreated.

“People who share my concern should contact myself or Barbara Stewart. A simple letter to either of us at Parliament will suffice,” concluded Mr Brown.
