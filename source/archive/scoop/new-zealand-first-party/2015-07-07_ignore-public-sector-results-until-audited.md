Ignore Public Sector Results until Audited
==========================================

Darroch Ball MP

Spokesperson for Social Development  
7 JULY 2015  

Ignore Public Sector Results until Audited

  
New Zealanders should ignore all “results” from the public sector, including education, police and social services, until they are independently scrutinised, says New Zealand First.

“Questions are being asked about NCEA results and manipulation of arrest statistics,” says Spokersperson for Social Development Darroch Ball. “The Salvation Army also questions the accuracy of social services statistics.

“The situation is now absurd with the government setting its own public service targets while it refuses to have the ‘achievements’ independently audited.

“We suggest that the government’s targets are simply putting pressure on everyone to achieve, and they are forced to do this in any way they can.

“Some schools have introduced ‘weaker’ subjects just so more students can get through.

“The government set their own targets in 2012, they have marked the results themselves, and are touting them as proof of improvement – with no independent oversight.

“New Zealanders deserve to have confidence in the results the government agencies produce,” says Mr Ball.

“The government should eliminate all doubt over the results and get them independently reviewed by the Office of the Auditor General.”
