Secondary Principals Paid Bonuses For Numbers Of Foreign Fee-Paying Students

New Zealand First has questioned the ethics of secondary principals being paid ‘bonuses’ based on the number of foreign fee-paying students attending their schools

School boards have to make a case to the Ministry of Education if they wish to pay their principals extra money for additional responsibilities.

In 2001, 10 requests were received, in 2002, 38 requests and in 2003, 51 requests were made. The number approved by the Ministry were 8 in 2001, 33 in 2002 and 38 in 2003.

“There is obviously an increasing trend for these bonuses,” said New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“It is wrong that principals should receive bonuses for the number of foreign fee-paying students they recruit. They are employed to look after the interests of New Zealand students – not to go on trips around the world on recruitment drives.

“Do principals get bonuses for achieving high rates of academic excellence? – No. Do they get bonuses for high levels of fundraising?– No.

“All the incentives are for principals to ignore the critical elements of educational leadership and to chase the export education dollar.

“This process brings the profession into disrepute and it is appalling that the Government condones this practice,” said Mr Donnelly.
