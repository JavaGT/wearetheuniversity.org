Media Release  
4 March 2004

Teacher Contribution To Success Of NCEA Needs Acknowledgement

“The successful implementation of the first stages of the NCEA, as recorded by the ERO review is largely attributable to the dedication of teachers,” says New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“There is no doubt that the implementation process was under-resourced, as highlighted by a select committee report in 2002. It is that under-resourcing which has been the main focus of many of the complaints about the new qualification.

“Regardless of their frustrations, teachers have typically been determined to make the system work and it is their commitment which has led to ERO’s findings.

“Away from the public glare, thousands of teachers have been beavering away at the chalkface and their efforts deserve recognition,” says Brian Donnelly.
