Labour's Gay Marriage Agenda Exposed As A Flop

Labour's Gay Marriage Agenda Exposed As A Flop

The revelation today that only 60 couples had applied for Civil Unions since April, with 15 of them being straight, highlights the true extent of Labour’s deception over this issue and exposes its gay marriage agenda as a flop, says Rt Hon Winston Peters.

Mr Peters was responding to the release of Civil Union figures from the Internal Affairs Ministry today.

Mr Peters told an audience in Timaru today that Labour had led the country to believe that there were thousands of gays who were clamoring to get married and had spent several weeks of parliament’s time, and tens of thousands of dollars, to push this agenda through for the tiniest of minorities.

“Where are these hordes of gays lining up to walk down the aisle?” asked Mr Peters.

“To put this into perspective, there are on average 1700 marriages a month in New Zealand, even in a day and age where most young people live together before they marry.

“This PC driven government has now left itself totally exposed over this issue. They inflicted a full frontal assault on the nation over gay marriage, without giving ordinary New Zealanders their say, and now it seems even the gay community doesn’t want it.

“New Zealanders can take comfort that at least one party in parliament is willing to stand up to Labour’s PC agenda bending programme – and that party is increasingly becoming New Zealander’s choice for change,” Mr Peters said.
