Profit Before People Agenda Hits Again

Profit Before People Agenda Hits Again

More jobs are being cut at New Zealand Post because the government continues to put profit before people, says New Zealand First.

“State-Owned Enterprises have a social responsibility to do good for the community but it’s clear the National Government has pushed NZ Post away from this important objective,” says Spokesperson for State-Owned Enterprises Richard Prosser.

“The loss of 70 jobs in Canterbury is going to have a wide-ranging impact not only on 70 families but the entire region.

“This is bad news for those working hard to rejuvenate and rebuild Christchurch city after the earthquakes.

“The suggestion that 40 of those jobs are being relocated to Auckland, to an already over-crowded, over-priced city is ludicrous.

“Auckland doesn’t need more residents – we need to keep these jobs in the regions.

“Since 2013, more than 400 people around the country have lost their jobs at New Zealand Post in the wake of the government’s blind pursuit of a surplus. It has to stop.

“New Zealand First believes that State-owned enterprises should be good for the community, the regions and the economy,” says Mr Prosser.
