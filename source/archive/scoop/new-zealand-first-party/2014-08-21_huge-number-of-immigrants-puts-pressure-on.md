Huge Number of Immigrants Puts Pressure on

  
New Zealand cannot deal with almost 800 people settling here every week - it is just not common sense, says New Zealand First.

“The government should hang its head in shame over today’s immigration figures with 140,000 Kiwis out of work and a housing crisis in Auckland,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The pressure on housing, jobs, our hospitals, schools and our welfare system from a near record 41,000 people settling here in the past year is unbearable and will squeeze these services for hardworking New Zealanders.

“This increase is related 67,984 work visas (up 3100) and nearly 90,000 student visas (up 4800) making the plight of Kiwi job seekers even worse.

“When the National government gave foreign students work rights they increased job competition and allowed ‘study” to be used as a means to permanent residency.

“Where is the export education policy now when it is our economy that is paying for foreign students to work here?

“The government is not monitoring immigration at all – it has an open door policy and its contributing to the fastest rate of population growth for over a decade.

“This is all about the economy trying to progress on the basis of consumerism and production.

“All the hype about a rock star economy was largely about the consumptive growth that goes with an increasing population

“There has been no real expansion in health, education and infrastructure to match this rapid population increase - belatedly the government has talked about building new schools just as the election campaign begins.

“No thought or planning has been given to the potential social and cultural consequences of this massive influx

“National’s irresponsible, unfocused immigration policy has taken no account of either the quantity or quality of immigrants – and New Zealanders, old and new, will pay a heavy price for this,” Mr Peters says.
