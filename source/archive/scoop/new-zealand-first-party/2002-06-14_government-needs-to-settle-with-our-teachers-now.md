Our Kids Are Suffering: Government Needs To Settle With Our Teachers Now

“Our secondary school teachers are not getting a fair go,” New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said today.

“Which Government Minister or MP has had a pay rise less than the inflation rate? Why is it that the Government can’t find a package to end the disruption in our schools.

“These disruptions in school life, and particularly in extra curricular activities, are permanent. The losses are forever. International comparisons suggest that we have a higher participation in sporting and other activities than many other nations. We are also aware that this is trending downwards. When this activity ceases many students drop out…..and never return.

“While this Government throws money around like an eight armed octopus for marginal adult activities it can’t find the means to make an investment in our nation’s future. It needs to settle with the teachers now,” Mr. Peters said.
