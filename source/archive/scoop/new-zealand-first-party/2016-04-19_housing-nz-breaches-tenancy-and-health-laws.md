Housing NZ Breaches Tenancy And Health Laws

**Housing NZ Breaches Tenancy And Health Laws**

Housing New Zealand is acting unlawfully by putting tenants into state houses without testing the houses for “P” contamination, says New Zealand First.

“More than 40 per cent of state houses tested for contamination are positive yet Housing New Zealand is knowingly putting thousands of families at risk by not testing before they move in,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Social Development Darroch Ball.

“Under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 landlords must provide a clean property so they should test for any signs of “P” before they rent a property.

“If landlords rent a property that is contaminated they are breaching their obligations under this law and under the Building Act and the Health Act.

“Landlords were warned this month by the Tenancy Tribunal that they will not be able to hide behind a lack of knowledge of meth contamination if the likelihood is overwhelming.

“Minister Responsible for Housing New Zealand Bill English has failed to address contamination even though information has been available to the government since 2009.

“Questions need to be answered by Mr English about the breaches by Housing NZ, which is the country’s biggest landlord. Its tenants are getting sick in an epidemic of contaminated houses.”
