Meridian Commended For Water Deal

New Zealand First has strongly commended Meridian Energy’s deal with McKenzie Basin farmers to provide 150 million cubic metres of water per year for irrigation.

“I am pleased that New Zealand First was the only party to have insisted upon the completion of the Waitaki catchment bill throughout the bill’s passage,” said local government and environment spokesperson Jim Peters.

“The announced agreement links back to the understanding developed by the 1969 Order in Council.

“Submissions and discussions throughout this year have centered around water allocation and issues still remain for much of the southern Waitaki River. I hope that the Aoraki Water Trust is also able to reach an accommodation with Meridian Energy.

“The economic potential for South Canterbury and Waimate is great, not only for irrigation but also for future hydro generation should the nearly formed water allocation board find that there is more water available for allocation.

“I hope that cooperation and goodwill will prevail for the better good of the community,” said Mr Peters.
