NZ First To Keep Up The Good Fight

The New Zealand First caucus has resolved to regroup and prepare to get back into Parliament at the next election.

After a “significant” discussion at a meeting today, Rt Hon Winston Peters said they would recommend to the party’s board that it continue to represent the interests of well over 90,000 voters who supported it last Saturday.

“We are going to carry on. The looming economic circumstances and the make up of the new government mean that our presence is needed more than ever.

“No one in the caucus is walking away. There is too much at stake over the next three years for us to turn our backs on tens of thousands of supporters.

“We will watch developments very closely and will not hesitate to speak out when the interests of ordinary people are being ignored or betrayed.

“We will also remember every promise that has been made and hold to account those who made them,” said Mr Peters.
