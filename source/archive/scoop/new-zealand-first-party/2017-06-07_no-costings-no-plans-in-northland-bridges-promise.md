No Costings, No Plans in Northland Bridges Promise

**No Costings, No Plans in Northland Bridges Promise**

More evidence has emerged that National dreamt up its two-lane bridges promise on the spur of the moment during the 2015 Northland by-election, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The original promise was that the 10 new bridges would cost between $32m and $69m. However, NZTA now says just four of those bridges will cost $62m.  
“That shows National had no plans and no costings for the 10 bridges. They just wanted a sound-bite.

“After neglecting Northland for decades they panicked when they realised the public had had enough, and latched on to the fact Northland had over a thousand single-lane bridges. They would not have known previously because Mr Joyce and Mr Key only discovered Northland in 2015.

“National even decided to build a two-lane bridge between two kauri trees, known as Darby and Joan, where there is no river. Darby and Joan already have an environmental prize winning ramp over the root system.

“The Prime Minister claimed in Parliament today there has been progress on the bridges – but in two years since the promise was made there are no new bridges, and building has not even started on one.”
