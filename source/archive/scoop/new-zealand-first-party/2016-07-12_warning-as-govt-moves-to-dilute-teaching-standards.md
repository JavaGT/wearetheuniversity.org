Warning as Govt Moves to Dilute Teaching Standards

Tracey Martin MP

Spokesperson for Education

Warning as Govt Moves to Dilute Teaching Standards

  
Teaching standards will drop as the government pushes the Charter Schools model into the state sector, says New Zealand First.

“It is happening with National’s Education Legislation Bill which sets up school positions for unqualified teachers,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“The government is allowing its support partner’s Charter Schools philosophy to seep into state schools.

“Charter Schools, the ACT Party’s pet policy, can employ unqualified and unregistered teachers.

“Parents and teachers will rightly be alarmed that this will undermine standards. Schools under funding pressure will feel obliged to take on unqualified staff as a cost-cutting measure.

“This is totally different to student teachers having practical experience in schools and beginner teachers working in schools under a mentor.

“New Zealand First did not support the government on putting unqualified trainee teachers in charge of classes, which was added to the Bill at the last minute.

“But the Education and Science Select committee, controlled by National, ignored our opposition and public submissions against it.”
