Kawerau Community Congratulated for Their Generosity

**KAWERAU COMMUNITY CONGRATULATED FOR THEIR GENEROSITY**

New Zealand First is applauding the community of Kawerau and others who have come together to support the new Tarawera High School.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the financial burden placed on families by the forced amalgamation of two local schools by Education Ministry has been eased through the generosity of New Zealanders.

“Students attending Tarawera High School next year will be given uniforms and stationery secured through sponsorship from within the community, and from other benefactors around the country.

“My hat comes off to this combined High School and all those who put their hands in their pockets to give these young people the best start for their 2013 academic year.”

Ms Martin says education decisions being made by bureaucrats in Wellington show a clear lack of understanding about the cost of their decisions on local communities.

“Christchurch is living through this stressful process right now.

“But with the Kiwi caring attitude it is starting to look like our communities will succeed in spite of the Government’s constant penny pinching and blatant attempts to grind our education system into the ground,” says Ms Martin.
