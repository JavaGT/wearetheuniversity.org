**National Playing Game of Pretence**

The Government needs to stop playing political games with the New Zealand public, says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Social Policy Le’aufa’amulia Asenati Lole-Taylor.

“The Government must stop sending out conflicting messages to the people of New Zealand,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.

“They must stop pretending they care about the thousands of volunteers who spend hours helping others when they won’t give volunteers the support they deserve.

“They must stop pretending that unemployment is not a problem, because their efforts to create jobs have failed. Instead, there have been many redundancies during their time in government.

“They must stop telling people that wages have increased because it means nothing when prices are higher and people cannot afford basic necessities, and children and grandchildren are now asking their grandparents for help.

“They must stop telling parents that social services are better when the bigger picture reveals thousands of students who go to school hungry and others who can no longer afford extra tuition because the Government has cut funding.

“They must stop dictating to local communities because community leaders have the expertise to deliver positive outcomes. What they need is resources to keep doing their work, but the Minister of Social Development has made it increasingly difficult for them to access funds.

“They must stop saying that it is easier to afford a home, when it is virtually impossible for the average Kiwi to afford a 20 per cent deposit for a home in the current economic climate.

“They need to stop creating confusion because the New Zealand public is not as naïve as this Government may think,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
