More Land Sold to Foreigners for Dairying

  
Purchases of New Zealand land by foreigners for dairying is increasing, says New Zealand First.

“The sale to foreign buyers of a 370-hectare farm in Oxford, Canterbury for development into dairy support has been approved by the Overseas Investment Office, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The American buyer was also allowed to buy 27,000-hectare Mt Pember Station, Lees Valley, in 2013, one of New Zealand’s biggest farms.

“The OIO, which has become a compliant rubber stamp, looks at ‘substantial and identifiable benefit to New Zealand’, but New Zealand First questions how foreign-owned dairy farms in New Zealand will benefit New Zealand and New Zealanders.

“The National government is neglecting future generations and failing to put our country’s industry first,” says Mr Peters.

“Many smaller blocks of land are also going to foreign buyers to gain a foothold to residency in New Zealand.”
