Take Responsibility Minister: Fund Maori Language Teaching

The Government is failing New Zealand children by not supporting the teaching of Māori in schools.

“The 2009 New Zealand Curriculum states clearly: ‘All students have the option to acquire knowledge of te reo Māori me ona tikanga,’” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Māori Affairs Pita Paraone.

“This is not an argument about making te reo compulsory in schools. This is about saying we want the learning of te reo to be funded as per the curriculum.  
“With the invasion of National Standards in our primary school system in 2010, this government diverted its resources away from the teaching of te reo, and has continued to forfeit its responsibility to fund it ever since.

“We need to fully support the teaching of te reo in our schools. This is the only way we will deliver the Māori Language Strategy to increase the status of the Maori language in New Zealand and increase the number of New Zealanders who can speak Māori.

“The solution is glaringly obvious. We need to upskill our current educators, employ more Resource Teachers of Maori, and fund the resources needed for them to succeed.

“New Zealand First has written to the Minister of Education Hekia Parata demanding to know how much is being spent to support the teaching of te reo in New Zealand classrooms.

“This is not, as the Minister would have us believe, going to lead to the oppression of the language, but actively promote greater understanding of both the Māori language and the Māori culture, and deliver the rounded education we expect from New Zealand schools,” says Mr Paraone.

“New Zealand First fully supports the full resourcing and delivery of the curriculum and calls on the National government to support future generations so they can enjoy all aspects of what it is to be a New Zealander, including our Māori culture.”
