Taxpayers Fund Foreign Children's Early Childhood Education

“Revelations that it is government policy to fully fund foreign children for early childhood education are flabbergasting,” says New Zealand First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“It is unbelievable that, at a time when this government claims it is trying to increase participation rates of New Zealand children in early childhood education, that much needed taxpayer funding is being used to pay for foreign children.

“At the compulsory and tertiary levels, foreign students have to pay for the education they are provided. Why should New Zealand taxpayers have to carry this burden at the early childhood level?

“The government’s policy is inconsistent, ill-considered and needs changing forthwith,” said Mr Donnelly.
