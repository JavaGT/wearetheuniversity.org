Labour’s Tertiary Policy A Sign Of Desperation

“Labour’s tertiary no-interest policy is a sign of electoral desperation,” says New Zealand First’s education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“Why has the government waited for almost six years to introduce such a unannounced policy? Why was this policy not flagged in the budget?”

“This is a crass ‘lolly scramble’ policy which doesn’t sit within a cohesive framework of financial support for tertiary education.

“The irony is that the policy will lead to increased student debt as students borrow to the max and pay back gold-plated loans as slowly as possible.

“This is a policy which is bedded in political pragmatism, not rational policy and it is a poisoned apple which should be resisted by students.

“New Zealand First believes the way to address student debt is through a universal living allowance,” said Mr Donnelly.
