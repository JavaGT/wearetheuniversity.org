NZ First Selects Hugh Barr For Ohariu

New Zealand First has selected scientist and outdoor recreation advocate Dr Hugh Barr as its candidate for Ohariu at the General Election on November 26.

Dr Barr has an extensive background, of over thirty years, in outdoor recreation, and similar experience as a consulting scientist dealing with many issues central to New Zealand’s prosperity and wellbeing.

He says he is especially concerned about restoring Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed, retaining ownership of New Zealand assets and the principle of one law for all New Zealanders.

Dr Barr wrote a book, “The Gathering Storm over the Foreshore and Seabed – Why it should remain in Crown ownership” to help the public understand the issue.

For the last year, he has been Co-Chair of the Coastal Coalition, a group of tens of thousands that campaigned against National’s legislation to allow privatisation of New Zealand’s foreshore and seabed to iwi groups.

Rt Hon Winston Peters describes Dr Barr as an outstanding New Zealander who has already made a significant contribution to science and outdoor recreation.

“His ability to identify and confront the main issues facing New Zealand is sorely needed at a time when the future ownership of our natural resources and publicly owned assets is at stake.

“Dr Barr will be reminding the people of Ohariu that they need a strong advocate for their rights and not someone who serves as a puppet to whatever political party is in power.

“We are delighted to have someone of his calibre carrying the message of New Zealand First,” says Mr. Peters.
