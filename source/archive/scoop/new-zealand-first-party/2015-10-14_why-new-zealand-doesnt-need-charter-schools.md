Why New Zealand Doesn’t Need Charter Schools

Spokesperson for Education

**MANUKURA ANOTHER PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY NEW ZEALAND DOESN’T NEED CHARTER SCHOOLS**

New Zealand First congratulates Manukura School in Palmerston North on securing its future through achieving special character status, but Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin says it raises the question of why we need charter schools.

“Manukura not only specialises in high performance sport but has an impressive range of academic subject choices both in school and by correspondence,” says Mrs Martin.

“However, as a state integrated school, it’s still not on a level playing field when compared with the funding model for charter schools.

“Manukura won’t receive the same level of funding as, for example, Vanguard Military charter school, despite Vanguard offering its students limited academic courses and only physical education that will take them into a Defence Force position.

“It is concerning that despite Manukura proving over nine years of performance that it would be a positive addition to the state school sector, it still took two years to gain its new status. New Zealand First wants to speed up that process,” says Mrs Martin.

“Manukura shows why we did not need the Education Act 1989 changes implemented by the National Government to allow Charter Schools.

“The mechanisms were already in place allowing schools wanting to deliver an education reflecting faith or a special educational philosophy to operate.

“New Zealand First made the commitment in its 2014 Manifesto to repeal the 2013 amendments to the Education Act 1989 that allowed the creation of charter schools alongside a review of the Designated Character Schools section in the Act.

“Manukura’s success in gaining special character status reinforces there is noneed for charter schools in New Zealand,” says Mrs Martin.
