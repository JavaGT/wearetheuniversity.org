**Are the Greens Just Marijuana Fans?**

New Zealand First says Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei is off the planet by claiming in a TV interview that Maori growing marijuana are developing entrepreneurial and horticultural skills.

Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says the reality of the situation is that people growing Marijuana are breaking the law to develop and feed the drug habits of thousands of New Zealanders.

“For Ms Turei to claim Maori growing marijuana in their backyard are entrepreneurs is nothing short of a joke which sends an appalling message to young Maori around the country.

“Next thing you know she’ll be claiming that operators of P-Labs deserve entrepreneurial scholarships.

“Ms Turei is so out of touch on this issue that it can’t help make one consider whether the notion that the Greens are a bunch of dope-smoking hippies is true,” says Mrs Stewart.
