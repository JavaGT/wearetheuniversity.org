Brendan Horan: Maiden Speech
============================

Brendan Horan: Maiden Speech  

Tena ano tatau e huihui mai, I runga I te ahuatanga, o tenei ra

Ko te kaupapa, ko taku whai korero tua tahi, I roto I tenei whare raiona, e tu ake nei

E mihi ana kia ratou ma, kua ngaro ki te po

Haere, haere, haere atu ra

Tatou nga kanohi ora, huri noa, I to tatou whare

Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena tatou katoa

The mountain of maori ancestors is Pirongia.

The blood and bones and therefore the wairua of my ancestors starts in the Waipa river

My waka is Tainui of which Hoturoa was the captain.

My iwi is Ngati Maniapoto.

My hapu, Ngati Hikairoa .

On my European side I am descended from Orm, the Viking.

On his way to Britain he lost his leg in battle, but had the presence of mind to save it, as no warrior could enter Valhalla unwhole.

When close to land he threw his leg onto the shore and thus by Viking law claimed that area.

This is why the Ormsby coat of arms proudly displays a severed leg and the motto “He is brave who is prudent.”

As a child I nearly didn’t make it.

At 2 years old I was hospitalized for seven months in Waikato hospital, my parents lived in Whakatane a six hour drive in those days over the then unsealed Kaimai ranges.

I flat lined 3 times and had the sacrament of extreme unction administered.

And so I will always have immense respect and appreciation for nurses, doctors, priests and caregivers.

Growing up in Whakatane, I was blessed with great friends and together we fished, surfed, played sport and learned with live with and nurture the land that supported us.

Because amenities were affordable we regularly visited the local swimming pool and developed civic pride, 20 cents entry fee.

Compare that to my local council swimming pool Baywave in Tauranga where entry and hydroslides costs 8 dollars for local children.

It’s no wonder children struggle to swim and one of my goals is to have gold coin entry to all swimming pools for all NZ school children.

But I digress….back to my childhood and whakatane when we were also blessed with great male role models.

Men like Mike Beeching, George Ferguson, Bruce Scott, Co Baart and Monty McGoughan.

They taught us to swim, surf, fish, connect with the land and to fiercely compete in sport, arming us with the confidence to back ourselves, a solid work ethic and they taught us the value of having perfect basics in our sporting disciplines.

Many young men and women from Whakatane have represented NZ in sport and travelled the world as I have done, thanks to men like this.

I would also like to acknowledge their wives.

As behind every great man is a usually a better woman – most times - telling him what to do and feeding him and in those days me too.

So for me, childhood was a golden time.

I could have become another statistic.

A child from a broken home in an era when single parent families were rare.

But Thanks to men and women with the heart and courage to care for all the children in their community – I am the man I am today. Because to them, community mattered.

Mr Speaker, I know a maiden speech is not supposed to mention anything too controversial, but there are things happening in our country now that are so wrong and I cannot countenance a philosophy of silence.

“Evil thrives when good men and women stand by and do nothing”

So I ask now – how can NZ have the highest child brutality and murder rate in the OECD , how can this possibly be NZ when we start the year with a baby being murdered in a small town, a 16 year old boy assaulting and raping a 5 year old girl and a young father being stabbed to death while sitting in his car waiting for a medical prescription.

The foul stench of these crimes lingers over our entire nation, but in particular those of us in the house today – as it has happened on OUR watch.

This is not the NZ I grew up in.

This is not the NZ that I want to bequeath to my children.

The protection and safety of all NZ children must be paramount.

We are all aware of the need – and decisive action must be taken.

If we have to step on a few toes and offend the politically correct – then so be it.

The next NZ child to be murdered will leave blood on all of our hands if we fail to act.

Mr Speaker, Ko Brendan taku ingoa - My name is Brendan and I stand before you today in this house, a product of my ancestors, respectful of all they have achieved and mindful of the new paths that I must forge to honor them.

I am a proud representative of the NZ First party and humbled by the support and hard work of the many people who sacrificed hours of time and effort to see NZ First back in parliament.

I would therefore like to thank everyone who voted for NZ First, the parents who remembered NZ First securing free medical care for children under 6. A policy that protects children and saves lives.

I would like to thank the small business owners who remembered when NZ First lowered business tax from 33 to 30% and I would like to thank the many Maori that voted for NZ First conscious of the settlements and concessions that NZ First and Winston Peters have secured.

And let me not forget the Supergold card holders who possess tangible evidence of a party that serves New Zealanders, some of whom voted accordingly.

To those of you that had that brilliant epiphany on election day and smile when they think of NZ First back in parliament. Thankyou.

We are a growing party strong in our beliefs and to all 147,544 people who entrusted us with their votes – we will represent the beliefs that you hold as vital to the prosperous future of our nation.

Beliefs that are the founding principles of our party:

To put New Zealand and New Zealanders First and to have an open accountable Government.

We believe in one law for all New Zealanders regardless of race, age or colour.

A country that belongs to all New Zealanders, not foreign boardrooms whose only interest is a quarterly financial statement.

I believe in wealth creation through a sound and practical long term economic plan, with short term key performance indicators to make sure we are on track.

This NZ First economic plan will operate in the absence of secrecy.

These beliefs are not new to New Zealanders.

In fact here is a quote from one of the great former leaders of our country.

“I believe in New Zealanders owning their own industry, all industry, wherever practicable… This country is growing up, and I want it to see it owned and controlled by New Zealanders in every possible sphere.

There is, of course, also an economic reason – the bleeding away of overseas funds and the paying of tribute to people overseas…. I, for one, want to see New Zealand mature, to grow up in its own sense, have its own soul, develop its own character, and have control of its own destiny in all spheres of the economy…….This is my simple faith”.

And that was said by none other than former National Prime Minister Sir Keith Holyoake. What would he think of our country today? How will history view us in 20 years time?

Mr Speaker – I live in Tauranga – well actually my family live there and I am now bi-regional by vocation.

On top of the many challenges that we face in NZ, Tauranga has the added burden of the Rena and its effect not only on our environment but also the economic damage to businesses both small and large, and the long term effects that have yet be fully realised.

Another major concern is the PSA virus that has wiped out over half the golden kiwifruit crop, and that equates to close to $500 million dollars out of the Tauranga and Bay of Plenty economy.

The disease is having an impact across the entire industry, from individual growers, contractors, seasonal workers to Zespri.

All levels of the industry are having to change and adapt their businesses to survive.

Promisingly, there is a pathway out of the PSA damage emerging, based around a new variety known as Gold 3.

I believe with time and government support our industry can recover.

I believe that Tauranga has the potential to be a great city!

The best in the world.

And to those people in Tauranga – you will understand this vision.

Imagine if we built a 25,000 seat stadium at The Domain – above the CBD.

If we constructed a walkway around our stunning harbour.

Can you envision the potential of fast passenger rail from Auckland in under 2 hours?

And what about if we cleaned up our water and marketed ourselves as the cleanest city in the world.

What a vibrant, exciting metropolis we could become.

Any one of these projects would provide the opportunity for on-the-job apprentice-ships and long term employment.

Mr Speaker, I believe that as a country – it is time we believed in ourselves.

I believe our most important asset is our people and we must invest in New Zealanders in health, education and emerging skills and competencies.

The world is now immersed in a mobile digital revolution.

NZ is justifiably proud of its pioneering tradition.

At times we have led the world on everything from nuclear physics to powered flight to climbing the highest mountain.

Our people are some of the most creative, innovative and forward thinking to be found anywhere.

But currently we are marking time and quite frankly we need to embrace, support and speed up the rollout of ultra fast broadband.

The mobile digital revolution is accelerating at an exponential rate.

Countries with established broadband are rapidly going mobile and that is going to have massive implications for business, education and the health sector.

The last quarter of 2011 the number of smart phones purchased surpassed the combined number of pc’s,laptops, ipads and tablets sold.

Hand held computing is here to stay and the high powered browser enabled high definition video ready device is already revolutionizing the way businesses market, trade and do commerce, the way people learn and educate, the way health services and care giving are provided and growing the way we communicate in politics – if only we could get reception in the 75 metres between the Beehive and Bowen House!

These services are now operating in an always connected world.

The up skilling with new skills and competencies in New Zealand’s workforce is a priority.

It is my intention to see that the professional development required happens

It is our choice and our opportunity to catch this wave rather than to let it swamp us or pass us by.

Far be it from me to give hints on sartorial elegance. I could learn from some here and not from others.

If I may explain the ochre I display on my tie today.

It symbolizes the blood sweat and tears that our forefathers have invested in this land.

The green represents fertility, growth, promise and the hope for a better tomorrow.

We once led the world in social and economic standing and by working together I believe we can do so again.

My pledge to all New Zealanders is that I will strive with integrity to combine the safety and standards of my childhood with the digital - forward thinking, economic ownership, and environmental consciousness of this generation.

I will work with any other member or party supporting ideas that are good for New Zealand and oppose those that would do us harm.

This is what I believe in and what I intend to do.

My final acknowledgement I give to my wife for she holds my heart.
