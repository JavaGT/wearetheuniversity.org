Free Zaoui For The Next Flight - Peters

Free Zaoui For The Next Flight - Peters

Rt Hon Winston Peters is calling for the release of so-called refugee Ahmed Zaoui from Paremoremo prison if it is causing mental health problems and asking that he be sent back to where he came from to New Zealand.

Mr Peters said that Zaoui could end his suffering from psychological problems by applying to return to Malaysia and he was sure that New Zealand taxpayers would be willing to pay his airfare.

“It is puzzling why Zaoui came to New Zealand to seek asylum when there are many Islamic countries he could have gone to. We are a nominally Christian country and are therefore infidels in the eyes of fundamentalist Muslims.

“It would be best for everyone, Zaoui included, if he returned overseas to a society he felt comfortable in. It is difficult to understand how he could be assimilated here – especially when he has been linked to groups that no one in their right mind would want within their country’s borders.”

Mr Peters also questioned the costs of the hospitality extended to the Algerian and asked whether the Government was going to pay the costs of all his witnesses and supporters coming to New Zealand for a hearing next month.

“Thousands of New Zealanders who paid taxes all their lives can’t get adequate healthcare but the Government is prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on an individual who came here on false papers with a dubious story.

“Get your priorities right Prime Minister,” urged Mr Peters.
