What Is Causing The Depression?

New Zealand First social services spokesperson Bill Gudgeon is urging the Government to find out why the country is full of stressed out and depressed people.

This follows the release of new figures showing a 101 percent increase in stress and depression over the last eight years.

“Stress and depression have been identified as the leading reasons behind the increase in the number of people claiming sickness or invalid benefits,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“Severe back pain was once the prime contributor to numbers on the sickness and invalid’s benefit. Now we’re facing a higher incidence of mental health issues preventing people from joining the workforce.

“The Minister, Steve Maharey, may claim that the growth in the number of people on disability-related benefits was a trend experienced by most OECD nations, but he should be asking himself why so many Kiwis are depressed and stressed out.

“It could well be that the Government only has themselves to blame. Unaffordable housing, rising student debt, rising costs, increased power prices and a worsening law and order situation are enough to make anyone depressed,” Mr Gudgeon concluded.
