Government Spends $831,000 On Maori-Made Logo
=============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters has released evidence showing that the Government intends to spend $831,000 on the ‘Maori-made’ logo.

An answer to a written question Judith Tizard said that The Government has already spent over $570,000, including $100,000 for two huis, $35,000 for legal fees and $150,000 for promotional materials. It also plans to spend $350,000 per annum to renew the logo.

“This is Political Correctness on a gross scale. At a time when schools and hospitals are being asked to tighten their belts the Government has spent this obscene amount on a logo that will do nothing to improve the lot of Maori, “ said Mr Peters.

“ The amount spent is made even more bitter by the fact that recent legislation means the copyright for the logo will not be able to be enforced anyway.

“ I am calling on the Prime Minister, who is also Minister of Arts and Culture to veto this wreckless spending.

“When Labour was last in power they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a ‘Miha’ label that had all the levitation of a lead balloon,” concluded Mr Peters.
