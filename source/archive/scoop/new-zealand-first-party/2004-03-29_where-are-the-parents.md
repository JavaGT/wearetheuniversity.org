Where Are The Parents?

New Zealand First is asking what has happened to the responsibility of families after the revelation that CYFS had over 5000 cases of child abuse waiting to be allocated to workers.

“New Zealand is supposed to be a first world country, yet we have thousands of cases of child abuse that are unallocated,” said social services spokesperson Bill Gudgeon.

“Of those 15 cases were critical, 24 very urgent, 3421 urgent and 1871 of low urgency.

“Where are the parents in all of this? What has happened to New Zealand that child abuse has reached such high levels?

“New Zealand seems to have lost the culture of strong family ties. Why are families no longer taking responsibility and giving children a safe, loving environment to grow up in?

“We cannot blame CFYS for this, this is another example of a society that has lost its value system. It is time for people to take responsibility and stop the abuse,” said Mr Gudgeon.
