ANZAC Cove In Jeopardy Says Gudgeon

New Zealand First veterans’ affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon is calling on the Turkish government to act immediately and put a stop to damaging construction works at Anzac Cove after reports suggest that soldiers’ graves may have been dug up in the process.

Mr Gudgeon expressed his concern last week over the damage excavation was causing to the historical site after seeing photos of parts of Anzac Cove beach and the area above the cove, which were virtually unrecognisable.

“As a designated National Park it is debatable as to whether any construction work on this kind of scale should be undertaken at all. “Anzac Cove is a sacred site and all efforts should be made to ensure its preservation. Any construction work must be undertaken with great care and with regard for the historical significance of the site,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“It is important that people are able to gather at the cove and commemorate the thousands of men who lost their lives in battle, but hastily widening the road to attract more tourists places its preservation in jeopardy.

“We know the Turkish authorities place great importance on the site and will act to stop any unwitting desecration,” concluded Mr Gudgeon.
