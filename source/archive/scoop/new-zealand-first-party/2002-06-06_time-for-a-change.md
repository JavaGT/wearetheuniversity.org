Media Release

Time For A Change

“New Zealand’s secondary students continue to suffer interruptions to their programmes while their over-worked teachers consider an inadequate offer from a Government out of touch with the education sector,” New Zealand First education spokesman Brian Donnelly said.

“New Zealand First believes that education is a critical social and economic investment and that our teachers should be in the class room. Whilst acknowledging that there are workload and other issues that need resolution we urge an early settlement of the current dispute.

“In the next Government New Zealand First will give priority to the introduction of a new system for the establishment of teachers’ pay and conditions which will ensure New Zealand maintains the best quality teaching force in the world but under which our children do not lose educational time through teacher strikes”.
