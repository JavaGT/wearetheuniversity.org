Whānau Ora ‘Bro-Psychobabble’ Funding At $12m and Counting

**Whānau Ora ‘Bro-Psychobabble’ Funding At $12 Million – And Counting**

New Zealand First is asking the Government to explain how it can tax paper boys while the Māori Party wastes $12 million to finance what amounts to Whānau Ora ‘mumbo jumbo’.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says more outrageous Whānau Ora bro-ocracy funding decisions are being uncovered by the day.

“A family was given $4500 to ‘develop a strategy to promote who they are’ and strengthen connections to each other.

“Another family was handed $5000 to take control of their lives and move out of the ‘status quo lifestyle’.

“And then there’s the ludicrous funding of $5000 so a family can create a plan that ‘weaves the strands of whānau together with a collective goal of reconnection’.”

Mr Peters says this is just the start of Whānau Ora funding which unless scrapped by the Government will potentially cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

“Funding has so far largely been used to feed the creation of the so-called ‘whānau plans’ which in essence are used for getting more money out of the system.

“Soon the people behind these plans will be back asking for more Government funding to implement them.

“This has clearly been dreamt up in a sociology department of some second-rate university,” says Mr Peters.
