Thousands of Local Government Jobs to Go – NZ First

New Zealand First is forecasting thousands of job losses in local government as a result of the National Government’s damaging austerity measures.

Local Government spokesperson Andrew Williams says job cuts announced at Wellington City Council (WCC) are directly linked to central Government’s misguided vision that putting up the economic shutters will somehow improve the economy.

“Change managers have been working within WCC for a number of weeks as they look at slashing employee numbers including senior managers.

“By some counts as many as 200 employees in WCC could be made redundant.”

Mr Williams says the austerity being dished out by National ensures other local bodies around the country will also look to slash jobs.

“It will simply force thousands of Kiwi workers to join the dole queue or see them take flight and find work in Australia.

“So much for National’s promise of a brighter future,” says Mr Williams.
