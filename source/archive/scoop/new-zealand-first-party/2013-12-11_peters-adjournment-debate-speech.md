Peters: Adjournment Debate Speech
=================================

**Wednesday, 11 December 2013, 5:03 pm**  
**Speech: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

  
**Rt Hon Winston Peters**  
New Zealand First Leader  
11 December 2013  

**Adjournment Debate Speech  
Wednesday 11 December 2013**  
**Parliament Buildings**

On behalf of New Zealand First we want to thank all of the many people who make Parliament function effectively

Their commitment, integrity, and professionalism ensure that the New Zealand Parliament runs in a smooth way.

There are a lot of people to acknowledge - the Speaker’s office, the Clerk’s Office, the Hansard reporters, all the library staff, and the telephonists.

We appreciate the cheerful messengers and security staff for their hard work in keeping us all safe (and under control)

And, of course the cleaners. They deserve a special thanks—and a pay rise.

And if we have overlooked anybody, our apologies.

We want to acknowledge the support and dedication of NZ First staff who have helped make us such an effective team in serving the public .

However it’s harder to be kind to the people over there who are doing a runner after spending another year wrecking the place.

They don’t want to face scrutiny for a nano-second longer.

It’s been a great year for their cronies but more kicks in the teeth for ordinary people.

Never before in the history of human endeavour has so little been done for so many - for the benefit of so few.

Let’s list some of those non-achievers non-achievements:

• The dream of owning your own home – Just about gone  
• High performing state assets like power stations – just about gone  
• Public broadcasting – just about gone  
• Job opportunities for young – just about gone  
• Our manufacturing industry – just about gone.  
• Our best dairying farmland – just about gone.  
• The foreshore and seabed – just about gone  
• The member for Epsom – just about gone – to court first  
• The leaker for Ohariu – he’s just about gone  
• The member for Warner brothers, Sky City, Rio Tinto – just about gone – following his memory which was gone a long time ago.  
• Our friends in the Maori Party – just about gone  
• In fact this is the most “just about gone” government in history.  
Somebody should have told “the just about gone” brigade they don’t actually own New Zealand.

This country is not “The National Party and Limpets Limited”.

It actually belongs to the people and the leaders are supposed to be guardians.

This lot guard only their mates pockets and foreign companies.

Ordinary kiwis are not considered.

This country is losing jobs at an alarming rate – so what do the political pygmies do?

Give what jobs there are to foreigners.

What about bringing in tens of thousands of foreign students to study here – then giving them work visas!

How dumb is that!

And what about giving Full New Zealand pensions to people who have been here only ten years?

What other country has a leadership this stupid?  
The ghost of Ebeneezer Scrooge stalks the corridors of the callous.

This Government has brought ordinary Kiwis no Xmas Cheer and the Scrooges will have no change of heart.

We in New Zealand First try to bring a message of hope – that this country can be a better place.

There are some of us who remember that New Zealand once tried to be fair and to look after its people – especially the young and the old.

Let me assure you we will be back fresher, faster, fearless and more ferocious next year to hold the government to account.

This is a fair warning.

But finally let me say New Zealand First is the party of traditional values.

We wish all New Zealanders a Happy Xmas and a very good New Year!

**ENDS**
