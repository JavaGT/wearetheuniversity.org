Bulldozers Not the Answer for Closed Rural Schools

**Bulldozers Not the Answer for Closed Rural Schools**

Statements by Ministry of Education officials over the recent demolition of Waikato’s Kereone School buildings, pool and tennis courts are questionable,” says New Zealand First.

“In the last 18 months swimming pools have been bulldozed at least at two other closed schools. They were community funded and community built,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“All three of these communities were not notified.

“The Ministry’s claim that it is ‘usual practice’ to demolish closed schools and clear the sites when they are being disposed of does not match with previous practice.

“Once a school is up for disposal, it must first be assessed for any possible treaty settlement before being offered back to the original owners for purchase.

“Associate Minister Nikki Kaye, who has responsibility for schools that have been closed, needs to answer some questions.

“Kereone School had been the focal point for its rural community for over 90 years. Any opportunity to continue using the school buildings, pool and tennis courts has gone.

“Let’s hope bringing in the bulldozers isn’t going to become the norm for schools that have been closed in small communities,” says Mrs Martin.
