Stop transfer of water consents
===============================

**STOP TRANSFER OF WATER CONSENTS**

New Zealand First wants the transferring of water consents to stop when the original reason for gaining the consent ceases.

“It’s appalling that businesses that have been allocated a quantity of water, but no longer need it, are selling it off at huge profit,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“According to [an article by Newsroom](http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/91957274/when-the-river-runs-dry-the-true-cost-of-nz-water), sales range from $50,000 to $500,000 and Environment Canterbury has transferred 494 water permits between properties in a decade, 290 of those in the last five years.

“Councils do not receive any payment they just transfer the ownership.

“The National government has claimed no one owns the water, but clearly that’s not the case and big money is changing hands.

“According to the article, water users sometimes discover efficiencies so no longer need all the water they applied to use, or they do not build as much irrigation infrastructure as planned.

“The public is already concerned about water exports and nothing being paid by large corporates to take and sell the water.

“Royalties should be placed on water extraction for export and at least 25 per cent should go to the region from where it is taken.

“There is concern about pollution of our waterways, both in rural areas and towns and cities. With trading in water now a profitable business there is lack of control of water takes and use,” says Mr Peters.
