Mama And Pepi Packs Deserve National Roll Out  

New Zealand First welcomes the Waikato District Health Board’s decision to fund Mama and Pepi (baby) Packs for expectant mothers and believes such an initiative should be adopted throughout New Zealand.

“This is fantastic and will help Waikato newborns begin their lives happy and healthy,” says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“For 75 years Finland has been gifting similar packs to mothers and remains a world leader in low infant mortality rates.

“The packs contain vital items to ensure new mothers have everything necessary, including baby clothes, nappies, and bathing products.

“New Zealand First would love to see packs delivered nationally as all New Zealand babies deserve to enter this world with an equal opportunity to thrive,” says Mrs Stewart.
