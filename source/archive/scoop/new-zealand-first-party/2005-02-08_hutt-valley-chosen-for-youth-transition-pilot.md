Hutt Valley Chosen For Youth Transition Service Pilot

The Hutt Valley has been selected as one of the next five sites for the roll-out of the Youth Transition Service.

The Youth Transition Service, funded and co-ordinated through the Ministry of Social Development and implemented in partnership with the Mayors Taskforce for Jobs, provides funding for regional programmes that:

\- Provide at risk youth with access to career planning and job-seeking help  
\- Encourage and assist youth to take advantage of education and training opportunities  
\- Provide school-leavers with customised support and guidance to facilitate their pathway into work, education or training.

"This is a very exciting initiative for us to be involved with. It'll ensure young people don't fall through the cracks after leaving school and that they feel they have a place in the Valley." said Mayors David Ogden and Wayne Guppy.

"The Mayors Taskforce for Jobs has been working in this area for some time and we believe being chosen as one of the pilot sites is the Government's recognition of that work."

There is a need for young people to experience a smooth transition from school to further education, training or work. It is estimated that up to 45,000 15 to 19 year-olds do not enrol in tertiary study or get a job after leaving school. The Youth Transition Service is part of the government's $56.9 million package that will make sure young people become productive members of their communities.

"We are keen to continue providing opportunities for young people in the Valley. We have found working in partnership with government agencies, community groups and businesses very successful and the most effective use of resources.

"In partnership with Work and Income we have implemented Job Track, which is a service providing advice and support to young school leavers to help them establish a career path." said Mayor Ogden.

Both Hutt City and Upper Hutt City Councils are also participating in a Cadet Scheme giving young people valuable work experience at the Councils for 12 months."

"We are in the process of developing an Apprenticeship Information Service and we're also involved in a Wainuiomata Pilot Project" said Mayor Ogden.

"The government has set an ambitious target - to make sure all 15-19 year olds are in work, education, or training by 2007" said Mike Bryant, Regional Commissioner, Work and Income.

"The $7.9 million expansion of the Youth Transition Service into five new areas represents significant progress towards this goal. Work and Income looks forward to working with both councils on the pilot."

The other Youth Transition Service pilot sites are Manukau, Hamilton, Gisborne, and the Far North.

Councils will have a key facilitation and consultation role. Details of the pilot are yet to be finalised but it is expected it will be running in time for the end of school this year.
