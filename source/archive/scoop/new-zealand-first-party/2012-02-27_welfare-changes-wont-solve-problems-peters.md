Welfare Changes Wont Solve Problems – Peters

**Welfare Changes Wont Solve Problems – Peters**

Rt Hon Winston Peters says the welfare changes announced today are feeble and amount to “whistling in the wind” because they do nothing to improve the economy or create jobs.

“When state-owned companies like Air New Zealand outsource jobs to China and the government itself plans to create overseas call centres rather than employ New Zealanders, you know they don’t care about Kiwis.

“Since this government took office in 2008 an extra 65,000 people have gone on benefits.

“National has been acting like the ‘international’ party and have sent thousands of local jobs offshore.

“The prime minister’s statement that people must be ‘work available’ is nonsense in a country where hundreds of job losses are announced every week.

“The new measures have been designed by rich people to keep the poor and downtrodden in their place at the bottom of the heap,” says Mr Peters.
