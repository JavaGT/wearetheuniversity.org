Media Release

Want Attention? Light Fires

New Zealand First Education spokesperson Brian Donnelly has today described flag burner Paul Hopkinson as an attention-seeking idiot who should not appear in front of a classroom again.

Hopkinson has already been arrested once and went through our justice system at considerable expense. Now he has deliberately provoked public outrage by repeating his actions.

“This man is clearly not fit to teach our children. School fires are a plague in this country and by his dim-witted actions Hopkinson is virtually encouraging children to use fire as a means of venting their feelings,” said Mr Donnelly

“Thousands of New Zealanders gave their lives on overseas battlegrounds and the New Zealand flag is a symbol of what they died for.

“New Zealanders will be disgusted at this mans actions and they certainly wont want him teaching their kids his odious principles of expression by incineration,“ said Mr Donnelly.
