Budget: Cynically Playing Smoke And Mirrors With Education

**Budget 2016: Cynically Playing Smoke And Mirrors With Education**

The government is cynically attempting to bamboozle New Zealand educators and parents by moving figures around like a school gala game in its 2016 “Get-Stuffed Budget”, but it won’t work,” says New Zealand First.

“One example is a cut of close to $2.5 million from providing resources and support for teachers,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“Another is slashing $7 million from the Curriculum Support budget which provides supplementary programmes.

“But most concerning is the axing by the National Government of over $6 million for professional development and support to early childhood education services and schools.

“This is a complete sell-out.

“Basically what the government has told teachers, parents and students who want the New Zealand education system to become the best in the world again, is to ‘get stuffed’,” Mrs Martin says.
