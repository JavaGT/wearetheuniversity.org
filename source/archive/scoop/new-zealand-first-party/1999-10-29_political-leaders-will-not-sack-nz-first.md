Political Leaders Will Not Sack NZ First
========================================

**Friday, 29 October 1999, 1:21 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

The New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters, has warned Mrs Shipley that neither she, nor any other political leader, will be given the chance to fire any New Zealand First MP from any post ever again.

He said that in future only the voters will decide the fate of New Zealand First MPs and he and his MPs will always live with the voters’ verdicts.

Mr Peters told a Greypower meeting on Auckland’s North Shore this afternoon that it was time to correct the mistaken impression that Mrs Shipley was spreading about their coalition relationship.

“It is the height of arrogance for her to make out that she is some kind of strong leader telling people what to do and where to go.

“In point of fact, she only became Prime Minister because she gave her word over a number issues then promptly broke it by selling State assets to foreign ownership, changing tariff regimes, and then attacking the elderly and students.

“That is why the coalition ended and that is why it is no use her running around pretending that we are friends waiting to help her.

“It is the height of arrogance for politicians to start making decisions and announcements about who will govern, and in what capacity.

“That decision will be made by over two million New Zealanders on the 27th November,” said Mr Peters.
