Joyce Passing Buck Over Foreign Students
========================================

**Tuesday, 20 September 2016, 4:48 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**Rt Hon Winston Peters**

New Zealand First Leader

Member of Parliament for Northland  
20 SEPTEMBER 2016  

**Joyce Passing Buck Over Foreign Students**

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce only has his eyes on the dollars and is not interested in regulating New Zealand’s international student industry, says New Zealand First.

“Thousands of international students are arriving here with false visas and all Mr Joyce is saying – it’s not our responsibility, it’s the education businesses.

“He’s happy for the National government to take millions of dollars from the industry but won’t police it; instead he says a code of practice is being drawn up to make providers responsible for the behaviour of agents.

“It is a classic case of passing the buck, and what happens if the education providers are as bad as the crooked agents?

“It is a well-established fact, New Zealand is at the low end of the international student education market and is being used by most foreign students as a fast track, not to gain a higher education, but to get permanent residency.

“All Mr Joyce is worried about is not disrupting the flow of students to this country, regardless of how shonky the whole business is,” Mr Peters says.
