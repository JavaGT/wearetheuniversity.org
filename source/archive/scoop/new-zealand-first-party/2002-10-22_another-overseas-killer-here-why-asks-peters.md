Another Overseas Killer Here – Why? Asks Peters

New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters has called on the Immigration Minister to explain why yet another convicted killer from overseas was allowed into New Zealand earlier this year and has still not been found.

Ropati Nauer , 29, slipped border controls when he arrived in Auckland in January. He is wanted by Samoan authorities after skipping bail while awaiting sentencing for manslaughter. New Zealand police describe him as dangerous.

Mr Peters said Nauer was the third killer to be allowed into New Zealand this year by a “slack and dysfunctional” Immigration Service, which appeared to have scant regard for the safety of New Zealanders.

“The Minister should explain why these overseas killers are let loose among the population and in the Nauer case, for a period of ten months. People are starting to wonder whether this Government has any border controls in place.

“There is no doubt the Immigration Service cannot police our borders while it is swamped with processing the tens of thousands of Third World immigrants the Government keeps welcoming to our shores.”

Mr Peters said that during the debate on the anti-terrorism legislation, Ministers from the Prime Minister down gave all sorts of assurances that our borders were safe, but the fact that three killers were allowed in this year showed that nothing had been done since September 11.

“Their words were worth nothing. We are heading for a fall and New Zealanders will suffer,” warned Mr Peters.
