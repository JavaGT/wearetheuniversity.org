Government Truancy Service Failing Schools

**Government Truancy Service Failing Schools**

New Zealand First has again warned that the Government’s truancy service, Integrated Attendance Service (IAS), is failing students and their schools.

Information received under the OIA shows serious problems with both the contracts and the capacity of the providers to deliver them.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the IAS is too remote, non-responsive, and schools can wait weeks for a truancy adviser to show up.

The Ministry of Education increased funding from $5.8 million to $9 million in the 2012/2013 Budget, saying that schools should expect improved services but that is simply not the case.

“Some IAS providers say the goals within their contracts are unrealistic and they are unable to meet some of their KPI’s (key performance indicators.)

“Schools are saying the time delay between their first contact with IAS and any action being taken over an absent student is frustratingly long. They also report that the administration required is complex, time consuming and difficult to manage.

“Truancy officers need to have a relationship with the families of at risk children but the IAS workers often don’t even have a relationship with the school they are working for. Schools are often not kept in the loop with what has happened once they have lodged a referral with the IAS.

“Unless there is an immediate remedy to this situation, schools will be forced to find their own solutions and will become increasingly reluctant to use this government service.

“The contract model is not working for schools and the IAS will end up being just like Novopay - a distraction keeping schools from the business of educating our children,” says Ms Martin.
