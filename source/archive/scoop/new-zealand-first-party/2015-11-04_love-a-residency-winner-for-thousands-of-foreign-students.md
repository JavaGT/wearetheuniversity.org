**‘Love’ a Residency Winner for Thousands of Foreign Students**

  
Partnership has become an immigration backdoor for foreign students obtaining permanent residency in New Zealand, says New Zealand First.

Since 2008 we have granted residency to 14,204 foreign students on the basis of partnership, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The number who have found love and stayed exceeds the populations of Kaikohe, Dargaville and Kerikeri,” says Mr Peters.

“Immigration New Zealand approves over 95 per cent of all applications. It’s doubtful that Immigration staff visit and interview every one of the over two thousand applicants a year to check if they are bona fide.

“Many applicants know that Immigration does not have the resources to check. New Zealand First is calling for tighter policy and greater resources to verify applicants’ credentials.

“Outside of this partnership backdoor, 47,208 foreign students have been granted residence.

“China and India account for 58 per cent of the figure. That’s almost equal to the population of Invercargill. National has lost control of immigration policy,” says Mr Peters.
