Minister Turns The Lights Out On Turakina
=========================================

Spokesperson for Education

**MINISTER TURNS THE LIGHTS OUT ON TURAKINA**

The closure of Turakina Māori Girls’ College, in Marton, by Education Minister Hekia Parata is a devastating blow to students, staff and alumni who stood in the rain at Parliament in September, begging the government to save their school, says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“It’s heartless. At the very least Turakina’s Board of Trustees hoped the Minister would put off announcing her decision till students had finished their final exams on December 3.

“We also understand that as recently as Monday the school was still having discussions with the Presbyterian Church around a business plan to save the school. The church, along with the Minister, could have done more.

“How can the Minister say she believes in Māori Education and yet refuse to work constructively with Turakina?

“The government has turned its back on an iconic Māori Girls’ College, which offers no reassurance for Hato Petera College which faces the same fate.

“The Minister was nowhere to be seen when Parliament’s Speaker refused Turakina protestors entry into Parliament in September, leaving them in the pouring rain. She did not back them then and nothing has changed.

“This is a sad day for Māori education,” says Mrs Martin.
