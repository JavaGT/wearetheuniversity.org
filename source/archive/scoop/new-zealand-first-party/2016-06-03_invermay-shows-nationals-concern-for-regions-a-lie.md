Invermay Shows National’s Concern for Regions a Lie

Invermay Shows National’s Concern for Regions a Lie

The government signing off 199 AgResearch jobs from Invermay to other parts of the country is a harsh blow for Otago and a complete contradiction of its supposed support for regions, says New Zealand First.

“The government keeps telling us time and again that it supports the regions and our primary producers – what a farce,” says Primary Industries spokesperson Richard Prosser.

“The reality of Crown Research agencies is that they are located where they are needed.

“If the government showed any honesty and lived up to their so-called policy of supporting regions, they would have made sure Invermay was kept at full strength and staff retained there,” says Mr Prosser.
