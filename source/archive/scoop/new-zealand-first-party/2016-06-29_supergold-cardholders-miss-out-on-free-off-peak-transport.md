Supergold Cardholders Miss Out on Free Off-Peak Transport

Supergold Cardholders Will Miss Out on Free Off-Peak Transport

Thousands of SuperGold Card users will be shut out of free off-peak public transport in Auckland with the switch to the Auckland Transport Gold HOP card, says New Zealand First.

“The confused, long-winded changeover is excluding thousands – this is just what the government wants,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The fewer people using their SuperGold Card concession, the less it costs the government.

“The change to the HOP card by July 1 has been a mess from the start, and is sidelining tens of thousands of people who have been confused by the lack of information and the many changes in the process.

“The requirement for photo ID was eventually dumped. Thousands were signed on to a new blue HOP card, then it was dropped for a gold-coloured card. Little direct information went to cardholders and Auckland Transport is now chasing Seniors all over the city with a mobile unit.

“Instead of one SuperGold Card to get on a bus, train or ferry there will be Seniors lining up with SuperGold Cards, blue HOP cards and gold HOP cards. What a muddle.

“Even if they use public transport only twice a year SuperGold Cardholders are entitled to free off-peak transport, but right now many will miss out,” says Mr Peters.
