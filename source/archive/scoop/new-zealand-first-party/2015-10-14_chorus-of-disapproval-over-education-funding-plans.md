Chorus of Disapproval Over Education Funding Plans

Tracey Martin MP

Spokesperson for Education

Chorus of Disapproval Over Education Funding Plans Rising in the North

“New Zealand First joins Northland principals and other educational professionals in rejecting the funding of schools based on academic outcomes which we believe will be a disaster for students,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“We all know that the decile rating system works for no one at the moment but for Education Minister Hekia Parata to come up with this failed system behind closed doors without real sector input just beggars belief.”

Mrs Martin says it’s right up there with the “class size doesn’t matter” decision the Minister made and then had to retract.

“Northland principals are worried that in some areas of the region, many of their students are already on the back foot when it comes to arriving at school prepared for learning. The Minister’s suggested model linking school funding to student achievement will only worsen the situation.

“New Zealand First made the commitment in its 2014 Manifesto to work with the sector to develop funding and resourcing models to best meet the needs of all children,” says Mrs Martin.

“And when New Zealand First talks about ‘all children’ we mean all children, including those that need academic support or academic extension to reach their personal best.

“With so many voices in Northland expressing serious concern about proposed funding changes, it’s time the Minister listened before ploughing into yet another misguided policy,” says Mrs Martin.
