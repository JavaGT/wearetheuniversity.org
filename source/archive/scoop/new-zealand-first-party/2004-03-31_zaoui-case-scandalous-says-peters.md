Zaoui Case Scandalous Says Peters

New Zealand has just made itself the laughing stock of the Western World because of the unwanted convicted terrorist Ahmed Zaoui, Rt Hon Winston Peters claimed today.

He was responding to a High Court ruling that the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, Laurie Greig, showed apparent bias in comments he made about Zaoui, and should stand aside from a review of the case.

Mr Peters said the ruling meant that Zaoui, who was removed from France, Switzerland and Belgium for gravely serious offences, had successfully challenged the top security official in New Zealand at the taxpayers’ expense.

“This is an outrageous state of affairs. Zaoui has been mistakenly allowed to stay here by a Refugee Status Appeal Authority ruling which is in direct contradiction to the 1951 UN convention that refuge cannot be sought if a crime has been committed elsewhere.

“Zaoui has been convicted for a number of offences in Europe and this means the RSAA was simply wrong at the expense of New Zealand taxpayers to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“This individual should be out of here on the next plane. Look at Bali and Spain. New Zealanders should come first – not some dangerous import, “ said Mr Peters.
