Alliance Education Campaign Hypocritical
========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

2nd March 2001

  
ALLIANCE EDUCATION CAMPAIGN HYPOCRITICAL  
CLAIMS NEW ZEALAND FIRST

  
“The public campaign by the Alliance to re-introduce the unemployment benefit for students during holidays is the extreme of hypocrisy” said New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly MP.

Last year Greens MP, Sue Bradford, introduced legislation to bring back the EUB. Alliance Caucus members voted as a block against this legislation. In fact, New Zealand First was the only other party in Parliament to support this legislation.

“It is a bit rich for the Alliance Education Spokesperson, Hon Liz Gordon, to be making impassioned speeches extolling the policy when last year she and her colleagues voted against it.

The public only has to read Hansard to judge the degree of hypocrisy of the Alliance party over this issue,” said Mr Donnelly.
