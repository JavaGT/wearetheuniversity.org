Length Of Training Debate Masks The Real Issue - Donnelly

“Debate over the relative value of different teacher training programmes based on the number of years required mask the real issues,” says NZ First MP, Brian Donnelly.

“Surely the question should be about what knowledge and skills graduand teachers must have to successfully do the job”.

“During my time as an area school principal, I had a Home Economics teacher who had a degree in French and German. Her salary reflected her graduate status, not the knowledge she brought to the job”.

“Research undertaken by the Auckland College of Education showed that first year teachers graduates of the three year degree programme were better prepared for the classroom than those with the four year degree”.

“If courses can be structured so that within three years students can gain the same knowledge and skills as those in courses structured over four years, then we should not be getting into silly arguments over the relative merit of those courses”.

“With the heavy burden of student debt the concentration of courses with no loss of outcome quality are to be encouraged,” says Brian Donnelly.
