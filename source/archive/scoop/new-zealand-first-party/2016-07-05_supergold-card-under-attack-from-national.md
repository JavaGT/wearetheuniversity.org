Supergold Card under Attack From National
=========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland

Supergold Card under Attack From National

  
The government insisting SuperGold Cardholders have to buy smartcards to travel free on public transport at off-peak times is a move towards undermining the value of the card, New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters said when accepting a Grey Power petition at Parliament today.

“It is unfair and wrong that after seniors have paid a lifetime of taxes, this government wants to chip away and ultimately destroy what the SuperGold Card is all about.

“By capping funding to councils for seniors’ free off-peak travel, it will be only a matter of time before the councils and transport operators say the scheme is too expensive.

“That is why this petition started at Tauranga Grey Power is so important – it tells the government not to mess with the SuperGold Card and to ensure adequate funding is made available for seniors to travel free on public transportation during off-peak periods.

“Free off-peak travel has added to the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of seniors, helping them to remain active and engaged in their communities; it must be maintained,” Mr Peters said.  

The petition states:  
“We the undersigned, respectfully request that the House of Representatives examine the capped bulk funding model to ensure SuperGold Card free off-peak public transport scheme is adequately funded and appropriately resourced by central government”.

  
ENDS
