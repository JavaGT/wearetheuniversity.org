Tranzrail Off The Rails On Safety, Says Mark

Tranzrail is shirking its responsibility by failing to address residents’ concerns regarding a north Canterbury level crossing, says New Zealand First MP Ron Mark.

“The Fernside Road crossing in Rangiora has been the site of four collisions in recent years and after hearing concerns raised by residents I think it’s obvious that safety improvements are needed,” says Mr Mark.

“Tranzrail’s reported comment that they are not solely responsible for upgrading crossings is unacceptable.

“I am extremely concerned to read newspaper articles of disagreements between Tranzrail and various authorities over who is responsible to fund and install improvements to level crossings,” said Mr Mark.

“I will be seeking meetings with Tranzrail and Transit New Zealand to see what can be done before Fernside Road is the scene of another preventable accident,” said Mr Mark.
