"Is PPTA Racist?" - Asks NZ First MP

“The Post-Primary Teachers Association has called for a cap on the numbers of foreign-fee paying students in secondary schools.

“Is this the PPTA being racist?”, asks NZ First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“Of course it isn’t. It is a sensible suggestion at a time that our country is desperate for secondary teachers. To label PPTA as racist would be as rattle-brained as those critics of NZ First which label us as racist for calling for a limitation of immigration numbers.

“The area of foreign-fee paying students in our schools which are first and foremost there to serve NZ students is an area where there is a desperate need for clear policy. NZ First supports the PPTA recommendation as an interim measure while that work is being done,” said Mr Donnelly.

“It is to be noted that the numbers of such students have leapt from 4128 in 1999 to 9498 in 2002, during a period when secondary schools have been hit by the population bulge”.
