Auckland University World Leader

New Zealand First says Auckland University should be congratulated on its far-sighted understanding of student and community needs.

“The new School of Population Health at Tamaki is an innovative development that will benefit academics, students and the community,” said associate education spokesperson Jim Peters.

“The concept of combining teaching, research and practice is to be commended, and is an exciting indicator of the possibilities open to universities. It also opens up opportunities for students to engage in research in a stimulating environment that also presents career opportunities.

“Auckland University deserves recognition as a world-class university that is leading the way in visionary strategies for education in the 21st century.

“New Zealand First applauds this move, and also recognises the flow-on benefits to Auckland that will result from this co-operative venture that involves the private sector and the community,” said Mr Peters.
