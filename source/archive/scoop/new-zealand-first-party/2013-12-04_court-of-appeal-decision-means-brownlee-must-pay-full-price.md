Court of Appeal Decision Means Brownlee Must Pay Full Price

The Court of Appeal judgement that the Government’s 50 per cent offer to bare land owners and uninsured property owners in Christchurch’s red zone was illegal, vindicates the Quake Outcast’s position and their refusal to accept the offer says New Zealand First Spokesperson for earthquake issues Denis O’Rourke.

The rights of uninsured property owners have been trampled on, and they have been the subject of unlawful discrimination when other red zone property owners have received government offers of 100 per cent of the 2007 rating value.

“It is high time for Minister Brownlee to review his inexplicable decision to offer only 50% of the 2007 rating value, which was clearly inconsistent with the purpose of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act.

“The only fair and rational conclusion must be for the Government’s offer to be increased to 100% of the 2007 rating value, just as was made to other red zoned home owners.

“New Zealand First has consistently called for an immediate end to this unseemly and unfair charade.

“The right thing to do now is for the Government to offer full value forthwith to the red zoners who refused the 50 per cent offer, and to pay the deficit to the people who had been bullied into accepting only 50 per cent in the first place,” says Mr O’Rourke.
