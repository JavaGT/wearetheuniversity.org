Barriers to Salisbury School enrolment must come down

**Barriers to Salisbury School enrolment must come down**

New Zealand First is calling on the government to allow parents to enrol their children directly at Salisbury School for high needs girls in Richmond, Nelson.

“The government removed the school’s ability to take applications and dramatically reduced the numbers they can take,” says New Zealand First Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“The government put enrolments in the hands of the Ministry of Education’s Intensive Wrap Around Service, which has let down both the school and parents.

“This once thriving school now has only nine students but there are probably many families who want their girls to attend.

“Salisbury meets the educational and social needs of their students and provides respite for their families.

“The government should also remove the two-year cap on funded placements. This will allow these young women the opportunity to complete their full secondary education at Salisbury, which is in their best interests.

“Salisbury School provides families with real choice for their high needs daughters. If the government doesn’t make it easier for families to access this valuable facility then its commitment to helping such students and their families has to be seriously questioned,” says Mrs Martin.
