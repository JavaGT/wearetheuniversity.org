Greens, Don’t Promote Drugs - NZ First
======================================

**Thursday, 17 February 2000, 3:10 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

  
New Zealand First MP, Ron Mark, has urged the Greens to concentrate on protecting the environment and the interests of New Zealanders instead of promoting mind-blowing drug use.

“There is already a serious problem associated with New Zealand’s drug culture, especially among the young, and MPs should be seeking solutions to the problem not making it worse.

“It is simplistic for Mr Tanczos to think that legalising more addictive, mood changing substances will help improve the lives of New Zealanders,” he said

“Thousands of young New Zealanders have serious drug problems. Many parents are worried about the prospects of these drugs becoming even more readily available.

“The critical issues facing young New Zealanders are the cost of education, and the lack of opportunity, jobs, and purpose in their lives.

“Instead of preaching about drunkenness and making silly speeches promoting drug use, the member would be better advised to assist those young enough to be attentive of his outbursts to turn to work and education to improve their lot, rather than urging them to get off their faces,” said Mr Mark.
