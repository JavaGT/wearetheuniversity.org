**Anger as Attacker Gets Bail**

Victims of crime need to be protected from the perpetrator – the victim's rights should supersede that of the perpetrator, says New Zealand First.

"On White Ribbon Day this week, we learnt of a case of violence against a woman going unpunished on grounds of insanity," says Corrections spokesperson Mahesh Bindra.

"The Papatoetoe woman who was attacked in the street by an architecture student, is being re-victimised by a system that has given the attacker freedom.

"It is unacceptable that the attacker's rights are more than that of the victim especially when the attacker was already recognised as suffering from a psychotic mental illness.

"We need to do all we can to keep New Zealanders safe, including providing adequate care for those that need it.

"Every New Zealander deserves to live in safety and those that breach it should be suitably punished.

“New Zealand First wants to tighten up parole laws. We want a review of bail and sentencing measures in order to address public concerns and expectations.

"The Government needs to ensure that victim's rights are paramount and every New Zealander protected," says Mr Bindra.
