Seniors Pushed Aside for Hip And Knee Surgery

Kiwis waiting for hip and knee joint replacements have been left suffering in pain under National, which has frozen funding despite creating a record population boom.

“Over 65s, who are more likely to require the surgery, are missing out at a time when their numbers are increasing substantially,” says New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Funding has not increased since National became government making a lie to any of their claims that it supports and looks after over 65s.

“This health crisis is a result of underfunding and population growth, which at 1.9% has eclipsed Australia’s rate of 1.4%. Aucklanders in particular are missing out as tens of thousands of immigrants have settled there – even the DHB has gone public about the strain from so much demand.

“A just released study from the Dunedin School of Medicine reveals government funding for hip and knee joint replacements is much the same as it was in 2007 while demand has risen considerably because of the bigger population.

“The government must put an immediate cap on immigration and ensure everyone gets the surgery they need. Over 65s who have paid taxes all their lives should not be scapegoats for nasty cost-cutting by National to create a surplus,” says Mr Peters.

Editor’s note: The Dunedin School of Medicine study is in the latest issue of the NZ Medical Journal
