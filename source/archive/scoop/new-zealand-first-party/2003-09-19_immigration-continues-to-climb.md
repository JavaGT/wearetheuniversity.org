Immigration Continues To Climb

New Zealand First has pointed out that the restructuring of New Zealand’s population continues unabated.

“Immigration figures for August 2003 show a 14% increase in permanent and long term migration numbers over the previous year,” said New Zealand First leader Winston Peters.

“These figures give the lie to the Government’s protestations and confirm that the pressures on our infrastructure, housing prices, and social services continue to build. At the same time New Zealanders are once again heading overseas in increasing numbers.

“Whilst the Minister of Immigration is unwilling or unable to provide accurate numbers as to the whereabouts or status of thousands of ‘so-called’ visitors Statistics New Zealand has highlighted net inflows of permanent and long term arrivals from China (13,600), India (5,800), Japan (2,300), Fiji (2,000), South Africa (1,900), Korea (1,700), and the United Kingdom (9,200). A new Timaru has been added, probably to an already clogged up and bogged down Auckland.

“All the while we have the Education Minister touting for fee paying students in Asia. While they are busy changing our country forever the Government might consider that the answer is to properly fund our schools so they don’t need to survive on this modern day equivalent of the school gala, and they might then be able to focus on education standards so as to ensure we upskill our own people and not rely on the wholesale turnover of our population, “ Mr Peters said.
