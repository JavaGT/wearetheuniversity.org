Immigration System Must Be Cleaned Up
=====================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

The amnesty for overstayers reflects an appalling situation which must be cleaned up, said the New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“It is completely unacceptable that more than twenty thousand overstayers are living in New Zealand - courtesy of no one - and now determining our Immigration policy.

“Successive Labour and National governments have turned blind eyes to the influx of people who have no legal right to be here, enjoying the benefits of New Zealand while contributing nothing.

“We are struggling to provide social services for New Zealand citizens and it is unreasonable and unfair to expect taxpayers to continue to be the benefactors of these people, said Mr Peters.
