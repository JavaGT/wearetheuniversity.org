Large-Scale Emergencies Deserve Urgent Legislative Attention

**LARGE-SCALE EMERGENCIES DESERVE URGENT LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION**

New Zealand First is concerned that the government is too slow with its promised legislation that will address large-scale emergences, such as Monday’s earthquakes.

A Bill which focussed on a smoother transition from response to recovery for small to moderate emergencies went through Parliament last week and is awaiting Royal Assent.

“This Bill was always pitched by the National government as a part one of a two-part process,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Civil Defence and Emergency Issues Clayton Mitchell.

“New Zealand First has made it clear at every stage that the first stage needed to be put through the House under urgency and implemented as soon as practicably possible.

“The Minister finally conceded yesterday that he would be moving the implementation date of the Bill forward with New Zealand First support.

“The second stage of the legislative review should be focussing on large-scale emergencies and will be closely aligned with the review of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011.

“Mr Brownlee has been unable to assure us that stage two of this review dealing with major civil defence emergencies would have legislation in Parliament soon.

“The government is failing New Zealanders by not advancing legislation that will protect them during large-scale emergencies despite recent major events and ever increasing seismic activity impacting on our country.”
