Zaoui Must Go

Zaoui Must Go

“Here we go again,” said New Zealand First leader Rt Hon Winston Peters after Ahmed Zaoui was granted refugee status today.

“It is time to stop wasting taxpayers’ money on a suspected terrorist,” said Mr Peters.

“If the Government allows the Zaoui decision to stand they are making a mockery of the whole country.

“Immigration Minister Lianne Dalziel has said that the cost to taxpayers’ so far has been $60,000 – a figure we believe to be grossly under-estimated. Zaoui is to remain in prison pending further security decisions – more cost to the New Zealand taxpayer.

“It is outrageous that this Government allows ten of thousands of dollars to be spent on a suspected terrorist when ordinary, law abiding New Zealanders struggle to meet their everyday essential needs.

“The Government must put a stop to this immediately and send Zaoui back to where he came from,” said Mr Peters.
