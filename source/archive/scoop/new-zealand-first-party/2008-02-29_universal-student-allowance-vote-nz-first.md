Universal Student Allowance? Vote NZ First

  
A universal student allowance is the key to reducing student debt and if students want it introduced, they should vote for New Zealand First, says the party’s education spokesperson Dail Jones.

“The fact that many of our brightest young people on whom our future prosperity rests have to borrow to live while studying verges on scandalous,” said Mr Jones.

“Starting working life with the millstone of study debt has major consequences for many graduates. A universal student allowance would go a long way to reducing debt on graduation. This is why the introduction of the allowance forms a key part of New Zealand First’s tertiary education policy.

“Students have a long history of voting for parties that fail to deliver for them. Students should know that what New Zealand First promises, it delivers. If students want the universal allowance introduced they should depart from the norm and vote for New Zealand First – the party with a proven record of delivering,” said Mr Jones.
