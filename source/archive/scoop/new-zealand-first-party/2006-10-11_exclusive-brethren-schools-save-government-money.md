Exclusive Brethren Schools Save Government Money

The Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, admitted in the House today that allowing the Exclusive Brethren to open their own schools has saved the government considerable funding.

“Because the total pool of funds for independent schools has been capped at $40m, the enrolment of 1300 students into these schools has not cost the government a cent. Instead all that has happened is that the per capita funding for other independent schools has been reduced,” said New Zealand First Education spokesman, Brian Donnelly.

“The parents of existing students have been hit in the pocket because fees have had to be increased to compensate for the reduced per capita grant.”

“The government has saved itself $1m per annum because previously the Brethren students were home-schooled and received a home-schooling allowance.”

“New Zealand First is urging the Labour-led government to revisit its policy which caps the total funding for independent schools and which creates such injustices that the Exclusive Brethren situation has,” said Mr Donnelly.
