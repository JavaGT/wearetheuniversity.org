Schools Ignored as Minister Goes with COOL

Spokesperson for Education

**SCHOOLS IGNORED AS MINISTER GOES WITH COOL**

New Zealand First wants to know why schools that have set up online learning networks were not consulted by the Ministry of Education before the Minister, Hekia Parata, announced she is setting up Communities of Online Learning (COOL).

“It’s unbelievable that the Minister and her Ministry did not talk to schools that share online learning with other schools to make maximum use of resources,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“Schools that have set up Virtual Learning Networks (VLNs) have opened up the curriculum choices for students. Through online learning, one school can provide resources that another may lack and vice versa. It’s about sharing and works well.

“It is a collaborative approach started by schools and communities.

“Blending education through using technology and teacher-to-student learning is already happening in schools and between schools.

“The networks, as they stand, incur no costs for schools and their students. They’re based on a reciprocal arrangement where schools and teachers share their expertise for the benefit of students. Changes as proposed by Minister Parata will more than likely mean that there will be charges for any future delivery.

“The Minister will probably say that these networks can apply for COOL status but any final decision regarding their future will be at her discretion. Why would schools want to jump through more bureaucratic hoops?” says Mrs Martin.
