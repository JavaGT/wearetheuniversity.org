Complaints Over Resthome Care Raise Concerns

The issue of abuse of elderly residents in rest homes is a deep-seated problem, says New Zealand First, and the Government is not doing enough.

Spokesman for Health Barbara Stewart questioned Associate Minister for Health Jo Goodhew in Parliament after reported complaints over lack of care in Waikato and Coromandel rest homes.

“While the Minister said these complaints had been followed up swiftly we are concerned that she is not taking an overall view of the situation in rest homes.

“Indeed, she disagreed that lack of regulation and staffing intensified problems, instead staying it was not numbers but quality of care that counts.

“Yet the New Zealand Nurses’ Organisation says the industry lacks regulation and the Service and Food Services Workers’ Union believes lack of regulation and staffing are problems.

“The Minister should not be ignoring the views of organisations that have so many members working within the industry.

“New Zealand First will be watching to see if the new national clinical assessment tool the Minister speaks about leads to a healthier environment for our elderly,” says Mrs Stewart.
