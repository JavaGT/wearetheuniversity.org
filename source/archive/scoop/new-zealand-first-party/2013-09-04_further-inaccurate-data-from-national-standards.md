Further Inaccurate Data from National Standards

**Further Inaccurate Data from National Standards**

The Government is failing to learn from its past mistakes of publishing inaccurate data at the expense of students says New Zealand First.

An independent study commissioned by the Ministry of Education has found teachers' use of the national standards last year lacked dependability.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says with no way of knowing how many of last year's national standards results are correct, the Government is repeating the NCEA experience of a decade of inaccurate data publication.

“Can we expect another ten years of flawed data with national standards?

“This will have a major impact on another generation of students, their families and place further stress on teaching staff.

“The Government ignored warnings from teachers and unions not to publish the data, and this report adds to their concerns.

“It is alarming that the so-called evidence will enable the Minister to challenge the professional judgement of teachers and school leaders.

“Will this report provide justification for Minister Parata to put the Progress and Consistency Tool (PaCT) back on the mandatory table after her earlier about-face?

“The published data does nothing at all for individual student wellbeing, progress and achievement.

“Instead it could be used as ammunition and fired at individual teachers under the guise of performance pay,” warns Ms Martin.
