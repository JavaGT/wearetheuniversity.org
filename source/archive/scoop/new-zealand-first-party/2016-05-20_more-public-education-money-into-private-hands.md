More Public Education Money into Private Hands
==============================================

Tracey Martin MP

Spokesperson for Education

More Public Education Money into Private Hands

New Zealand First is repeating its pledge to close charter schools in light of today’s announcement by the government to open more charter schools.

“This Act Party policy is nothing more than a cynical shift of public education money into predominately private hands,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin. “Let’s not forget that the closed Whangaruru School Sponsor is still the legal owner of the farm purchased with New Zealand taxpayer dollars.

“We would ensure this terrible waste of public money comes to an end and is redirected back into the front line of our mainstream education system.

“It is outrageous that the government is forcing all taxpayers to fund a policy that comes from a party which received less than 1 per cent of votes at the last election.

"Charter Schools are behaving like private schools, picking and choosing their students, but they are funded with 100 per cent taxpayers’ money. Some are declining entry to students or excluding students who might lower their pass rates.

“Despite this, Mr Seymour stands in Parliament, lauding pass rates in an attempt to justify his under-secretary salary.”

“The policy is inherently unfair and New Zealand First would abolish it.”
