Say No to ‘Tick Box’ Education for Our Kids
===========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Tracey Martin MP  
Spokesperson for Education  
21 JULY 2016

  
Say No to ‘Tick Box’ Education for Our Kids

New Zealand First reiterates its concerns that the National Government is going to use the Progress and Consistency Tool (PaCT) to "standardise" the professional judgement of teachers in light of a recently released Ministry of Education report.

“The National Government has been consistently working towards a narrow test-based education system.

“We believe they will use this latest report on the failure of their own National Standards policy to close the last loop hole.

“They will now justify making it compulsory for our teachers to use the PaCT tool which is as close as you can get to tick box education,” says Mrs Martin.

“New Zealand First has always argued that the standards are flawed not our teaching staff.

“We need to return to staged progressions within curriculum levels while at the same time collect nationwide school entry data.

“We should be providing equity funding for all students who need it to close the obvious opportunity gap that the government has created over the last decade.”
