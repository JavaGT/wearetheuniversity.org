Celebrating 23 Years
====================

**Monday, 18 July 2016, 1:38 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

**Rt Hon Winston Peters**  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland  
18 JULY 2016

**Celebrating 23 Years**

New Zealand First is needed now more than ever in the New Zealand Parliament, says Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters as the party celebrates its 23rd birthday today.

“We have had years of visionless government, which New Zealanders are now paying the price for, particularly in the lack of affordable housing and an economy relying on one market.

“New Zealand First was formed in July 1993 to make a stand for New Zealanders and the country, just as our name sets out.

“As one of only three long established parties in both First past the post and MMP environments we represent Kiwis who are not getting a fair deal and those who did not fare well from Labour and National governments that sold state assets, oversaw the loss of thousands of jobs, opened up to foreign ownership without securing the benefits, and failed at economic management resulting in a massive growth in inequality.

“New Zealand First alone, stands for one law for all regardless of race or wealth.

“We are the only political party that has never done backroom pre-election deals behind the voters’ backs.”

Mr Peters will be speaking to celebrate the birthday in Mt Maunganui on Saturday at the Omanu Bowls Club at 12.30pm.
