Public Safety and Trust in Police Is Strained

**Public Safety and Trust in Police Is Strained**

The operational capability and effectiveness of our Police force are being strained by budget cuts and limited resources, says New Zealand First.

The New Zealand Police published their performance indicators’ table today, which revealed concerning data relating to public safety and trust says associate spokesperson for law and order Asenati Lole-Taylor.

“While it is encouraging to see performance indicators showing regions reaching the public safety target of 92 per cent, the Counties Manukau area is below the target with 86 per cent of residents feeling safe in their neighbourhood.

“The performance table also shows that public trust is below the 78 per cent target in Waikato, Counties Manukau, Central and Northland regions.

“The New Zealand Police are doing the best they can despite being strained by bureaucratic red-tape and budget cuts.

“Their effectiveness and operational capabilities are being single-handedly undermined by this National Government who would rather ‘save-a-buck’ than direct more resources to the men and women who work hard to make our communities safe.

“The Government needs to realise that if they continue to pursue the current path, future performance tables will not change for the better and our communities will be the ones that suffer,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
