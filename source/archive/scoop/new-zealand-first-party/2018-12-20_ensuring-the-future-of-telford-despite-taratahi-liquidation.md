Ensuring the Future of Telford Despite Taratahi Liquidation

The Taratahi Institute of Agriculture has announced that they’ve appointed an interim liquidator following financial troubles since 2014. The Tertiary Education Commission, NZQA, and Studylink will work to ensure students and staff are supported through the process.

“This is a massive blow to the agriculture sector and hard news for students and staff at Taratahi right before Christmas. This highlights the work that needs to be done to ensure we have the right agriculture training model to meet industry needs,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Agriculture Mark Patterson.

“I will be looking to work with the Board of Telford, civic leaders, and relevant Ministers on developing options to keep the Balclutha institute open. The Balclutha Telford campus in South Otago is home to 120 residential students and has had strong financial performance – despite the woes of its parent organisation,” says Mr Patterson.

“It is imperative that Telford can continue to provide delivery of vocational services to meet the significant demand in Otago and Southland, and I am confident we will get that outcome.”
