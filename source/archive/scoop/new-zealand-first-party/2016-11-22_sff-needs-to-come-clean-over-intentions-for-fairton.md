SFF Needs to Come Clean Over Intentions for Fairton

SFF Needs to Come Clean Over Intentions for Fairton

[The axing of Fairton’s](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/80717876/silver-fern-farms-has-no-plans-to-close-waitane) second chain is another indication the big Ashburton meat processing plant is being steadily run down by Silver Fern Farms (SFF) to be shut, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The chain was supposed to start on November 15 but the company, which is now controlled by Chinese company Shanghai Maling, cited staff shortages for it not opening.

“In June, Fairton’s entire bobby calf kill was transferred to SFF’s Pareora plant south of Timaru, taking work away from Fairton staff.

“Now, with Fairton’s No 2 chain shut and with only one chain operating since the beginning of the month, Pareora is to operate a third night shift chain which is expected to start soon. Pareora’s first chain started this week; the second chain will begin next week.

“In June, the company’s CEO Dean Hamilton stated: ‘All of our 19 plants have been operational this year, other than the announced decision to relocate venison processing from Islington to Pareora due to our lease expiry, there has been no decision taken by the company to do anything differently next year at any plant.’

“However, last month the company shut its plants in Mossburn, Southland, and Wairoa, Hawke’s Bay. In a purchase document, Shanghai Maling stated an intention to close Fairton and Waitane plant in Gore.

“It is obvious SFF is implementing a rationalisation programme.

“The company has not been up front and honest about their future plans and this continues with Fairton. They should not be allowing workers and Mid-Canterbury to go through a long drawn out agony which is impacting negatively on the region’s economy,” Mr Peters says.
