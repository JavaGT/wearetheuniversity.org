Jobs for the Boys And Girls – When is It Going to End?

Jobs for the Boys And Girls – When is It Going to End?

  
The after-Parliament gravy train continues to steam ahead for former National MPs and Cabinet ministers, says New Zealand First.

The latest to score in the jobs-for the-boys allocation is former National Party MP for Whangarei and Cabinet Minister Phil Heatley, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

His win comes just days after former National MP Tau Henare scored a seat on the Housing New Zealand Corporation board, adding to his government appointment on the Rules Reduction Taskforce, says Mr Peters.

“The Key government has appointed Mr Heatley to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority board, with an honorarium of at least $14,000.

“While Minister of Energy Simon Bridges claims Mr Heatley will bring ‘additional valuable energy sector expertise to the board’ it was this very portfolio that Mr Heatley was dumped from in 2013, presumably for not being up to the job. He only had it for just over a year. He was also dumped from Housing.

“The latest after-Parliament perk adds to his new role as Northland Regional Council’s special projects manager, a newly created position.

“Surely there are more well deserving candidates who could admirably fill the positions, who have not had the advantage of a long term job in Parliament.

“What happened to Mr Heatley leaving and moving to, what he said would be, ‘fresh challenges and opportunities in the private sector’?

“Instead, it seems, Mr Heatley continues to rely on the public purse. Just like all the rest.

“A small selection and some of their government appointments: Eric Roy, Landcorp Farming Limited (Board); Wayne Mapp, Law Commissioner; Georgina Te Heuheu, Maori Television (Board); Kate Wilkinson, Environment Court (Commissioner); Jenny Shipley, Canterbury earthquake roles, chair Genesis Power; Katherine Rich, Apec Business Advisory, Health Promotion Agency, Agriculture Emissions Trading Scheme Advisory Committee; Michelle Boag, president Middle East Business Council, and many, many more.”
