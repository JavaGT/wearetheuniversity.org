Government Hands Streets to Crims

New Zealand First has accused the Government of handing the streets over to the criminal community in order to balance its books.

Associate Spokesperson for Police Asenati Lole-Taylor says it is unacceptable that police numbers have fallen from 8940 in June 2012 to 8721 in February 2013.

“This is problematic for communities like South Auckland, Northland and Waikato that require more frontline staff.”

“National announced in 2008 that they intended to ‘boost Police numbers’ in places where crime often occurs.

“In 2008, the Government committed $18.5 million to recruiting, training and employing extra police staff. If police numbers have declined, where is the $18.5 million and where is this now being spent?” says Ms Lole-Taylor.

“New Zealand First put an extra 1,000 police on the streets between 2005-2008 but now this Government is making false economies over the safety and welfare of our most vulnerable communities.

“A lot of emphasis has been placed on communities such as South Auckland and increasing the visibility of Police, but how are we increasing the visibility of our Police nationwide if numbers are falling?” asks Mrs Lole-Taylor.
