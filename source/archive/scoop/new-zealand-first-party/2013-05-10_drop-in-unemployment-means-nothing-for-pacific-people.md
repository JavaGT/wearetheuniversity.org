Drop in Unemployment Means Nothing for Pacific People

**Drop in Unemployment Means Nothing for Pacific People**

New statistics revealing a fall in the unemployment rate from 6.8 per cent to 6.2 per cent does little for Pacific Islanders, according to New Zealand First’s Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs, Asenati Lole-Taylor.

She has pointed out that the unemployment rate for Pacific people currently sits at an unacceptable level of more than 15 per cent.

“National is failing the Pacific community, with the rate of Pacific people who are unemployed still disproportionately high.”

Mrs Lole-Taylor says desperate action is needed to get all New Zealanders back into work because the unemployment statistics actually show that only the Canterbury area has an improving job situation.

“I am especially concerned for Pacific young people. While unemployment for young people aged 20-24 has also decreased, Pacific young people are still more likely to be jobless than other groups in society.

“This National-led government needs to stop hiding behind statistics and instead look at the real issues. The latest unemployment result conceals a far bigger problem,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
