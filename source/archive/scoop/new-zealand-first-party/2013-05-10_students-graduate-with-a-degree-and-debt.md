Students Graduate with a Degree – And Debt

**Students Graduate with a Degree – And Debt**

New Zealand First applauds students graduating today for drawing attention to the horrendous amount of debt many face as a result of undertaking tertiary study.

Auckland students are wearing stickers on their gowns to indicate how much debt they’ve clocked up.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says many New Zealanders have no real idea of the significant debt young people have incurred in their quest to be part of the bigger, brighter future this Government tells them it wants.

“It’s particularly appropriate that the issue is highlighted during Youth Week.

“High levels of debt affect university students, those in trade-based courses and anyone who requires a StudyLink loan to pay course fees for their education.

“This situation is driving more and more of our brightest students overseas for a high paying job so they can pay back their loans and this does nothing to boost prosperity in this country.

“New Zealand First is committed to easing the burden on students by introducing a partial debt write-off scheme for graduates who remain in the country,” says Ms Martin.
