Interest On Student Loans Must Come Down - Peters
=================================================

**Monday, 19 July 1999, 12:06 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters has announced a reduction in student loan interest rates as part of New Zealand First’s policy.

Speaking yesterday to 672 delegates at the New Zealand First convention in Auckland, Mr Peters said that today’s interest rates were crippling students and causing many of them to flee overseas.

“New Zealand First is going to help young people. We believe that education spending is an investment –not an expense.

“We are going to reduce the interest rates on student loans. We are going to peg their interest rates to the CPI plus two per cent.

“At present they pay over seven per cent. We need our young people here, in New Zealand if we are to get New Zealand back on the path of economic recovery”, he said.

“The best immigrant is the son or daughter of a New Zealand citizen returning home”.
