Bay of Plenty–Waiariki Merger Overrides Community Voice

Bay of Plenty–Waiariki Merger Overrides Community Voice

Despite huge opposition to the merger of Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and Waiariki Institute of Technology, it is going ahead, says New Zealand First.

“Yet again a National Party Minister has decided he knows best and discounted the 66 per cent of submitters opposed or strongly opposed to this merger,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Education Tracey Martin.

“Many people were concerned about the loss of provision for Rotorua and Waiariki’s connection to the Bay of Plenty regional communities of Whakatane, Taupō, Opotiki, Turangi, Kawerau and Tokoroa.

“New Zealand First had hoped that Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce would respect the democratic process, but once again this government has ridden roughshod over the voice of a local community.

“Now the decision to merge has been made, it is crucial that the Minister engages meaningfully with all those people working and learning at Waiariki.

“New Zealand First will be watching closely,” says Mrs Martin.
