Drowning Toll Makes School Pools More Important than Ever

**Drowning Toll Makes School Pools More Important than Ever**

Keeping pools in schools operating is one way to help beat the rising drowning toll, says New Zealand First.

“The latest figures from Water Safety New Zealand make for sad reading,” says Education Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

“One hundred and thirteen people drowned in New Zealand waters in 2015, twenty three more than in 2014.

“That’s 113 families that have been devastated by the loss of a loved one.

“How long do we have to wait before the government meets its responsibilities to fund the basic aquatics skills which schools are expected to deliver in the New Zealand Curriculum?’

“Yet again, New Zealand First renews our call for the government to allow schools to access their five and ten year funding for pool maintenance and enhancement.

“This is not a big ask but it is hugely important because many school pools are at risk of being shut down because the schools simply cannot afford to pay for maintenance from their tight operations grants.

“Making this funding available immediately will take the pressure off schools and ensure they can keep their pools open and up to standard.

  
“For the Secretary of Education to propose that the answer is to bus students out to council-owned pools shows a callous disregard for rural communities who would have to travel long distances.

“Basic water survival skills are part of the New Zealand Curriculum and should not be another cost dumped onto already financially stretched parents.

“We challenge the government to remove this bureaucratic roadblock now or will we be here again next year lamenting yet another rise in our drowning toll?”
