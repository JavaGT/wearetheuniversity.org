Tate Land Agency Addresses Housing Crisis

  
New Zealand First’s plan for a state agency to buy and hold land is common sense, and will be effective into the future, says New Zealand First Housing spokesperson Denis O’Rourke.

“New Zealand First’s policy cuts to one of the core problems, while National fiddles as the dream of a home for most young Kiwis lies in ashes. Their announcement of KiwiSaver changes will not address the housing crisis which they deny exists.

“The crisis is fuelled by too many buyers, including foreign speculators, well-off Kiwis buying rental properties and red hot immigration levels. It is made worse by the lack of houses being built.

"The National government has done nothing over six years - their figures on house building largely relate to post earthquake Canterbury.

“In New Zealand's very small economy, it is essential for the government to invest directly to ensure that the supply of smaller and more affordable homes are built in the numbers needed.

“National has ignored housing, leaving it to the profit making private sector. It has not worked.

“New Zealand First plans to have more affordable sections to be sold over 25 years, at 2 per cent interest for at least the first five years.

“Some such land must also be used for Housing New Zealand to build the tens of thousands of state rentals for people whose only option is to rent a home.

"The government's chronic slothfulness in addressing all aspects of the housing crisis cannot be solved by knee-jerk electioneering announcements in the absence of a comprehensive housing plan,” says Mr O’Rourke.
