Bill Requires Parent Migrants to Hold Health Insurance

Eighty thousand migrants over 50 years of age have settled in New Zealand in the past 15 years, with full rights to use the public health system.

“Hospitals are always under a huge workload so why would a government make it so much worse?” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

‘All migrants coming under the parent reunion category should hold private health insurance to ease the burden on taxpayer funded healthcare.

New Zealand First’s Affordable Healthcare Bill, sponsored by Mr Peters, is expected to have its first reading in Parliament today. The Bill requires older migrants to maintain health insurance for their first 10 years in the country of residency. This measure covering elective surgery would bring New Zealand in line with the requirements of other countries.

“Our goal is to alleviate pressure on the health system and to be fairer to Kiwis who have contributed to the economy and paid taxes to support it,” Mr Peters said.

The Bill also includes a SuperGold 25 per cent rebate on average health insurance premiums to make insurance more affordable for Seniors at an age when premiums rise and incomes drop.
