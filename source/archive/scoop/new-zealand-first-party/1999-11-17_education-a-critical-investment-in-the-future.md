Education a Critical Investment in the Future
=============================================

**Wednesday, 17 November 1999, 3:23 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

In releasing New Zealand First’s Education Plan, Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly has reiterated the importance of education to the future of New Zealand in the 21st century.

“The quality of the future we leave to our children is determined by the quality of the children we leave for our future” said Mr Donnelly, echoing the philosophy which underpins New Zealand First’s policy.

“Our Education Plan is family focused to reflect our belief that the foundation for education lies in the home.

“New Zealand First will focus on programmes which assist families to provide the best learning environment and the highest standard of educational care and development”, confirmed Mr Donnelly.

New Zealand First remains committed to the concept of “Tomorrow’s Schools” but believes that some structural refinements are necessary to enable it to function fully.

At the tertiary level New Zealand First believes that the existing regime is too harsh, particularly on middle income families.

Mr Donnelly reiterated the party’s intention to reduce interest rates on student loans to the CPI while studying, plus two percent on completion and to increase the proportion of the tertiary tuition subsidy to that of the 1998 budget.

“We must remove all obstacles to ensure the continuation of an education system which encourages every New Zealander to achieve his or her potential”
