Maoridom Loses Strong Advocate, Says NZ First

With the passing of Dr Ranginui Walker, Maoridom has lost a strong advocate and a highly respected academic, says New Zealand First.

“He was one who recognised the importance of education and was not just a proud Māori, but also a proud New Zealander,” New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters says.

“He will be missed by his family and all who knew him personally, and by the nation to which he contributed so much.

“We offer his family our condolences.”
