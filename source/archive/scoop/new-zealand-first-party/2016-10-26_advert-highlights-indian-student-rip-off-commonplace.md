Advert Highlights Indian Student Rip Off Commonplace

**COUNTDOWN ADVERT HIGHLIGHTS INDIAN STUDENT RIP OFF COMMONPLACE**

An advertisement seeking "Asian student labor", "cash $6.50 behind screen" was boldly placed on a Countdown noticeboard in Auckland despite being a blatant abuse of our laws, says New Zealand First.

"It confirms the rip off of students, often by people from their own countries, is so commonplace employers are advertising publicly.

"There have been so many cases of exploitation yet the government has been slow and weak to act. The Prime Minister has a lot of explaining to do in India over the abuse of Indian students in this country.

"The Countdown advertisement confirms the advertiser, a motelier, is not fearful of authorities. The owner ‘Indian’, the manager ‘Chinese’ accepts that low wages and cash payments are everyday practice.

"Even Countdown saw nothing wrong with allowing the notice to be pinned up.

"This is exploitation in broad daylight not in back alleys and behind closed doors.

"There can be only one reason – it is widespread, there is little policing of advertising and work conditions, and unfortunately New Zealand has sunk to Third World practices.

"National has allowed exploitation to explode by an excessive intake of foreign students and lack of proper scrutiny of student visa applications."
