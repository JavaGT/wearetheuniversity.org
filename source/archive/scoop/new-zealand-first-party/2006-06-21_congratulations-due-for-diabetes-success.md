Congratulations Due For Diabetes Success

  
News that doctors at Starship children’s hospital have developed new techniques to help manage Type 2 diabetes are cause for celebration, says New Zealand First’s health spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“It has been predicted that the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may double in 15 years and that by 2021 treatment of type 2, often triggered by obesity, could cost $1b, or up to 12 per cent of the total health budget.

“This means that any advances made in treatment methods are of great significance in what could be a long running battle.

“Diabetes screening in some schools has been used as part of the Auckland trial programme and could be a valuable means of early detection.

“New Zealand First’s proposed Teen Health Check Bill advocates health checks for all Year 9 students and given the dire consequences for child sufferers, diabetes screening should definitely be included,” said Mrs Stewart.
