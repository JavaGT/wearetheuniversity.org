Heads Should Roll Over Disgraceful Kiwirail Decision
====================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland

Heads Should Roll Over Disgraceful Kiwirail Decision

KiwiRail’s drastic reduction in the Whangarei-Auckland train service from next week is a disgrace and being done under subterfuge, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The Auckland-Whangarei service will be cut from 20 train movements per week to 10; five each way.

“The result will be a significant drop in tonnage and it comes just a week after KiwiRail shut down the Otiria-Kauri line – or movements on the line – whilst ministers in Parliament keep saying the line is still open.

“If KiwiRail is doing the government’s bidding and shutting services as forecast, effectively they’re shutting down critical rail services to regional New Zealand.

“Meanwhile, multiple unit leviathans are heading down our highways causing enormous damage to roads and creating major safety issues.  
“This is one further disgraceful KiwiRail decision and death by a thousand cuts for the provinces.

“New Zealand First would fire a KiwiRail board comprised of National Party lackeys,” Mr Peters says.
