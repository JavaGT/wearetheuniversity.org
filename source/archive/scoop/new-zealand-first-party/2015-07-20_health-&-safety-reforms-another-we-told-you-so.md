Health & Safety Reforms – Another “We Told You So"

**Health & Safety Reforms – Another New Zealand First “We Told You So”**

Having warned in May that National’s Health and Safety reforms could open a Pandora’s Box the Rt Hon Winston Peters wants Kiwis to be reassured that New Zealand First is hearing their concerns loud and clear.

“New Zealand First has been the only party to express its unease about the dragnet nature of another National legislative ‘cut and paste’ from Australia,” says Mr Peters.

“You know something is bad when Fish & Game and Federated Farmers can agree that a piece of legislation is heading down the wrong track. New Zealand First is alarmed at how unintended consequences like this are still being identified.

“Treating farms as worksites and making farmers liable for all ‘visitors’, be they anglers, hunters or trampers, simply makes it is easier to erect ‘Worksite. No Entry’ signs.

“It is also worrying to see how they’ve reacted to similar legislation overseas; one Australian retailer [reportedly requires](http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/charity-plugs-on-despite-red-tape/2616008/) public liability insurance before allowing sausage sizzles. How it evolves here will hinge upon legal opinions and the interpretation of the courts.

“New Zealand First wants to get the balance right between health and safety rights and obligations and our Spokesperson, Clayton Mitchell, is using his small businessperson’s perspective to provide just that,” says Mr Peters.
