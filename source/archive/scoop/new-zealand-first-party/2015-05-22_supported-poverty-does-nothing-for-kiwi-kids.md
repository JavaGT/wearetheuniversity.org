Supported Poverty Does Nothing for Kiwi Kids

  
Budget 2015 is creating ‘supported poverty’ that will not improve the life of one single child, says New Zealand First.

“The pittance National is putting into welfare will not get them off the hook from neglecting struggling Kiwis,” says Social Development Spokesperson Darroch Ball.

“While some in social agencies say National has made an important first step to recognising that many are in need we don’t agree.

“Let’s never forget it was National, and the ‘mother of all budgets’ in 1991 that severely cut welfare, and they have taken the axe to it in many ways since.

“National has turned a country of reasonable equality into one of appalling inequality.

“Budget 2015 did nothing to get people off welfare and low incomes and into jobs with fair pay. Where was the job creation?

“Instead National is flooding the country with immigrants – a record in the past year at over 114,000 people. It has extended visas for more and more low-skilled migrant workers, yet there are thousands of New Zealanders out of work, in casual jobs or part-time jobs.

“National has ignored 40 years of research and only reacted when they recognised there might be some political gain.

“But the Budget payment of an average of two dollars a day does not improve the health and education of a single child.

“All National has done is create supported poverty. They are tinkering around the edges in a haphazard approach.

“There is an urgent need for a comprehensive plan that ensures our welfare safety net is real. That translates to a dry safe house and nutritional food.”
