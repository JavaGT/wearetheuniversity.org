Driving Down Wages through Record Migration

Driving Down Wages through Record Migration

  
The National government is using uncontrolled migration as a crude device to drive down wages and lower living standards, says New Zealand First.

“Minister of Immigration Michael Woodhouse quibbled over terminology, and refused to adequately answer questions on numbers in Parliament today,” says New Zealand First Member of Parliament Ron Mark. “It was a poor show and reinforces our belief that National is content with a record level of migration.

“How is Auckland supposed to plan given a significant number of the people who come to New Zealand will settle in our biggest city?

“With net migration at the highest ever figure of 45,400, the government should be building thousands of houses a year just for new New Zealanders, but in fact, they have only built five houses for everyone.

“An urgent debate is needed on how many people New Zealand needs – we must ensure there are benefits for our country and not adverse effects. We must have a plan.

“Just last month the British Labour Party admitted that open-door immigration in the UK had undercut workers’ wages and lowered living standards.

“The party also admitted it had covered up a string of damaging reports about the impact of mass immigration,” says Mr Mark.

“Uncontrolled migration is forcing Kiwis into queues for hospital beds, housing and jobs. It’s unfair on New Zealanders.”
