Manufacturers Battered By Failed Government Policies

**Manufacturers Battered By Failed Government Policies**

New Zealand First says new data proves regional manufacturers are being hammered by Government policies that are wrecking the economy.

Commerce spokesperson Andrew Williams says today’s BNZ-BusinessNZ survey shows manufacturers taking a massive financial hit as the Government sits watching from the sidelines.

“The figures for April reveal an alarming downward trend for manufacturing as the Government and its spin merchants try to tell us that we are coming out of the recessionary tunnel.

“In reality the light at the end of the tunnel is a barely distinguishable pin prick.”

Mr Williams says the figures for prime manufacturing regions such as Otago/Southland and Canterbury/Westland show an economy in serious decline.

“The situation is not much better in other big manufacturing areas in northern and central New Zealand.

“A shrinking manufacturing sector will impact on jobs, incomes, and the overall prosperity of the country.

“It’s a disgrace that the Government would rather manufacture excuses about its failed economic experiment rather than take action to stop the decline.

“With such appalling figures in the manufacturing sector, it’s no wonder 1000 Kiwis a week are leaving to go to Australia,” says Mr Williams.
