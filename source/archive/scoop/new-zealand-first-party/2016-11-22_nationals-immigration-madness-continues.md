National’s Immigration Madness Continues

New Zealand’s reckless immigration policy continues to run amok with yet another record being set, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament, Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Statistics NZ says the October 2016 annual net gain – more arrivals than departures of migrants – reached 70,300.

“We have tens of thousands of young New Zealanders who can’t get a job, congested roads, a housing crisis, over-burdened hospitals and schools and yet the government persists with a madcap policy that is not working in the best interests of all New Zealanders.

“The high level of low-skilled workers coming to New Zealand, including international students, has undermined working conditions and put a lid on wages.

“New Zealand First is not opposed to immigration but we believe in accepting migrants we need, and not those who need us,” says Mr Peters.

“It is clear that the government’s only strategy for the 2017 election is bloat the economy with consumption and perpetuate the myth that consumption growth equals real GDP per person growth.

“It doesn’t, and as the one political party that understands that we intend to blow their political strategy clean out of the water.”
