**State House Sell-Off A Failure**

The only landlord for a state house should be the government, says New Zealand First.

“These houses were paid for by the taxpayer and should remain in the hands of New Zealanders,” says Ria Bond, New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill.

“Dunedin-based charity organisation PACT Group, who were set to buy and manage 348 state houses in Invercargill, have pulled out of the deal delivering a devastating political blow to National’s state house sell-off.

“PACT provides great services to people in need in Southland, Otago, the West Coast and Wellington and we respect their decision,” says Ms Bond.

“While Finance Minister Bill English and Social Housing Minister Paula Bennett claim the broken deal won’t have any impact on tenants – we disagree. Uncertainty around housing is a national issue and one this government is struggling to contain.”
