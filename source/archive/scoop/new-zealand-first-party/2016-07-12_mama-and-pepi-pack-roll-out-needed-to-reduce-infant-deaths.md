Mama And Pepi Pack Roll-Out Needed to Reduce Infant Deaths

Mama And Pepi Pack Roll-Out Needed to Reduce Infant Deaths

With 50 new born babies dying each year in their sleep, New Zealand First is renewing its call for a national roll-out of Mama and Pepi (baby) packs.

“The government is relying solely on education to reduce the incidence of Kiwi babies being suffocated as they sleep, but as we have the worst rates of sudden infant deaths in the industrialised world, education alone will not tackle this issue,” says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“We need an inclusive strategy of prevention with all possible solutions promoted and used, rather than sitting back and hoping it sorts itself.

“Since April 2015 Waikato DHB’s Mama and Pepi packs, adopted from a Finnish model used for 75 years, have provided a sleeping bassinet, bedding, and numerous other new-born necessities to expectant mothers.

“With at least 12 Coroners recommending the government supply bassinets for new-borns, New Zealand First again calls for a national roll-out of Mama and Pepi packs to help reduce the often preventable deaths of Kiwi babies,” says Mrs Stewart.
