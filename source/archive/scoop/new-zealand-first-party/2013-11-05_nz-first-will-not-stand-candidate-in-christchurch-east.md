**NZ First Will Not Stand Candidate in Christchurch East**

New Zealand First has decided after long consideration not to stand a candidate in the Christchurch East by-election but will continue to push for a better deal for earthquake victims.

Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says residents fighting for the restoration of their lives, their homes and their suburbs don’t need a political talkfest right now – they need action.

“There is something hollow about politicians parading around Christchurch trying to make political capital while some people live in garages without proper services.

“We will use the tens of thousands of dollars that a by-election campaign costs to promote a better deal for Christchurch and concentrate on making major changes for the better leading into the next election,” says Mr Peters.
