Ethnic Engineering “Frightening” Says Peters

New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says the latest immigration figures show that the Government is involved in ethnic engineering at a “frightening level”.

The figures show that in the year ending September 2002 there was a net inflow of 37,100 permanent and long-term migrants, compared with a net outflow of 1,700 in the previous year – a turnaround of nearly 40,000 people.

There were significant inflows from China (14,600) India (6,500) United Kingdom (5,900) South Africa (3,100) Japan (2,300) Fiji (2,200) and Korea (2,000).

“New Zealand cannot cope with this number of immigrants. Most of them have gone to Auckland, which is staggering under the weight of the invasion.

“House prices are soaring, roads are gridlocked and health, education and welfare facilities are overloaded.”

Mr Peters said he was also deeply concerned at the high levels of immigration from Third World countries and questioned how these people would fit into New Zealand society.

“The Government is changing the face and structure of New Zealand society by stealth. It is bringing in tens of thousands of people from countries with customs and cultures totally different to our own. We are heading down the road to social disaster.

“Nobody gave Labour a mandate for ethnic engineering. It has to be stopped now,” said Mr Peters.
