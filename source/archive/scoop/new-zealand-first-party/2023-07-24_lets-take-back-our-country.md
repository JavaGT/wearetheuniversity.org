'Let’s Take Back Our Country'
=============================

**Monday, 24 July 2023, 11:20 am**  
**Speech: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

_New Zealand First Convention_  
_Rt. Hon Winston  
Peters_  
_2pm Sunday 23rd 2023_  
_Mt Smart  
Stadium_  
_Eastern Lounge_

Ladies and  
Gentlemen. Thank you for being here, at New Zealand  
First’s campaign launch.

81 days before Election  
Day, 69 days before Early Voting begins and 64 days before  
Overseas Voting starts, we meet here on a mission to save  
our country.

No doubt you’re thinking to yourself  
‘what’s in it for me?’. Given the other party slogans  
already out there, and one in particular, that is a very  
good question.

This election must be about the  
economy. Because every issue inevitably comes back to what  
we must do and how we pay for it. And there’s the rub,  
because so many of the political promises of other parties  
being made have no chance of ever being kept.

Why?  
Well, if those parties have never delivered what they  
campaigned on in better times, they certainly won’t  
deliver on them in troubled times.

Remember Henry  
Ford’s words – ‘You can’t build a reputation on what  
you’re going to do’. Henry Ford built cars that ordinary  
people could afford. Right? All manner of politicians today  
are promising you a faster horse.

The critical issues  
for this election are our economy and cost of living crisis,  
our broken health system, our lack of law and order, our  
failing education system, and the cost of housing and  
rentals.

But if these five areas of crisis are not  
enough already, our very democracy is at risk from a rising  
tide of racism and separatism, that has given birth to  
secret social engineering that you were never warned about  
and most certainly never agreed to.

What’s the  
evidence for this? It’s the Prime Minister’s bonfire  
after he got the job - but the bonfire was for the paper  
back copies of Labour’s books, whilst they are saving the  
hard bound copies for after the election.

Vehicle  
Change
----------------

It is clear that a great majority of New  
Zealanders, including many Labour voters, don’t want more  
of the same. They are hard up against it, with rising costs  
everywhere, and no money left over after buying the  
essentials.

This majority rightfully expect to have a  
voice, yet Wellington is clearly not listening. New  
Zealanders are sick of all the changing definitions of  
economic and personal income security, and a vacuous goal of  
‘wellbeing’, whatever that means. They know that they  
are forgotten New Zealanders slogging it out in difficult  
jobs and they ask – “where is the promise, where is the  
hope, where is the commitment that if we work, save, and be  
good citizens then tomorrow will be better for  
us”.

And remember many of New Zealand’s present  
day well off started as workers. Very few of them inherited  
their wealth, and malignant envy is no way to level up  
society. There must be rewards for sweat, tears, sacrifice,  
and savings. Many of us, and them, do remember from personal  
experience what poverty smells, tastes, and feels  
like.

Our country’s economic and social malaise did  
not happen overnight, but it’s got dramatically worse in  
just 33 months.

Too many of our young have no memory  
of when our country was a world leader, in health and  
education, and house ownership, and personal income the envy  
of nearly every other country. Let’s be honest, we have  
not delivered for them what our parents delivered for  
us.

Ladies and gentlemen, if we don’t change  
direction we are certain to end up where we are going -  
down. So, be careful about the promises politicians make in  
this campaign, and ask this question – if their policies  
work, then why didn’t they work the last time they had  
power? Remember, ‘if you’re in the desert a mirage can  
be fatal’.

The next government must have real  
answers for problems economic and social, and not some  
ideological experiment where you and our country are the  
guinea pigs. Please ask, when and where did their policies  
ever work?

New Zealand has not paid its way since  
1972\. We must have policies in 2023 to grow, earn, and pay  
our way in to the future. Not overnight because that is  
impossible but improving year on year as other first world  
nations, once way behind us, now way ahead of us, have  
done.

New Zealand’s Gifted Inheritance
--------------------------------

We  
have the resources, and we work the second longest hours in  
the OECD, so it can’t be the worker’s fault. The fault  
line of failure leads to Wellington, and we are going to  
have to fix that right here, right now.

How few  
commentators said a year ago that New Zealand is heading for  
a recession? Less than the fingers on one hand. Not strange  
really because most of these touted experts work for banks,  
foreign owned banks - and fake confidence is the reason for  
their existence.

Today many commentators say we are  
‘broke’. But what they never say is we’re broke of  
ideas and polices to fix this country’s economy, and  
dramatically improve our national income and social  
performance. And what some of these experts don’t like, is  
being reminded that when we were number one in the world  
most of the politicians then had never been to university.  
They gaslight such success as “nostalgia”.

Longing  
for a past that they say is no longer possible. Well, we say  
it is possible again - but not with your  
policies.

That’s why when we look abroad, we see  
countries that have modernised following the script that  
once made us a world leader. Once poor countries like  
Singapore, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Ireland and an Island  
called Taiwan, transformed their economies to become wealth  
creators, maximising added value before exporting,  
maximising IT to assist wealth creation, providing great  
health systems and educating their people to the max, and  
knowing they could only get there with high wage economies -  
as we once did.

And they all have three more  
features:

*   They have taxation policies that assist  
    businesses and workers, not unfairly hinder  
    them,
*   They have disciplined populations, many with a  
    police ratio to population less than ours, but far less  
    crime, and
*   They regard their people as human capital  
    where expenditure is necessary investment, not wasteful  
    cost.

And so did we once, when Parliament was  
full of practical people, not university union politicians  
who wouldn’t know a real worker if they fell over one, and  
don’t know how to fill out a simple ‘profit and loss’  
account, or ‘pecuniary interest form’.

If you want  
to know who are the most forgotten people in New Zealand  
today, it is the kiwi worker – and New Zealand First has  
always cared for them.

New Zealand’s Broken Health  
System
------------------------------------

When we formed New Zealand First 30 years ago,  
one of our founding principles was ‘that expenditure on  
health, was an investment’ - our country’s human capital  
needed to be healthy, and if sick, medically treated as fast  
as possible.

In the next three years we are going to  
set up a single health system – where need, not race, is  
the priority.

To do that, we’re going to  
reprioritise government expenditure, provide funding  
increases for primary health care, and reassign wasted  
resources to urgently deal with hospitals and waiting  
lists.

We are going to stop $29 billion plus on  
Auckland Light Rail which will not work, and spend it on  
items like Emergency Departments and residential care for  
the aged. And we are also going to use savings from wasteful  
pet projects to get the specialist medical staff, so that  
our medico-patient ratios are again first world, not third  
world.

And we know that we will only get essential  
frontline staff if we pay them properly – and pay them  
properly we will.

And as a remit at our conference  
yesterday said, Pharmac was set up so politicians could  
dodge being held accountable. New Zealand First believes  
that New Zealand has long had inferior first world  
pharmaceutical delivery. All first world international  
comparisons prove that, we are at the bottom of the OCED for  
access to medicines, and the eight plus years delay to get  
approvals is simply a national disgrace.

All the other  
political parties believe in the Pharmac model, we don’t,  
because we don’t believe in fobbing off political  
responsibility.

So we are going to take money from  
wasteful expenditure, to provide innovative lifesaving  
medicines quickly, and provide timely access to patients to  
developed high cost treatments.

We are going to  
provide the new model an extra $1.3 billion on top of the  
present $1.2 billion “existing underbudget”.

New  
Zealand First is the “Health Party”.

New  
Zealand’s Failing Education System
----------------------------------------

There is much  
going wrong with our education system.

Education  
Minister Tinetti was recently crowing about student  
attendance rising to 60%. It didn’t occur to her, for that  
to happen the best schools must be at least 90% and the  
worse schools for attendance at 30%. That’s 60,000 plus  
truant pupils in any given day, a tsunami of educational  
failure at a personal and national level and billions of  
wasted taxpayers’ dollars.

New Zealand First’s  
policy is to fix that, as common-sense politicians once did,  
as long ago as 1877 when they made education  
compulsory.

We will not get back to having a leading  
economy without first fixing our education system.

We  
were at the very top of the education world once. And we  
didn’t get there with some of the stupid education  
policies we have today.

But once we have properly  
trained our young, we must pay our workforce competitive  
incomes to keep them here.

New Zealand taxpayers are  
paying a fortune to train too many young people who then go  
overseas and benefit, for free, some foreign  
economy.

New Zealand First has nothing against an  
“OE” (Overseas Experience).

But New Zealand First  
is most certainly against “OF” – that is, a skilled  
workforce “Overseas Forever”.

New Zealand First is  
the “Education Party”.

Taxation – Towards An  
Export Power House
------------------------------------------

It is said that there are only two  
things certain in life - “death and taxes”.

If we  
look at our once great past, and today’s ‘small country  
economic world leaders’, they have one thing in common -  
they are export power houses - like New Zealand once was.  
Iceland, Norway, Finland, Singapore, and Ireland are small  
countries maximising added value before exporting,  
maximising IT, maximising education, and ensuring that they  
pay their workforce high wages.

And we must again  
follow that prescription with taxation policies that assist  
that outcome.

That’s why we are going to bring in  
tax incentives, to promote added value before exports, IT,  
and productivity.

That’s why we are going to ensure  
that the tax income brackets are adjusted to inflation. That  
is New Zealand First’s policy.

We know we can both  
lower taxation on business and give higher wages for  
workers, with our polices to rapidly double our Gross  
National Product.

And for those that say it can’t be  
done, we point to countries like Singapore to refute their  
myopic ideological mindset. We will announce details over  
the next two months.

In this cost of living crisis, we  
are going to Exempt Basic Foods, like fresh food,  
vegetables, meat, dairy, and fish, from GST.

We  
challenge the tax purists, to explain why other First World  
countries can do this, and we can’t.

New Zealand  
First is the “Sound Economics Party”.

Law and  
Order
---------------

Three days ago in Auckland, sadly, two innocent  
victims lost their lives, police officers were injured, and  
ten others were hospitalised. The offender was shot by the  
police - a tragedy for his family.

What’s going  
wrong with law and order in this country is best described  
by the Police Commissioner’s comment who said that the  
offender - ‘had not breached his Home Detention  
conditions’.

Ladies and gentlemen, he got hold of a  
shotgun and right there was a massive breach. And if we  
can’t understand as a country what constitutes illegal  
behaviour, then we are destined to see it repeated over and  
over again.

But even worse, how did someone sentenced  
for choking someone almost to death receive just five months  
home detention?

How was he able to get home detention  
and access to a firearm if he was assessed as being “a  
threat to others”?

Our courts are failing us with  
these soft sentences that put community safety last, and  
offender’s rights and excuses first.

These judicial  
failures need an inquiry - just like all those police  
officers who now have to be stood down and questioned just  
because they did their job and shot someone who was shooting  
at innocent people and them.

We want justice and  
common sense returned to our country.

New Zealand  
First’s says anyone who is a threat to the safety of our  
community shouldn’t be on our streets.

Ladies and  
gentlemen, the other parties are shouting ‘law and  
order’, much like a drunk person leaning against an  
evening lamppost at night – for support not illumination.  
All the other parties on the right, had a policy of ‘catch  
and warn’, and on the left, have a policy of ‘catch and  
release’.

They have a record of having frozen police  
budgets, closed over thirty police stations, and cutting  
frontline police numbers.

How is that being ‘tough  
on crime’?

Only one Party has a record of investing  
in our police – New Zealand First. We got a massive  
increase in frontline police numbers, not once but twice,  
when we were in government. And on law and order we are the  
only party whose promises you can trust – not on what we  
say but on what we have done.

New Zealand First  
will:

1.  Designate gangs as terrorist organisations  
    – like Western Australia and Queensland;  
    and
2.  Establish a dedicated gang prison to minimise  
    prison recruitment of non gang members.

Most  
importantly, to address the causes of crime we have policies  
to address real needs – such as enforcing compulsory  
education, making housing including public housing  
affordable for ordinary families, make health care available  
for people who need it, and getting people, who have spent  
years on the dole, back to work.

And something else.  
Crime, whether its “gang collar, blue collar or white  
collar”, we will treat the same. New Zealand First is the  
only party that has had the courage over the decades to  
expose white collar crime when the rest would  
not.

Remember the vitriol that has come our way from  
the establishment when we said white collar crime is going  
on and we are going to prove to you what is happening –  
and prove that to you we did.

New Zealand First is the  
“Law and Order Party”.

The Attack On Our  
Democracy - Separatism
------------------------------------------

The first New Zealand election  
was in 1854, Māori voting was added in 1867, and women got  
the vote in 1893.

As Abraham Lincoln said,  
“Democracy is government of the people, by the people, for  
the people”. That means one person, one vote, and every  
vote of equal value.

Secretly, before 2020 and after,  
the Labour, Greens, and Māori Party have launched a  
full-scale attack on the essence of  
democracy.

Ordinary Māori want safe affordable homes,  
ready access to health care, educational escalators for  
their young, and first world wages. That is what all  
ordinary New Zealanders want, and it’s those four policies  
that New Zealand First is committed to delivering on – no  
matter what race you are, what church you are, what gender  
you are.

Yesterday, in her insightful speech Casey  
Costello set out the numerous racist attacks on our  
democracy.

And the revisionists agenda is to force all  
government and quasi-government agencies into  
compliance.

Ordinary Māori never asked for any of  
this. Only the elite Māori have.

There is no historic  
justification for them, which is why they have set out to  
re-write and reconstruct history.

To get to where  
these politicians want to take us, they deal in lies,  
including these four claims:

*   That European  
    arrival ruined the peaceful paradise of Māori,
*   That  
    the Treaty saw Māori begin a partnership with Queen  
    Victoria,
*   That the Treaty was not about Māori  
    ceding sovereignty,
*   That the Treaty meant Māori  
    ‘self-government’

Stop for a moment and ask  
yourself, whether you’re Māori or non-Māori, can any of  
those four statements be remotely true?

*   Every Iwi  
    history of the inter-tribal wars makes the ‘Māori Garden  
    of Eden’ a complete myth. Look at the local Māori history  
    here.
*   If no one in Britain or the UK or the whole  
    British Empire was in partnership with the Crown on the 5th  
    of February 1840, then how could it be constitutionally true  
    that Māori were, two days later?
*   The fact is Māori  
    ceded sovereignty to the Crown when they signed the Treaty.  
    The Chiefs back then said so, as did many leading Māori  
    later, including Sir Apirana Ngata, Sir Maui Pomare, and Sir  
    Peter Buck. Yet today’s elite power-hungry Māori and  
    their cultural fellow travelers deny history and  
    fact.
*   All Māori Iwi pre-1840 and well after, were  
    under the control of their ‘Tino Rangatiratanga’. That  
    means their Chief’s word was gospel. If there was back  
    then co-government, which Chief’s word, if different, was  
    gospel?

The elite’s argument does not stand  
the slightest scrutiny. And every ordinary Māori knows  
it.

New Zealand First is the “One Standard of  
Citizenship Party”.

Social  
Engineering
--------------------

Behind closed doors a small unelected  
cabal of opinionated virtue signallers want to “integrate  
gender content into the curriculum”. They want to stop the  
science curriculum being about physics, chemistry, and  
biology, but include sexual and gender education. They have  
no authority to be doing this. They never ever asked  
you.

This election is about stopping them.

The  
government has no place in the nation’s bedrooms - so why  
are our school children, from age five, now being taught  
about ‘relationships, gender, and sexuality’?

New  
Zealand First is going to restore education and stop  
indoctrination.

New Zealand First is the “Common  
Sense Party”.

Caring For Seniors
------------------

In our  
country are about 890,000 people who are seniors, who  
receive Super and enjoy the tens of thousands of shopping  
benefits, plus free travel, that comes from the Gold  
Card.

When over the years every political party has  
attacked seniors and changed the law to harm their incomes,  
one party alone has defended seniors.

In past times of  
economic difficulty, the seniors have been the first one the  
other parties have attacked.

New Zealand First will  
makes sure, as in the past, they don’t succeed.

New  
Zealand First is the “Standing Up For Seniors  
Party”.

Conclusion
----------

In the last two days the  
media have gone back to their 30-year-old question –  
“who are you going to go with?” How many times must we  
tell them that our record means we will never go with  
parties that have racist policies. The last Party other  
political parties want to talk to before Election Day is New  
Zealand First, and the first Party they want to talk to -  
the day after.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most  
critical election in our lifetime.

Under MMP you have  
two votes. One for a local electorate political Party  
candidate, the other for the political Party of your choice;  
the Party Vote. New Zealand First is asking for your Party  
Vote - to keep them honest.

New Zealand is at an  
inflection point and a change in government is critical. But  
it must be for a much better government and not just  
‘it’s our turn now’. You’re entitled to ask them  
“your turn to do exactly what?”

And one thing that  
the last three years has proven is that certainty, common  
sense, and experience, is critical to good government. On  
their own the Labour Party has proven an utter  
mess.

And looking across the political divide ask  
yourself this question, “Is this their first rodeo?”  
Because for many it is. They have never had a Minister  
inside of Cabinet. They will need our certainty, our common  
sense, and our experience.

New Zealand First is a  
Party for ordinary New Zealanders. We understand the  
economic challenges and we don’t have extremist policies  
that have never worked in the history of any  
country.

New Zealand First is the insurance voters  
need to avoid an ideological lurch in either  
direction.

We are a Party that for thirty years has  
put New Zealanders First. Certainty, Common Sense, and  
Experience is desperately needed in New Zealand now, and  
even more so after this coming election.

It’s with  
that in mind that we ask you to get ready, to make a  
commitment, right here right now, to save our  
country.

If you do, the future is  
certain.

Democracy will prevail.

But it is  
‘Now or Never’.

We oppose racist  
co-government.

We oppose their Three Waters take  
over.

We oppose our country’s name being  
changed.

We oppose separatism in policy and in  
law.

We oppose this insidious woke agenda being driven  
by an elite cabal of social and ideological  
engineers.

We support policies - based on need, not  
race.

We support the rule of law - where everyone is  
equal before it.

We support the right of free speech -  
and that means we support the right of New Zealanders to  
say, ‘I disagree’ and not be mandated out of  
existence.

We support the right of New Zealanders to  
disagree with government policy and not be punished for  
it.

And we are never going to work in Parliament with  
any political party whose policies threaten those  
fundamental rights.

We have watched over the last  
three years Labour and its cohorts taking our country away  
from us.

That’s why we are asking you to Party Vote  
New Zealand First.

We’ve got the polices, the grit,  
the experience, and the courage to stop them and rebuild New  
Zealand.

We are asking you to join us,  
and,

“Let’s Take Back Our  
Country”.
