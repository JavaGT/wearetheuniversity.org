**Wise Teachers Will See through Warm Fuzzies**

Teachers are too wise to be deceived by the Government’s repeated attempts to curry favour with them says New Zealand First.

Deputy Leader and Spokesperson for education, Tracey Martin, says a government website hosting students’ memories of teachers who made a difference is just another attempt to make teachers feel good towards the Government.

“It is a cynical attempt to win the teacher vote, following years of attacks on the public education system.

“In an election year the Government suddenly wants to kiss and make up - expect to see more of these warm fuzzies towards teachers.

“Already they have found a massive $359 million of new money for bonus payments for a select few ‘lead’ teachers. What else will be used as election sweeteners?

“For the past five years the National Government has been beating up on dedicated professionals who go into schools each day and do their best for our kids.

“Time and again the Government has criticised teachers saying they are not being held to account for education outcomes, and they don’t care enough.

“How much of the education dollar was spent on this cynical attempt to now raise the morale of teachers they are guilty of demoralising in the first instance?

“Interestingly, the Government is sweet talking our education professionals as three Charter Schools open – schools which have no requirement to have fully registered teachers,” says Ms Martin.
