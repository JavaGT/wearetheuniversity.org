Northland’s Rescue Helicopter Needs Bridge to Government Funding - Peters

  
The problems with the Northland Emergency Services Trust date back a long time and is one of funding for a rural and provincial rescue helicopter and these services need a direct bridge to government funding, says Northland’s new Member of Parliament.

“If we can fund $42 million plus benefits to SkyCity Casino we can certainly provide core funding for rural rescue helicopters,” says the Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“With shrinking DHB funding screwing down Northland’s only emergency rescue helicopter and facing funding pressures from Northland Regional Council, it is unacceptable that this essential service is being forced into sausage sizzle fundraising.

“Its chief pilot and manager is being forced to go cap in hand to funders for a service which transports over 1,000 patients every year. That’s at least three people a day.

“The recent Ebola scare highlighted that this Trust operates the only helicopter in New Zealand certified to carry an isolation pod.

“The Westpac Rescue Trust operates a brilliant service but its main funder is an Australian Bank that is also the Government’s banker. Westpac will only stump up where there is a lot of customer accounts and that is not rural and provincial New Zealand.

“What is happening in Northland reflects the pressures other rescue trusts face outside the main centres and this is why this emergency service must have core funding from the Ministry of Health.

“As Northland’s Member of Parliament this is a major priority for me as is ensuring all rural rescue helicopter trusts in provincial New Zealand are on a solid financial footing.

“That is why my colleague Ron Mark MP visited the Northland Emergency Services on Sunday 29 March, the first day after the Northland By-election,” Mr Peters said.
