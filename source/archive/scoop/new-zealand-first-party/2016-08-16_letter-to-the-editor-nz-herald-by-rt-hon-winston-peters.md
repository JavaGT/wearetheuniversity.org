Letter to the editor, NZ Herald, by Rt Hon Winston Peters
=========================================================

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament for Northland  
15 AUGUST 2016

Letter to the editor, New Zealand Herald, by Rt Hon Winston Peters  
Monday, August 15, 2016

  
Dear Sir,

Your editorial, 15th August, 2016 (We are not immune from seismic shock, A16), states: “he has been touted as a potential kingmaker before every election most of us can remember, but only one election result, 1996, has put him in that position.”

Putting aside the fact that political parties, not one personality, make decisions of this magnitude, your editorial appears to have a scant memory of history.

New Zealand First had the balance of political responsibility in both the 1996 and 2005 elections and has been only 1 per cent off holding the balance of political responsibility in every election since 1996.

In fact, in the last First Past The Post election in 1993 New Zealand First, along with the Alliance, held the balance of political responsibility until National persuaded a Labour Cabinet minister to become the Speaker (Peter Tapsell).

Devoid of the historic facts your editorial has little academic or political value. It is to be hoped that it is not a pointer of lax commentary yet to come.

Yours sincerely,

Rt Hon Winston Peters  
New Zealand First Leader  
Member of Parliament of Parliament for Northland

  
ENDS
