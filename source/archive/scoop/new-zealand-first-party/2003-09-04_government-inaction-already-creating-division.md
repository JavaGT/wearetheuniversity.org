Government Inaction Already Creating Division

Government Inaction Already Creating Division

New Zealand First is concerned that a Zimbabwe like situation is developing in Port Waikato where residents have been told not to walk along the beach or even fish as a result of a dispute over trusteeship.

“People who lease properties are threatened with eviction, not because they are behind in the rent, but because a competing Maori Trust has claimed control,” said New Zealand First Maori affairs spokesperson, Bill Gudgeon.

“The law must prevail on this or we will have another Mugabe threat – ruling by fear.

“This Government has created a division in our country, with one group of people telling ordinary New Zealanders they cannot walk or fish along the foreshore.

“This is an affront to democracy and freedom and is the beginning of further division and disharmony unless the Government takes decisive action,” said Mr Gudgeon.
