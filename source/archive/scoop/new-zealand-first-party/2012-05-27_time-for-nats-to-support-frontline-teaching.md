Time for Nats to Support Frontline Teaching

**Time for Nats to Support Frontline Teaching**

New Zealand First has accused the Government of wasting money marketing educational National Standards instead of helping the frontline teaching of basics such as reading, writing and numeracy.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says the Government is fighting a losing battle in trying to convince the public that cutting 1100 teachers in the Budget is in any way positive.

“Losing that many teachers will have an inevitable flow-on effect as more pupils are crammed into classrooms.

“It will make education much worse for all students whether they are currently succeeding or failing.”

Ms Martin says the Government has shown hypocrisy in the way it is handling teacher cuts.

“We have no objection to retaining current teacher-pupil ratios in Māori immersion schools but that should apply across the spectrum.

“There are many Māori and Pacific Island kids in State non-immersion schools and these measures will do nothing to help their academic outcomes either,” says Ms Martin.
