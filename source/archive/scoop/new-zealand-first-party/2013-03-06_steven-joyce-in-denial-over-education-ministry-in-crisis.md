Steven Joyce in denial over Education Ministry in crisis

**Steven Joyce in denial over Education Ministry in crisis**

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce is delusional over the dysfunctional leadership of the Education Ministry, says New Zealand First.

Mr Joyce claims there are no problems in the Ministry and Education Minister Hekia Parata isn’t to blame for the golden handshake awarded to Education Secretary Lesley Longstone.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says if Minister Parata is blameless for the failed working relationship, then what really went wrong?

“Ms Longstone’s resignation has been a costly exercise for taxpayers, with Prime Minister John Key implying the $267,953 in severance pay is nothing in the scheme of things.

“Plenty of teachers could offer suggestions of where the money could be better spent on education.

“Mr Key and his Government are clearly out of touch, with the Prime Minister appearing to think that he is still working as a money trader with Merrill Lynch.”

Ms Martin says months after Ms Longstone left her role, nothing’s been done to improve a Ministry in crisis.

“Teachers still face on-going problems with the Novopay system while the Government fails to take decisive action to fix the bungled pay roll system.

“The Government’s relentless attack at the heart of education smacks of arrogance,” says Ms Martin.
