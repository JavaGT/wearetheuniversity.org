Student Emergency Unemployment Benefit Needs Restoration—New Zealand First

  
New Zealand First is urging the Government to restore the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students in the upcoming budget.

“At present if a student is not receiving an allowance they face a normal stand-down period if they are unable to get paid employment during the summer break. This is a double whammy for students caught in such a circumstance,” said New Zealand First Education Spokesperson, Hon Brian Donnelly MP.

The logic behind the current policy is warped. It is based on the false assumption that if a student is able to survive during course time without an allowance, they should be able to continue to do so over the Christmas break. This ignores the fact that many such students survive on student loans which are not available during non-course time.

“If this Government is truly committed to removing unfairness, it will restore the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students in the budget,” said Mr Donnelly.
