Prison Or Brothel? Asks Nz First Mp

New Zealand First corrections spokesperson Ron Mark says Paparua prison near Christchurch appears to be run more like a disorganised brothel than a penal institution.

This follows the case of a female prison officer who became pregnant to a convicted rapist who was serving time in Paparua for offences including drugging young girls for sex.

“This latest case involving a Canterbury prison is the latest in a series of scandals and it reinforces the need for an urgent inquiry into the management of prisons in the area.

“It also raises the issue of whether women should be employed as prison officers in prisons where dangerous sex offenders are serving time.”

Mr Mark said he was also interested to know why the prisoner David James Shepherd was later transferred to a North Island prison and whether it was so he could be near the woman and her son.

“Somebody has got some explaining to do,” said Mr Mark.
