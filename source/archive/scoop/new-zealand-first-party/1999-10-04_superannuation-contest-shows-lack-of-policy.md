Superannuation contest shows lack of policy for pensions

  
The New Zealand First Leader, Winston Peters, wants to know why the Superannuation Taskforce is spending $42,000 on a competition for secondary school students to give their ideas on retirement incomes.

"Students should not be burdened with worries about their retirement because the Taskforce is bereft of ideas of its own.

"They should be concentrating on preparing for their working life - not worrying about what will happen to them at the end of it because the other political parties won't confront the Superannuation challange.

"New Zealand First will be soon announcing its Superannuation policy which will solve the problem of retirement income once and for all," concluded Mr Peters.
