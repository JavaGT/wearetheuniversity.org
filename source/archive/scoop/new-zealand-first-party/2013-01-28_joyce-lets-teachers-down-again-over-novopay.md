**Joyce Lets Teachers Down Again Over Novopay**

It is time for Government Ministers to become accountable for the Novopay fiasco says New Zealand First Education spokesperson Tracy Martin.

“Steven Joyce has indicated that the Government is likely to stay with the $30 million Novopay system, which is cold comfort for the thousands of school employees around the country who have been struggling with Novopay’s errors for months.

“Education Minister Hekia Parata signed off on the system, which came with no back-up plan, on the advice of her associate Craig Foss who has somehow managed to keep his place in cabinet.

“It’s been a litany of monumental errors for the Government, yet Mr Joyce insists on persevering with what is clearly a nightmare for the education sector.

“Mr Joyce has stated that next week's pay round will be particularly challenging, but that’s not good enough.

“It’s time ministers in this Government started asking the right questions over the botched pay system and became accountable for their decisions,” says Ms Martin.
