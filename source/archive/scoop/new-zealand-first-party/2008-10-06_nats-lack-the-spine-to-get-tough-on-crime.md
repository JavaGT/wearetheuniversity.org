Nats Lack The Spine To Get Tough On Crime

  
The National Party’s plan to abolish parole for some violent offenders is nothing more than hot-air electioneering, says New Zealand First law and order spokesperson Ron Mark.

“Criminals across the country will be rolling on the ground laughing at National’s latest attempt at talking tough on law and order,” said Mr Mark.

“They know that National lacks the spine to actually implement such a policy. Time and time again National members on the law and order select committee have backed off supporting tough measures for criminals.

“They most recently rejected banning the display of gang tattoos, stating it would breach the ‘human rights’ of the gang members.

‘We have put a thousand extra Police on the street, something National has consistently voted against. Voters should look at who actually delivers, rather than who talks the loudest in their attempts to seem tough on crime.

“The public also know that unless New Zealand First has a role in the next Government, they’ll get the usual limp-wristed polices offered by the old parties,” said Mr Mark.
