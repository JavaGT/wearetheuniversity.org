Nandor's cannabis education not wanted or needed

NANDOR’S CANNABIS EDUCATION NOT WANTED OR NEEDED

New Zealand First MP Craig McNair today congratulated the Principals of Tamaki College and Auckland Grammar for speaking out against the efforts of Mr Nandor Tanczos to peddle his pro-cannabis views around our High Schools and Universities.

“Whilst accepting the democratic right of individuals to promote their opinions, I find it very difficult to accept that there is any sound purpose in Mr Tanczos’ actions in this regard, said Mr McNair.

“I am encouraged and delighted that these two Principals have shown that they are not prepared to have pro-cannabis advocates preaching to their pupils and at a time when we are seeing so much evidence of the result of drug usage by our young people. Those in positions of influence and who take a firm line to oppose drug usage, have my full support.” Concluded Mr McNair.
