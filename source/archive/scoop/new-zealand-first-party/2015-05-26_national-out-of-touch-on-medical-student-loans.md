National Out of Touch on Medical Student Loans

The government’s continued refusal to give loans to students studying longer than seven years shows just how out of touch they are, says New Zealand First.

“It takes a third of all medical students up to nine years to complete their degrees,” says New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Barbara Stewart.

“Without access to student loan services, half of those students have no way of paying for their final year of study.

“Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce suggested students take out bank loans, or borrow from private lenders, which is an absurdly unrealistic option.

“New Zealand remains critically short of doctors and under National’s policy this will soon become a crisis.

“This is indicative of National’s short-sighted policy making leading to reduced opportunity for everyday New Zealanders to get ahead,” says Mrs Stewart.
