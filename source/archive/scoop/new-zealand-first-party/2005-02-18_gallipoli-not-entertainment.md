Gallipoli Not Entertainment

New Zealand First veterans’ affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon says that Gallipoli should not be treated as an entertainment venue and pop stars should not be allowed to perform there on the eve of Anzac Day.

“The Prime Minister is right in saying that holding a concert at Gallipoli would be undignified and disrespectful to the dead,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“Gallipoli is a place for people to gather and give thanks to the hundreds and thousands of soldiers who gave up their lives to defend their country.

“We need to preserve Anzac Day traditions and recognise it as a milestone in New Zealand’s history.

“It shaped the character and the destiny of this country and a pop concert is not the right way to commemorate the dead and honour the men and women who fought in the war,” concluded Mr Gudgeon.
