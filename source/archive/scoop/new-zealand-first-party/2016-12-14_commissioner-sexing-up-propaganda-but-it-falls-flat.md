Commissioner ‘Sexing Up’ Propaganda But It Falls Flat

**COMMISSIONER ‘SEXING UP’ PROPAGANDA BUT IT FALLS FLAT**

NZ Super is affordable and no amount of taxpayer-funded propaganda from Retirement Commissioner Diane Maxwell will prove otherwise, says New Zealand First Leader and Northland Member of Parliament Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“In her latest attempt to woo the government and the public the commissioner has wasted thousands of dollars producing an interactive [video series](http://www.cffc.org.nz/video/review-teaser/) featuring Barbie and Ken dolls.

“New Zealanders don’t want rubbishy videos or sexual innuendo about the serious topic of NZ Super – they want facts. The commissioner complains that no one is listening. No wonder.

“New Zealanders should be told NZ Super at net 3.8 per cent of GDP is low by OECD standards and there is no need to increase the age of eligibility as she insists. New Zealand should be able to double GDP by 2050 meaning this ratio will stay somewhat the same, but not if massive immigration carries on.

“In the last 15 years, 87,000 migrants have arrived, not been required to contribute to the economy, and have all been eligible for NZ Super after only 10 years.

“The National government stopped contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund eight years ago, robbing billions from the nest egg designed to cushion a high demand on NZ Super. Now, as PM, Mr English is not saying he will reverse this.

“In summary, for the commissioner’s benefit, GDP growth, fewer immigrants and continuing government contributions to the Cullen Fund will keep NZ Super sustainable.”
