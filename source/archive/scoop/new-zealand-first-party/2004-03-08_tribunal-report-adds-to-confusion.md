Tribunal Report Adds To Confusion

Tribunal Report Adds To Confusion

Rt Hon Winston Peters says the Waitangi Tribunal report on the foreshore and seabed simply adds to the confusion and concern surrounding the issue.

He said the tribunal has mixed mythology, custom, culture and rights of use with the concepts of property title, resulting in contradictory quasi-judicial activism.

“The report fits in with the ill-defined Treaty “principles” pattern established in 1987 and faithfully followed by Labour and National ever since.

“It makes a mistaken assumption that Queen Victoria created a precedent in the then British Empire and entered into a partnership exclusively with Maori via the Treaty. It simply did not happen here or anywhere else!

“However the gravy train riders will be delighted that the report mentions the ‘C’ (compensation) word and no doubt the claims will start coming thick and fast at a cost of millions of dollars to taxpayers.”

Mr Peters said the only logical way to resolve the issue was to firmly establish Crown ownership of the foreshore and seabed on behalf of all New Zealanders and ensure that customary use rights were upheld.
