Doubts Raised Over Charter School Contracts

New Zealand First says the passing of the Education Amendment Bill creating charter schools is a blow to the state education system with no Government guarantee of success.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says it’s ironic the Education Minister asks people to trust her over partnership schools the same day she failed to take any responsibility for the botched Novopay teachers' payroll contract.

“How can the public have confidence in charter schools when the Government tells us they will have similar contracts with similar milestones as Novopay?

“The Ministerial Inquiry into Novopay revealed a dysfunctional relationship between the Ministry and its ministers. Is it any wonder the country has lost confidence in the Government’s ability to successfully hold contract holders to account?

“Charter school supporters claim their system will better educate our children but students will be used like laboratory animals in the Government’s education trial with unregistered, untrained teachers throwing the curriculum out the window.

“How many charter school children will in fact fall through the gaps and end up being thrown back onto the state system with qualified teachers left to pick up the pieces?

“The only ones who will benefit from charter schools are the sponsors who use public money to line their pockets,” says Ms Martin.
