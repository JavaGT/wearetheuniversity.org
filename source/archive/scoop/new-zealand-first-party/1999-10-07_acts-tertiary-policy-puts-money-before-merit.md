ACT’S TERTIARY POLICY PUTS MONEY BEFORE MERIT

New Zealand First claims ACT’s tertiary policy will turn back the clock 100 years and recreate the elitist system of Dickensian England with large numbers of New Zealanders being excluded from higher education, said Education spokesperson and former Associate Minister of Education, Brian Donnelly.

“Richard Prebble, Muriel Newman, and the rest of their political cronies would have been unable to attend university under Act’s proposed system,” said Mr Donnelly.

“New Zealand First’s tertiary education policy attacks the financial burden of student loans and increasing course costs, and is aimed at assisting New Zealand’s young people to make the best use of their talents.”
