Sensible Decision Allows Schools to Be Digital Hubs

**Sensible Decision Allows Schools to Be Digital Hubs**

New Zealand First applauds the sensible announcement from Associate Minister of Education, Nikki Kaye, allowing schools to become digital hubs for their communities.

The Government has now given schools with ultra-fast broadband the option of sharing their fibre connections with their communities.

“Finally a minister in this Government has listened to the select committee’s recommendations and the practical comments from our communities and provided a solution that will go some way toward minimising the digital divide in many areas," says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and IT Spokesperson Tracey Martin.

"The Digital Literacy Inquiry that both Nikki Kaye and myself were part of clearly identified that it is often not the device that adds to the digital divide but the lack of access and affordability to the broadband signal.

“This move to allow other schools to follow the Manaiakalani model of sharing the signal with their students into their own homes should be commended.

“If only other Ministers of this Government would listen as intently and make helpful policy decisions as this young Minister does,” says Ms Martin.
