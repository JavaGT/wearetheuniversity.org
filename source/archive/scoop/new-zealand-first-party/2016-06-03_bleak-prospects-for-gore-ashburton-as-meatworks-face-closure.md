Bleak Prospects For Gore/Ashburton as Meatworks Face Closure

**Bleak Prospects For Gore/Ashburton as Meatworks Face Closure**

The takeover of Silver Fern Farms by a Chinese SOE is likely to lead to the closure of meatworks at Gore and Ashburton, says New Zealand First.

“This will be shattering for workers, the local economies, Mid-Canterbury and Southland,” says New Zealand First Leader and MP for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Documents from the buyer, Chinese company Shanghai Maling, show the Fairton and Waitane plants will be axed.

The Chinese company’s documents are based on information given to them by Silver Fern Farms.

“This is our biggest meat exporter. Under the deal the Chinese company will take the chief executive position – it is a takeover.

“New Zealand First has long warned that New Zealand faces dire consequences when foreign buyers eye profits that will be sucked overseas for their benefits, and have no regard for New Zealanders.

“The victims in this deal will be hundreds of workers at the plants, and the flow-on effect on local town and their economies. The regions deserve better than this.”
