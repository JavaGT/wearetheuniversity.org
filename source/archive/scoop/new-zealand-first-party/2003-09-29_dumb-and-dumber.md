Dumb And Dumber

“A call by Waitakere Mayor Bob Harvey to bolster the minimal policing measures in his town is about as intelligent as his public display of attention seeking through nude swimming,” said New Zealand First Deputy Leader, Peter Brown.

“Mr Harvey, and every Labour Party supporter, knows full well that the police cannot carry out the range of tasks communities expect of them because the Police Minister, George Hawkins, is not strong enough within the cabinet to fight for the resourcing and funding police need,” said Mr Brown.

“Just because this Government has a low commitment to the policing of crime, that is no reason for Mayor Harvey to burden his ratepayers with yet another cost which should be met by central government.

“It is also a rather shabby attempt to prop up his Labour cronies, by taking the heat off their unwillingness to ensure police numbers are increased to the levels demanded by New Zealand First and supported by hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders.

“Policing our communities is the work of a dedicated and professional Police Service and is not the work of council paid weekend warriors or parking wardens seeking to expand their area of responsibilities. If Waitakere City has money to spare it could reduce the rates burden, rather than come up with such a harebrained scheme,” said Peter Brown.
