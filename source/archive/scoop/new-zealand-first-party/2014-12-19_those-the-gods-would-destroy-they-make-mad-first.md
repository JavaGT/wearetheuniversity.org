Those the Gods Would Destroy They Make Mad First

  
New Zealand First says that the new records being set each month in immigration are utter madness.

“The latest figures out today show a new high of 108,838 immigrants in the year to November – it’s a flood and there are no control gates,” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Our hospitals and other health services are reeling under each new blow. Someone surely must see that many of our services will be crippled by net migration of 49,800 in the past year, that over 134 people each day settling in.

“The long suffering taxpayer will be asked to pay more and more, and will end up at the back of the queue when they need treatment.

“There is no sound reasoning behind this. We’ve got a housing problem, particularly in Auckland, yet we are cramming more and more people into the country and this city. They have to live somewhere. Rents will skyrocket even higher.

“This mean and unfair policy that the National government is promoting means New Zealanders come second.

“Worse, still Treasury is predicting that net migration will soon go beyond 55,000 per year.

“Meantime, this totally unfocused policy is doing nothing to change the age demographic of New Zealand.

“It’s long since time to pull back, and look at what we want from immigration. Surely we don’t want an economy based on servicing others?

“We have warned previously about Export Education since the government allowed foreign students to work here. The latest figures prove our point – student visas were up 7400.”
