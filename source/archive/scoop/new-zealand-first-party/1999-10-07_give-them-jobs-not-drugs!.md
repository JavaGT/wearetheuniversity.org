Media Release

7 October 1999

Give them jobs not drugs!

New Zealand First is outraged at Helen Clark's announcement yesterday at a Victoria University student forum, that the Labour Party would condone the use of cannabis.

The New Zealand First spokesperson for Youth Affairs, Hon Brian Donnelly, today said that there is plenty of evidence to show that young people are already struggling to succeed and for Ms Clark to show leniency, at a youth forum, on the use of illegal drugs is clearly irresponsible.

"New Zealand First has for six years clearly stated that a referendum on this issue should be held. This is a serious issue which should, at the appropriate time, be given proper consideration", said Mr Donnelly.

"Our young people need a decent, affordable education. Let's give them a future. Let's give them jobs, not drugs."
