Can’t Pay Teachers To Teach English  
Can Pay For Interpreters For  
Immigrants

The New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters wants to know why Labour’s Ethnic Affairs Minister George Hawkins has thrown another million dollars at a new interpretation service for immigrants.

“This is just another cost of bringing in thousands of new immigrants who can’t speak English. While the Government can’t raise the money to pay our secondary school teachers it has no problem finding millions for secret payouts and the provision of translation services. How can we expect new New Zealanders to adopt our culture and values if they don’t share our language?

“Our education system is being overloaded by non-English speaking migrants. Many of our schools are relying on volunteers to teach English as a second language while some of our children leave school unable to read and write properly Why can’t we pay our teachers to teach our children English instead of forking out on a service that encourages immigrants to remain unassimilated? Is this political correctness gone mad or what,” asks Mr. Peters.
