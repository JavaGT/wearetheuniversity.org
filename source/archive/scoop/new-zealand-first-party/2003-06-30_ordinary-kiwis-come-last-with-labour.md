Ordinary Kiwis Come Last With Labour

  
New Zealand First claims scarce Housing New Zealand resources (746 houses) are being allocated to refugees and recent immigrants while thousands of ordinary Kiwis wait in a never ending queue for the Government to address their housing needs.

“While New Zealand’s borders remain open to floods of new immigrants, those Kiwis on the housing waiting lists will have more than a year before their applications for state housing may be actioned,” Leader Rt Winston Peters said today.

“This is another example of what unlimited immigration is doing to this country – especially in Auckland where the housing problem is the greatest.

“The wave of immigrants is crippling Auckland’s infrastructure. It is creating upward house pricing pressures that lead to ordinary Kiwi families living in sheds and in crowded third-world conditions while refugees receive priority treatment when they arrive at the airport.

“Immigrant numbers must be reduced and New Zealanders placed first for a change when it comes to housing,” said Mr Peters.
