Manufacturing Job Losses a Disaster for Waikato Families

Manufacturing Job Losses a Disaster for Waikato Families

  
New Zealand First is calling for the Government to address high unemployment in the regions.

“The Government is not addressing the lack of jobs, particularly in the regions. In fact, the regions have been neglected in every way by National,” says Asenati Lole-Taylor, Spokesperson for Social Policy.

“Fonterra is laying off 110 workers in Waikato, adding to the 150,000 already unemployed in New Zealand.

“Workers are being laid off, so where is the rock star economy and its benefits for them?

“New Zealand First wants to see inequality addressed in this country, we have a “No Stone Left Unturned” policy to boost jobs within the manufacturing industry.

“It is common sense to introduce a lower (20 per cent) business tax rate for exporters, which will boost our own export market and create jobs with better wages.

“New Zealand First is serious about job creation and we are willing to implement effective policies to support New Zealand families,” says Mrs Lole-Taylor.
