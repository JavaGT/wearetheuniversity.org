Government Ignores Earthquake in Defence Announcement

**Government Ignores Earthquake in Defence Announcement**

The Government’s $20bn Defence Capability Plan ignores the Culverden Earthquake says New Zealand First.

“You’d think being the Acting Minister of Civil Defence would have rubbed off on Minister Brownlee, even if just a little,” says Ron Mark, New Zealand First Defence Spokesperson.

“Yesterday, the Prime Minister said in Parliament that the Kaikoura seabed has changed, yet this government paid-off the Navy’s hydrographic survey ship in 2012. Her replacement isn’t due to about 2019 and we suggest that’s now a priority.

“New Zealand First cannot support defence dollars being soaked up by the Prime Minister’s “Key Force 1 and 2” VIP aircraft masquerading as strategic airlift.

“In 2010, the Deane Report said: “In terms of reduced operating costs for NZDF, the sale of the \[Boeing 757\] aircraft and the acquisition of certain Strategic and VIP Transport services from the likes of Air New Zealand would deliver the greatest VFM \[value for money\]”.

“A far bigger priority is to replace our C130H Hercules, which have the longest air frame hours on earth. These replacements could include aircraft capable of landing and taking off from short austere airfields like Kaikoura with range to Antarctica.

“Another element of concern is this fixation with replacing our ANZAC Frigates when that’s a matter for the 2021 and 2026Defence White Papers and not 2016.

“That is unless is National softening us up to join Australia’s ANZAC replacement, Sea 5000, a project that costs each new Australian Frigate at an incredible $1.47bn each? We can do much better than underwriting Aussie shipbuilders.

“Mr Brownlee’s shopping list raises a number of matters that are not there, like Lead-in Fighter Trainers because National has reneged on regenerating air-combat. And, in light of the recent earthquakes, Landing Helicopter Docks to complement and eventually replace _HMNZS_ _Canterbury_.

“We need to gear up because Culverden has exposed how thin our margins are,” Mr Mark said.
