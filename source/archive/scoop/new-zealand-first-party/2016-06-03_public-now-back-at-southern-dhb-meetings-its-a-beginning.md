Public Now Back at Southern DHB Meetings – It’s a Beginning

The public can once again attend Southern DHB meetings – it’s better late than never, says Ria Bond, New Zealand First List MP based in Invercargill.

“Transparency has been one of the biggest issues with this commissioner-led DHB.

“We’ve been told time and again to trust them, but the public has not been allowed in.

“Hopefully this is a forerunner for a return to democracy for the people of Southland and Otago and they will have their voting rights back, sooner rather than later.

“This is a good first step, but New Zealand First won’t be satisfied until we have a fully elected board,” says Ria Bond.
