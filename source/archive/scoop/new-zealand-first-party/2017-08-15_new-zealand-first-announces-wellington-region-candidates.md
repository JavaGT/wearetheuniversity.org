**NEW ZEALAND FIRST ANNOUNCES ŌHĀIRU CANDIDATE**

Lisa Close has been selected as New Zealand First’s Ōhāriu candidate for the 2017 General Election.

“Lisa works as an advisor for two of our MPs and is well known for her work lobbying to improve government responses to domestic violence”, says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters. “I’m pleased to have her on board for this year’s election.”

“Lisa was directly involved with New Zealand becoming one of the first countries in the world to formally recognise the voice of domestic violence survivors in policy development.

“Lisa was an original member of the Ministry of Social Development’s Domestic Violence Unit. She was a Secretariat for the Glenn Inquiry and has worked with the Family Violence Death Review Committee”

“Lisa has called Ōhāriu home since she arrived in the electorate at age 12 and always knew she would eventually return after working and travelling overseas. She has a deep attachment to the area.

“Lisa will give Ōhāriu voters a real choice with their party votes this election”, says Mr Peters.

“At the last election, New Zealand First achieved 4.8 per cent of the party vote in Ōhāriu – 1,781 votes without standing a candidate. I know we can do much better," says Ms Close.

“It is an important opportunity for me to represent all the people who live in this electorate on the issues that matter most to them and their families, including decent jobs, housing, access to healthcare, education for their children, and to ensure our older citizens are treated with dignity and respect,” says Mrs Meikle.
