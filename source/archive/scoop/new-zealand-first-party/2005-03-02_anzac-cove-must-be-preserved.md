Anzac Cove Must Be Preserved

New Zealand First veterans’ affairs spokesperson Bill Gudgeon says damage to Anzac Cove caused by recent road constructions is a travesty and could ruin an historical site.

An earth-moving contractor is widening a road directly above the cove and dumping earth from the hillside onto Anzac Cove Beach.

“Recent photos of parts of the site under excavation are almost unrecognisable, and Anzac Cove Beach in some places has actually ceased to be a beach because it is covered in dirt,” said Mr Gudgeon.

“Anzac Cove is a sacred, historical site and all efforts should be made to ensure its preservation.

“I would urge the Turkish Government to monitor the damage construction is causing to the area to ensure that this designated National Park does not suffer any long-term damage through erosion.

“Thousands of men on both sides lost their lives on the sands of Anzac Cove Beach.

“The construction of a new road to attract more tourists should not outweigh the significance this world heritage site holds for those who wish to honour and commemorate these men,” concluded Mr Gudgeon.
