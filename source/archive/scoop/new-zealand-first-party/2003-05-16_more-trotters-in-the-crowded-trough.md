More Trotters In The Crowded Trough

More Trotters In The Crowded Trough

New Zealand First says Helen Clark is rapidly running out of MPs to promote to ministerial rank as a result of the latest reshuffle - except for Mark Peck who has been thrown on the political scrapheap.

Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters said that the huge Budget surplus has obviously been set aside to pay for the perks of office for all the Labour MPs who have been handed out meaningless new labels at the taxpayers’ expense.

“Dr Cullen forgot to tell the debt-wracked students and the shivering pensioners about the new beneficiaries in Parliament during his Budget announcements. Perhaps Helen Clark was trying to sneak the appointments through unnoticed.”

Mr Peters said the only group celebrating today were the criminal offenders who would be rejoicing over the appointment of Rick Barker to the post of Minister of Courts.

“Rick is such a soft touch he will probably be running a happy hour for prisoners within a week. Revolving doors will be installed in all the holding cells in courts.

“Talk about jobs for the boys and girls. There are so many trotters in Helen Clark’s trough the poor old taxpayers will have to build some more feeding places.

“Mark Peck is a lot more competent than the new appointees. Has he been penalised because he does not come from Auckland or Wellington?” asked Mr Peters.
