Maori Quotas Now To Be Introduced Within Government

  
“ A speech last weekend by the Minister of Conservation, Hon Sandra Lee, amplifies for all to see just how captured the Government has become to the views of Maori radicals”, claims Leader of New Zealand First Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“Minister Lee, in her speech about Maori Development and Conservation, at Lincoln University, said that she wants to have 18% of the staff of the Department of Conservation to be Maori, by the year 2010”, Mr Peters said.

“Perhaps the Minister is intending to ‘press gang’ Maori into service into the Conservation Department in order to meet her demanded targets” mused Mr Peters.

“This most blatant form of discrimination, speaks volumes for her commitment to ensuring the needs of the taxpayer are met in the most efficient and effective manner”, said Mr Peters, and suggests that everything is fine, just so long as Maori are employed in numbers she has pre-determined”.

“Well I have news for Hon Sandra Lee” Mr Peters said, “and that is, the vast majority of New Zealanders do not accept that employment opportunity should be based on the colour of ones skin or who your mum or dad were.

New Zealanders abhor this form of quota discrimination and will not accept it ”, concluded Mr Peters.
