Chinese Agent Says Foreign Speculation Rife in Housing Market

A Chinese real estate agent has confirmed that many foreigners buying in the Auckland housing market are doing so solely for profit, says New Zealand First.

“The agent contacted us saying ‘pure speculation’ is driving purchases of houses and land in Auckland,” New Zealand First Leader and Northland MP Rt Hon Winston Peters said during a guest lecture at Lincoln University this morning.

“The agent said many foreigners did not pay tax, bought and sold through their own circles and would sell in bulk and abandon New Zealand if there was a downturn in property values.

“The agent also points to immigration turning Auckland into a ‘ghetto’ and wrote: ‘The immigration policy has to change and you have to fight on’.

“There are parties in Parliament today and many commentators belatedly showing concern over the adverse effects of mass immigration on New Zealand’s economic and social health.

“Not so long ago they all thought this was a thoroughly good idea and labelled anyone opposing their view as racist and xenophobic.

“The truth is there is now artificial competition for rentals, home ownership, jobs, hospital beds, places in classrooms and lecture halls.

“National has opened the door to mass immigration in a desperate attempt to boost the economy. Worse, they claim that as some sort of achievement.

“In the words of the Chinese real estate agent Auckland is now a city of ‘ugly, cheap signages at every corner’.

“He adds: ‘It is not the Auckland my family and many other Chinese families worked so hard to migrate to. With the overflowing of low quality Chinese immigrants rampaging Auckland, not only is our culture suffering an unrecoverable damage, many qualified immigrants are hesitating to move to New Zealand’,” says Mr Peters.
