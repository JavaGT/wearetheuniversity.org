Peters Questions Population Figures

Peters Questions Population Figures

Rt Hon Winston Peters has questioned the accuracy of the claim by Statistics New Zealand that this country’s population will reach four million this week.

The New Zealand First Leader claimed today that the four million figure was probably reached a long time ago because of the number of overstayers here, illegal immigrants and people changing their status after they arrive from overseas.

“The only immigration record kept is a card filled in by the person arriving.

“There is no way of checking the card for accuracy and if the individual later applies for residency, or enrols as a student, the figures are not amended accordingly.

“With thousands of people pouring into the country every month, the figures can become easily distorted and there is no way of correcting them.”

Mr Peters said the lax immigration system meant that no one, least of all the Government, had any real idea about how many people were in New Zealand.

“The situation is disgraceful. There is a population explosion of foreigners and the Government is allowing it to happen without mandate and without thought.

“Each time we question the Immigration Minister about the numbers she gives a different set of figures, which proves the situation is out of control.

“Our social, economic and physical infrastructure cannot cope with the population increase, particularly in Auckland, and if immigration is not curbed the problems will become insurmountable.
