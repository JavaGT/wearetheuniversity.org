Champion for Seniors Petition Presented
=======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand First Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_First_Party)**

New Zealand First List MP  
19 February 2019  

New Zealand First MP, Jenny Marcroft has tabled a petition with over 13,000 signatures to Parliament to establish a Commissioner for the Elderly to ensure our seniors are protected. This petition had been spearheaded and presented by media personality, Mark Sainsbury.

“I am pleased to table this petition on behalf of thousands of concerned New Zealanders. This petition appeals for a Commissioner to champion the rights of the elderly in the same way the Children's Commissioner advocates for young people,” says Ms Marcroft.

“I understand that many have had terrible experiences and some of the stories which I have heard have horrified me.”

Mr Sainsbury’s crusade began when a listener told him about how she believed her father was being neglected in his rest home. A flood of similar allegations followed leading him to believe that something more needed to be done. Mr Sainsbury has listened to numerous anecdotes of elderly abuse and neglect across the country on his talkback show and decided to take action.

“I am delighted that Mr Sainsbury, who has advocated for seniors so passionately, has empowered me to present this petition,” Ms Marcroft added.
