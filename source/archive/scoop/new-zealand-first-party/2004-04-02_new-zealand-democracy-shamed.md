New Zealand Democracy Shamed

The resignation of British Immigration Minister Beverly Hughes after misleading the house about exposed lax controls allowing migrants to enter the country with forged papers, show that Britain has a performing democracy and New Zealand does not,” said New Zealand First Leader, Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“The New Zealand Labour Party has an appalling track record since being in power for misleading the house over immigration issues and continues to allow hundreds of people to remain in our country on false passports claiming refugee status.

“The refugee legal aid is a “gross misuse” of taxpayers’ money as according to the Refugee Status Appeals authority only 3 per cent of cases are genuine.

“The Government continues to defend them in the name of the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Refugee. What about the rights of New Zealanders?

“Already we have suspected terrorists in the country who should have been immediately turned away for arriving with a false passport and previous convictions. But in Zaoui’s case, 16 months and over two hundred thousand dollars later, he is still here.

“The New Zealand Labour Party has a lot to learn about running a properly functioning democracy where Ministers are accountable to the public to front up and tell the truth.

“Immigration is set to be a key issue at New Zealand’s next election and it looks like Britain will be following suit,” said Mr Peters.
