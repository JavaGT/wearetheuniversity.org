Is National Looking to Slash P3k Orion Aircraft Numbers?

**Is National Looking to Slash P3k Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft Numbers?**

New Zealand First has lodged written questions to the Minister of Defence following claims in _[Defense News](http://www.defensenews.com/articles/embraer-responds-to-new-zealand-rfi-for-airlift-surveillance-aircraft)_ that the government is in advanced talks with Embraer for its KC-390 transport aircraft and fewer aircraft to replace the Air Force’s P3K Orions.

“Is the government telling industry that instead of the six maritime patrol aircraft we have, they only want two?” says New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Defence Spokesperson Ron Mark.

“That’s because these are the numbers Embraer is talking about publicly – five transport aircraft and just two aircraft to patrol [the largest zone on earth](http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj248WK-87QAhXJmJQKHS98DEYQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.victoria.ac.nz%2Fhppi%2Fcentres%2Fstrategic-studies%2Fpublications%2Fstrategic-briefing-papers%2FMariSurv.pdf&usg=AFQjCNH2BeTtQJhdQHP1Yu77hi245-ElhQ&sig2=1BbVrz8VdPkL0SQ6Vvsgug).

“Taxpayers also deserve to know why Embraer’s CEO of Defense & Security, Jackson Schneider, told _Defense News_: ‘I think they \[New Zealand\] are very interested in the KC-390 … We are in advanced talks with New Zealand (but) we are not negotiating contracts at the present time’.

“Then, just a few paragraphs later, we read that our government has asked Embraer to develop a Maritime Patrol version of its new E190-E2 airliner. What the heck? That’s from Embraer’s Defense & Security’s senior vice-president Fernando Ribeiro de Queiroz.

“There is no Request for Proposal for the Hercules replacement to base ‘advanced talks’ on. As for converting its new E190 airliner, it ‘only cost’ the US Navy about US$4b to convert the B737 into the superb P-8 Poseidon.

“The KC-390 looks promising but it has only just received provisional certification. Frankly, after the NH90 and seeing the problems Airbus is still having with the A400M Atlas, just for once, can’t we be at the cutting edge and not the bleeding edge?” says Mr Mark.
