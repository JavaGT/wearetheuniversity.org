Supergold Cardholders Losing Choice on Ferry Route

**Supergold Cardholders Losing Choice on Ferry Route**

A New Zealand ferry operator will have to refuse SuperGold cardholders as passengers while the National government continues to support a foreign-owned monopoly, says New Zealand First.

“SuperGold cardholders are being denied a choice on the Auckland to Waiheke service” says New Zealand First Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters.  
“It’s unfair but Kiwi company Explore Group has no alternative but to stop carrying SuperGold cardholders as the government will not allow the company a share of the SuperGold Card subsidy.  
“For the past four months Explore has been carrying SuperGold passengers at their own expense.  
“But the Fullers Waiheke Ferry service receives the full payment of $1.5 million for carrying SuperGold passengers despite many now travelling on Explore.

“It is only fair that Explore Group receive their proportionate share of the $1.5 million allocation.  
SuperGold cardholders spoke out for a fairer distribution of the existing subsidy at the Auckland terminal today.

“Why should SuperGold cardholders be restricted in their choice of transport service and timetable when other New Zealanders are not?

“It’s ironic that the very government that is refusing to hold up the integrity of the card has a Minister for Senior Citizens.

“Successive Ministers of Transport have been stalling and extending the end date for their own review of the transport subsidies. They are avoiding decision making, a hallmark of the National government.

“National has no problem finding money for South Canterbury Finance, Rio Tinto and now SkyCity casino, yet it is stalling on a pittance.

“New Zealand First is calling on the government to work for SuperGold cardholders in good faith and start with delivering them a choice on this route.”
