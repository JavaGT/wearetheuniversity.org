**NZ Defence Force Must Be Deployed to Help Farmers**

New Zealand First has been advised by farmers in earthquake affected North Canterbury they urgently need workers and supplies to help them get back on their feet, says New Zealand First Primary Industries Spokesperson, Richard Prosser.

“We are now calling on the government to deploy the NZ Defence Force to assist with bringing in farm supplies and the task of getting the inland road opened for stock trucks.

“Even before this earthquake, North Canterbury was recovering from several seasons of drought.

“Farmers require stock trucks into the area to get stock to market or to other farms. Drystock farmers are also desperate to get calves in because that’s next season’s income for them and the clock is ticking.

“NZ First is writing to the Minister of Civil Defence requesting the New Zealand Defence Force is deployed as soon as possible to help affected farmers,” Mr Prosser said.
