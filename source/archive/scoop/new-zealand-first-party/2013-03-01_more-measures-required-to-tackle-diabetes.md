**More Measures Required To Tackle Diabetes**

New Zealand First says our fast-food mentality and over-consumption of sugary drinks must be tackled if we are to reverse an impending diabetes epidemic.

Health spokesperson Barbara Stewart says a University of Otago study which found 19 per cent of Kiwis over the age of 15 had a glucose metabolism disorder which often leads to diabetes made for grim reading.

“The terrible statistics in the report are a clear warning that urgent action must be taken to curb the impending explosion in the rate of diabetes.

“We need to change our take-away mentality, our obsession with sugary drinks, and get tough on companies loading fat and sugar into food and drink products.”

Mrs Stewart says more preventative diabetes measures are also urgently required.

“Green Prescriptions are a good start but are not the full answer.

“There needs to be a full national strategy to tackle our burgeoning obesity and diabetes epidemics, including a national diabetes screening programme.

“The cost of establishing coordinated strategies and screening programmes would quickly be recouped through the massive health savings it would generate,” says Mrs Stewart.
