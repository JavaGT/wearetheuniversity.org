**Review Unfair Decile-Based Funding System – NZ First**

New Zealand First is calling for the Government to review its flawed school funding model which is hampering the learning needs of some students.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin says students at decile 3 to 10 schools are handicapped by the current decile-based funding system.

“Just because the neighbours are wealthy does not mean some students inside higher decile-rated schools do not need extra support.

“We want to more fairly re-distribute funding so struggling students at all schools can get the help they need.”

Ms Martin supports the announcement this week by the Education Review Office to remove decile ratings from individual school’s ERO reports.

“The decile rating system has always been for internal funding calculations but has mistakenly been interpreted to suggest the quality of a school and its educational outcomes.

“The removal of the rating from the front of these reports will eliminate preconceived stigma attached to areas facing financial challenges,” says Ms Martin.
