Count Me In Programme Masks Neglect of Māori Youth

  
The funding of the Count Me In programme announced yesterday masks the government’s continued failure to act to curb Māori youth unemployment.

“Māori youth unemployment has risen 40 per cent under this government. Forty-six per cent of Māori leaving school without any qualifications are unemployed,” says New Zealand First Māori Affairs Spokesperson Pita Paraone.

“The government’s response is a programme that will reach only 2000 Māori and Pasifika students over two years.

“At the same time, they have removed the $1 million programme supporting iwi engagement in education, and a further $1 million is axed from the Engaging Priority Families programme.

“There is clear link between engaging iwi and whānau with education and future employment opportunities, yet this government has chosen to mask the greater issue by focusing on only 2000 students.

“Only through sustained, targeted investment for all Māori education will Māori unemployment rates fall,” says Pita Paraone.
