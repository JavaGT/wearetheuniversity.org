Child Poverty Ignored by Government
===================================

Child Poverty Ignored by Government  

  
The April 1 changes from the National Government do not go far enough to stop Kiwi children living in poverty.

“A raft of changes from the government to ‘help families get ahead’ have been announced but none focus on the thousands of New Zealand children living in poverty,” says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Family Affairs Barbara Stewart.

“The latest figures show the number of children living in poverty has grown by 20,000 to 285,000.

“Just recently the government had the chance to make an impact but chose to vote against the Food in Schools Amendment Bill,” says Mrs Stewart.

“New Zealand First supports our most vulnerable and that is why we support an exemption from GST for healthy foods to help low-income families feed their children.

“More than words are needed from the government. Real action, directed at alleviating child poverty is needed. Let us hope we see something more in the upcoming budget before it is too late.”
