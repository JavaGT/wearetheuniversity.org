End ‘Ethnic Precincts’ – Peters

End ‘Ethnic Precincts’ – Peters

New Zealand First is calling for migrants setting up businesses in New Zealand to acknowledge they live in an English speaking country.

Rt Hon Winston Peters says the findings of a Massey University study about ethnic signage show that migrant business attitudes must change.

“Migrants who come to New Zealand are supposed to arrive with an understanding of the English language but many are failing to use it to integrate into this country.”

Mr Peters says the study found areas of New Zealand have become ‘ethnic precincts’ where migrant businesses use foreign language to advertise – often alienating themselves from the wider community.

“Businesses should be able to display ethnic language but not to the point where there are no translations available to the wider English-speaking community.”

Mr Peters agrees with Auckland Chinese Community Centre chairman Arthur Loo, who said it ‘would be nice’ if migrant businesses made the effort to translate their signs into English.

“Sadly the New Zealand urban scenery is cluttered up with some of the worst examples of American advertising indulgence.

“It does nothing to enhance the natural character and nothing to distinguish downtown Auckland from downtown Hong Kong,” says Mr Peters.
