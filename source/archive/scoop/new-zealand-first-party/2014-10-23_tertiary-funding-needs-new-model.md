Tertiary Funding Needs New Model

Tertiary Funding Needs New Model

The government is failing young New Zealanders by allowing the cost of tertiary education to spiral out of the reach of many, says New Zealand First.

Education spokesperson Tracey Martin is calling for a rethink about funding of tertiary education so young Kiwis can gain the skills the country needs.

“The Prime Minister plans to hold job fairs in Australia in an attempt to address skills shortages here, but the government is ignoring the fact that high student debt is deterring young people from studying.

“New Zealand First is committed to a step-by-step programme to return New Zealand to education free of fees.

“During the election campaign National candidates argued that if a doctor can earn a higher salary than a taxi driver then why should the taxi driver pay for the doctor’s education through taxation.

“The common sense answer is that one day that taxi driver may need to go to a public hospital for medical treatment and they will not have to pay,” says Ms Martin.
