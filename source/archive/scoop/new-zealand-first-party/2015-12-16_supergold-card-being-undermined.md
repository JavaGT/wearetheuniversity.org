Supergold Card Being Undermined

Supergold Card Being Undermined

New Zealand First is appalled that the government is continuing to undermine the SuperGold Card.

“This sly, underhand move continues National’s attack on free public transport, which is used by hundreds of thousands of over 65s,” says New Zealand First Leader and Member of Parliament for Northland Rt Hon Winston Peters.

“In six months’ time, 1 July, 2016, the SuperGold Card is being deliberately sidelined from free off-peak public transport wherever smart cards are used – smart cards like Auckland’s HOP card and Wellington’s Snapper card.

“All users will have to buy the smartcard – and if they travel they will be forced to buy a new card in each region.

“The attack on the SuperGold Card has been under way in Auckland for two years with Auckland Transport forcing people to abandon their card and buy a HOP card. Tomorrow the cost rises – it will be $10 for the card and $10 for credit, but the credit will never be used because travel is free from 9am.

“Paying for a card goes against the logic and rationale of the SuperGold Card – which was to allow Seniors to occupy empty seats in off-peak hours.

“National is deceitfully undermining the card’s value and using it to cut government costs. First it froze the travel costs for six years and now it is allowing local councils to artificially impose their costs.

“Just as the population of Seniors rises, as the general population rises, National has put a lid on funding and pushed responsibility on to regional councils.

“Not one Cabinet Minister is standing up for the SuperGold cardholders - including the Minister for Senior Citizens, which begs the question, why ‘under National would you have one?’. Such is their lack of enthusiasm for it.

“We suggest SuperGold cardholders fight back and refuse to buy any smartcards for public transport. After all, local government elections are next year and the nationwide elections not long after.”
