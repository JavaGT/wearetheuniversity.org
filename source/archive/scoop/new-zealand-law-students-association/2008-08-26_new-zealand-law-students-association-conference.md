FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

New Zealand Law Students’ Association Conference  
2nd-6th September 2008

The University of Auckland is proud to host a gathering of New Zealand’s best and brightest law students for the most prestigious event on the law school calendar – the New Zealand Law Students’ Association’s annual conference, which takes place next week.

Over several days, students representing each law school will compete for titles in one of four competitions – Bell Gully Mooting, Russell McVeagh Client Interviewing, Minter Ellison Rudd Watts Witness Examination, and Buddle Findlay Negotiation. They will be judged by a number of respected adjudicators, including learned Justices Chamber and Winkelmann. Competition winners will go on to represent New Zealand at an international level.

An education forum will be held as part of the Association’s commitment to extra-curricular development, featuring speeches from practitioners and academics who are experts in their fields. The Association also holds its annual council meetings during the conference.

Social events are another highlight of the week, giving students the chance to experience Auckland at its best. Conference organisers have planned a pub-crawl, a cocktail party, and a competition of a different sort – an Amazing Race-inspired journey around Waiheke Island in Jeeps! The crowning event of the Conference will be a black tie dinner on Saturday 6th September at Hopetoun Alpha, which will be attended by Governor-General and University of Auckland Law School alumni, the Hon Anand Satyanand.
