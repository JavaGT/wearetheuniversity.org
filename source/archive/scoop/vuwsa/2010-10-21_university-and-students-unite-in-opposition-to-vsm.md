Wednesday, 20th October 2010 Joint Press Statement Victoria University of Wellington and the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association (VUWSA)

University and Students Unite in Opposition to VSM Bill

Victoria University of Wellington and its students' association, VUWSA, are uniting in opposition to the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill which could undermine the quality of campus life, vital support services and student advocacy at Victoria.

"Students' associations play a crucial role at all universities in New Zealand. They provide significant and valuable services to our students and those services are at risk under this Bill," said Max Hardy, VUWSA President.

"Representation and advocacy play a key role in ensuring fair-decision making and are a part of our quality assurance framework. Student support services, advocacy, representation, clubs, events and our contribution to major building projects are now at serious risk.

"VUWSA will be put in a position where it can no longer continue its significant contribution to students and to education at Victoria.

"Members of Parliament should consider that not only students, but institutions are asking them to re-consider their support of this Bill."

The change would mean that students could no longer choose whether their students' association is voluntary or universal - instead voluntary membership would be imposed.

"Students' associations provide support services, advocacy and activities for students. To ensure no conflicts of interest, it is essential that many of these services are provided by an independent student body rather than the University, such as advocacy support for students with academic grievances," said Victoria University, Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.

Victoria University of Wellington and VUWSA both provided submissions against the Bill.
