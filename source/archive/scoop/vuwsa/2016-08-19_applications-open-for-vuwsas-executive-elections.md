Applications open for VUWSA’s executive elections

VUWSA is calling for aspiring leaders and those passionate about student life at Victoria to run in the upcoming executive elections.

Nominations for candidates wishing to stand in the 2017 executive opened today at 9am; and nominations close Friday 9 September at 4.30pm.

VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee, says anyone wishing to stand as a candidate in the VUWSA executive should get their nominations in now.

‘We have an incredible pool of talent at Victoria University – dedicated students who are already leaders in their own right at Victoria, and in Wellington,’ Gee says.

‘Standing for the VUWSA executive is a great way to build your leadership skills and make a difference for students at Victoria and in Wellington. We encourage students to come forward now.’

Gee encourages those interested in running to look at the recently launched Strategic Plan 2017-2021, which paints a picture of the future of VUWSA and student voice.

‘VUWSA exists to get the best deal for students. We’re hoping to achieve this in the next five years in a number of ways, including by pushing for a student friendly Wellington.’

As a capital-city students’ association, we should be a leading voice on student issues both within the university and in wider society. We’ve already started this through our campaign for a rental Warrant of Fitness and tertiary discount on public transport for the upcoming local body elections.’

‘Providing Victoria Students and VUWSA members with a choice of candidates is vital. We also hope a pool of high-quality and passionate candidates will drive more students to vote this year.’

VUWSA’s online voting website will go live Tuesday 20 September at 9am and close Thursday 22 September at 4.30pm.

The Association will also hold polling days at Pipitea, Te Aro and Kelburn.
