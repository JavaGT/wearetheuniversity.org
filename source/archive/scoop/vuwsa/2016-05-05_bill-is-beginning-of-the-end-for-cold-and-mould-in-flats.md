**Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill beginning of the end for cold and mould in flats**

The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) welcomes the passing of the Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill (No2) at its first reading.

The new Bill amends the Residential Tenancies Act to require the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to set minimum standards for heating and insulation in rental properties.

‘The Healthy Homes Bill is big news for students. If the Bill can deliver on its promise, this is the beginning of the end for cold and mould in flats,’ says VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee.

‘VUWSA’s positive that heating and ventilation have been included in the new Healthy Homes Bill. We’ve pushed for a rental Warrant of Fitness for several years, and for heating and ventilation to be included in the Residential Tenancies Act.’

‘Students can look forward to finally having decent insulation in their walls after the Government’s previous changes failed to upgrade from the paper-thin 1978 insulation,’ says Welfare Vice President, Rory Lenihan-Ikin.

‘Students have got reason to dream that getting sick from their cold, damp flats might now be a thing of the past.’

In February this year VUWSA submitted on the Residential Tenancies Amendment (RTA) Bill. However, the Social Services Select Committee made no significant changes to the Bill in their April report; and ventilation and heating were not included.
