**VUWSA welcomes students to the academic year with big international line up, including G-Eazy**

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) welcomes students to the beginning of the academic year with an exciting line-up of events – including high-profile, international artist G-Eazy.

Performing on Saturday 27 February at The Hunter Lounge, Kelburn Campus, G-Eazy is an American rapper, songwriter and record producer. His album, These Things Happen peaked to number 3 on the US Billboard 200 in 2014. He released a second album, When It’s Dark Out on 4 December 2015.

‘We have an awesome line-up this year which will welcome both new and returning students in style’, says Jonathan Gee, VUWSA President.

‘Our aim this year has been to welcome students not only to Victoria, but to Wellington city. We’ve sponsored a stage at the Newtown Festival to show that students are an important part of this city.’

Last week OWeek kicked off with a successful Toga Party and David Dallas concert.

G-Eazy will be followed with a long line up of concerts and events for the rest of O-Week, including ‘Afternoon Live’ (in conjunction withSalient) featuring New Zealand artists Nadia Reid, Claudia Jardine and Solomon Crook; an Intergalactic Table Tennis Tournament; Chrome Sparks from the United States; Cyril Hahns from Switzerland; and Newtown Ave Stage.

Around 6,000 free OBags packed full of goodies, including diaries and wallplanners will be given to students Monday to Friday from 11am to 2pm at the Campus Expo, Kelburn Campus. An additional 400 free tacos will be cooked and served to students each day from 12pm.
