Students welcome Vice-Chancellor Appointment

  
Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Rory McCourt today welcomed the appointment of Victoria University’s new Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive Professor Grant Guildford.

“Professor Guilford brings a vibrant vision for Victoria in realising our potential as a leading capital city University, where students and staff work on the big issues facing New Zealand and the world.”

“His challenge will be to craft a unique strategy at Victoria with our many stakeholders, communicate a higher purpose for a university worn down by years of Government underfunding, and put a check on the short-term managerialism that is holding students and staff back. I’ve no doubt he can achieve the very best for Victoria and our students.”

“I commend Chancellor Ian McKinnon, whose strong sense of fairness and regard for process has made this appointment the most robust Victoria has ever seen. The Chancellor deserves much praise and thanks for his commitment to this process.”

“I wish Professor Guilford well, and encourage him to adopt the successful approach of Professor Pat Walsh in working in partnership with the students’ association when he joins Victoria next year” concluded McCourt.

Guilford is the current Dean of Science at the University of Auckland, and will take the up the post at Victoria in early 2013.
