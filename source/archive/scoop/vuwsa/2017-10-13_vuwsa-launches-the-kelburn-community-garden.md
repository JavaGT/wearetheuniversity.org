VUWSA Launches the Kelburn Community Garden

  
In the middle of a busy, inner-city campus, a new garden has appeared.  
The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) has today  
opened the much awaited Kelburn Student Community Garden.

  
This week’s Mental Health Awareness Week theme is Nature is Key – something quite fitting for the occasion, Welfare Vice President Anya Maule says.

  
“Tertiary students do struggle with the stress, both because university expectations and financial pressures. We want this garden to be a place where they can come and sit, or plant, but mostly just have some respite from those everyday pressures.”

  
There are plans to continue growing the garden and tending to the space, with talks already happening about hanging gardens and murals along the walls, Maule says.

  
Victoria University of Wellington staff and students attended the launch on Friday, breaking soil and planting the first lot of vegetables and herbs.

  
A team from Bunnings was also there to help the beginner gardeners how to plant.  
Maule says VUWSA wanted the garden to place created by students for students and enlisted students from STUDiO – the Architecture and Design School students’ group – to design the space.

  
“The hope is that students make this space their own, and enjoy the benefits of being in and around nature, even if it’s only for 15 minutes in between classes.”
