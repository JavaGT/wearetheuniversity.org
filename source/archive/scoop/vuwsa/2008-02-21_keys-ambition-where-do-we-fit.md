Key’s ambition: where do we fit?

  
Wednesday, 20 February 2008

Victoria University Students' Association notes with amusement John Key's ‘ambitious’ plan to slash wages of working New Zealanders.

VUWSA President, Joel Cosgrove said, "It’s all rather funny considering his previous stances of ambitiously increasing doctors fees, ambitiously increasing student fees and now ambitiously slashing wages for working New Zealanders.”

“Helen Clark dismissed a modest 5% pay rise campaign in 2005 as ‘hysterical’ and now Key would like to cut them. The only future that the two main parties are presenting is one of decreasing incomes and the ever increasing cost of living,” added Cosgrove.

“Our average student earns $7,584 and is in debt by $28,838. Any drop in income would catastrophic!” said Cosgrove.

VUWSA represents 22,000 indebted students, who face the brunt of Key’s ‘ambitious’ plan.
