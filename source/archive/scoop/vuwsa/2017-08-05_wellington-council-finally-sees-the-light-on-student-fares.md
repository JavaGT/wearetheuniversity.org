Wellington: Council finally sees the light on student fares
===========================================================

**Press Release: [VUWSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/VUWSA)**

Council finally sees the light on student fares.

The Greater Wellington Regional Council have announced a 25% tertiary student discount on public transport.

This follows years of campaigning by students who have fought for a more equitable fare system, in line with other university cities around the world.

The Fairer Fares campaign gathered wide support from people throughout the region, and produced 1700 submissions supporting student fares in the recent council annual plan consultation.

VUWSA President Rory Lenihan-Ikin says, \"This has been a long time coming, but positive outcomes of this will be long lasting."

"Education should be accessible for everyone, and cheaper public transport for students will take us one step closer to that reality for Wellington."

Consultation opens for the changes on Monday 14 August.

"There was over 90% support for student fares in the last round of consultation, and we expect it to be even stronger this time."
