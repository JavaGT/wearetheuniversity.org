**VUWSA renews commitment to students**

The Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association (VUWSA) is looking forward to an energised and productive year, with a renewal of the values that underpin the organisation.

A new intake of committed Executive members and talented staff have been busy preparing for the start of the trimester and the spectacular Orientation activities that have been lined up.

"The year has got off to a flying start, we have a strong mix of people and skills, and it looks to be a fantastic year," says new President Max Hardy.

"For the past 111 years VUWSA has played a huge role in ensuring students get the most out of their time at University. VUWSA remains an integral part of the student experience here at Vic.”

Hardy acknowledges that VUWSA has had a tested relationship with its members in recent years, but is not daunted by the challenge of restoring VUWSA's credibility with students and the University.

"I’m looking forward to building a sustainable association that students can be proud to be members of," says Hardy.

VUWSA offers an enormous amount of services to students at VIctoria. At VUWSA, we’re focused on independent and professional advocacy, representation and services that make life on campus easier or more enjoyable for students.

“It will be a tough year with most of what VUWSA does under threat, but I am confident VUWSA will prove itself once again as a vital and positive force in the University community,” Hardy concludes.

“The ACT Party’s Bill in Parliament would mean an end to accountable student representation at Vic, a collapse of important welfare and advocacy services and a dramatic decline in the general vibrancy of student life here”

“It happened in Australia, and it resulted in students paying more for less services that they no longer had control over, which is not something we want to see in New Zealand”
