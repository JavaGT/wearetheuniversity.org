**VUWSA to commemorate ANZAC Day**

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Bridie Hood would like to announce that VUWSA has accepted an invitation by the Wellington City Council and Wellington Returned Services Association to lay a wreath to commemorate ANZAC day.

Ms Hood said this year’s exec believe there is a strong mandate from students to support the event.

“Most students do not wish to see ANZAC Day politicized, and instead see it as an important day to remember those who lost their lives,” said Ms Hood.

At least 435 Victoria University of Wellington students lost their lives in both World Wars.

“For VUWSA, we will be especially remembering the hundreds of Victoria students who have served and lost their lives in both World Wars. These conflicts had a profound impact on the student body and we will remember that on ANZAC Day,” said Ms Hood.
