Students welcome plan to introduce tertiary bus fares

**Students welcome plan to introduce tertiary bus fares**

The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) welcomes today’s announcement by mayoral candidate Justin Lester and Regional Councillor Daran Ponter for a tertiary concession on bus fares. Lester and Ponter today announced that if elected, they will extend the current discount for high school students to tertiary students.

VUWSA President, Jonathan Gee, says this is a positive step, and welcomes all other candidates to commit to tertiary bus fares.

‘VUWSA has campaigned for _Fairer Fares_ for several years now. Greater Wellington Regional Council showed their commitment in 2014, but tertiary fares are still not a reality.’

‘Students spend thousands of dollars each year to get an education, but can barely afford the bus to get to class.’

‘By supporting a tertiary discount, candidates are acknowledging the over $1 billion contribution that students make to the local economy each year.’

VUWSA’s Welfare Vice President, Rory Lenihan-Ikin says, ‘If implemented, this policy will mean a $500 saving each year for a student catching the bus two zones everyday.’

‘Having tertiary bus fares would be a huge win for Wellington in becoming a truly student-friendly city, and would align us with other major cities around the world who have student fares.’

‘Tertiary fares are also great for the efficiency of our public transport system, as many students travel off peak’ says Gee.

‘Research shows that almost all students would increase their public transport use if a half price discount was introduced.’

‘If elected, we look forward to these candidates taking all possible steps to implement the discount within the next term. We also hope that other council candidates will commit to tertiary bus fares.’
