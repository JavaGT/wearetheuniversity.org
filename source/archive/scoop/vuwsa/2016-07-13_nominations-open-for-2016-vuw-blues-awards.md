FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Nominations open for 2016 VUW Blues Awards

Now open to receiving nominations, the Victoria University Blues Award is the highest recognition the university gives to people who have, by their sporting achievement or contribution to sport, brought credit to Victoria University.

The Blues are presented in partnership with Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) and Victoria University of Wellington.

Students can self-nominate or nominate another Victoria student across high performing athletes for Sports or Administrator Awards. Those entering the Blues must meet the criteria for the award applied for.

‘These awards give us the opportunity to acknowledge students who have achieved outstanding sporting success through hard-work and dedication, while successfully balancing their academic responsibilities of assignments, tutorials, labs and lectures, says Jonathan Gee, President of VUWSA.

‘Their ability to balance degree-level study with outstanding performance in sports is an incredible achievement.’

In 2015 over fifty students received Blues and top performers received additional recognition for Sportsperson of the Year; Sports Administrator of the Year; Pasifika Sportsperson of the Year; Māori Sportspersons of the Year; Blue Award for Sport.

Victoria University recognised previous students, Conrad Smith and Victor Vito, who later played for the All Blacks. Institutions throughout New Zealand award hundreds of students each year with Blues – the highest sporting accolade an institution can give to students.

Those who enter the Victoria University Blues will receive an email after the nomination closing date of Friday 5 August 2016.

Successful candidates will then be invited along with two guests of their choice to the Blues ceremony on Wednesday 21 September at Victoria University of Wellington’s Kelburn campus.
