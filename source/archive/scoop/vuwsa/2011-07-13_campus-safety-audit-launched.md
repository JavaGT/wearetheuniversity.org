Campus Safety Audit Launched
============================

**FROM** Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association

**Campus Safety Audit Launched by Students’**

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) has launched a Campus Safety Audit, to better understand student perceptions and experiences of campus safety.

VUWSA President Seamus Brady said a recent survey of over 4000 students showed campus safety was a key issue of concern for some groups of students.

“VUWSA is dedicated ensuring the experiences of students at Victoria are positive in all aspects. This includes students feeling like they are studying in a safe academic and social environment. Sadly however, for some students, this is not always the case.”

An anonymous student safety survey is the first stage of the Audit and will be followed by focus groups involving specific groups of student demographics. A physical assessment of areas of concern highlighted by students will then be carried out to supplement the information gathered.

The Audit results will be used to make a series of recommendations for VUWSA and the University to address, as well as providing student input into Victoria’s review of safety and security on campus.

VUWSA is the official representative body of students at Victoria University of Wellington and has been proudly advocating their issues since 1899.
