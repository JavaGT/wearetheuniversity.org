Victoria University Students’ Association:

Hostel Students to Protest “Slumlord”

Thursday, 21st August

Press Release: Victoria University Students Association

PRESS RELEASE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

300 students’ are protesting against Unicomm Hostel owners ING Group tomorrow, after having a year from Hell.

Victoria University Students’ Association President, Joel Cosgrove says, “515 residents aged between 18 and 21 have been plagued by issues including leaking sewage, and are receiving a miserable response from management.”

Cosgrove added, “These young people have been taken advantage of by ING Group, who posted a NZD$16 Billion profit last year, and are forcing them into slum like conditions. Frankly, I am pissed that it could sink this low. Students have tried to resolve these issues are just sick of it!”

Unicomm Resident, Kirstin MacKay, 18 said, \"I woke up to see my skylight missing and a builder staring at me through my roof, I was extremely uncomfortable so went and slept on the couch."

Another Unicomm Resident, Ellen, 18 stated, "Try f\*\*\*ing waking up at 6:30 in the morning to a crane outside your window when you have an exam that morning!!!"

3rd floor resident, Josh McArthur, 18 said, “I’ve spent $10,000 to be in a hostel close to Uni, and that hasn’t helped one bit. The never ending construction has disrupted everything – I wish I hadn’t come here. I am going home to get away from this mess.”

“You’ve got a bunch of people who’ve moved out of home for the first time. They’ve had a horrible entry into independent life and part of that experience has been at the uncaring hands of ING,” says Cosgrove.

“As opposed to dealing with the issue and entering into a dialogue with students, Unicomm are cancelling their open day and cancelling their information stall on campus so that students can’t disrupt it,” says Cosgrove.

“When they say that the buildings are closed for renovations, they don’t mention that students are still being forced to live there with no compensation.”
