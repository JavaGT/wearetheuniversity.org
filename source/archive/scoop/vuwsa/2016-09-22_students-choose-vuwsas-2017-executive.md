Students choose VUWSA’s 2017 Executive  

  
At the end of every year, in Trimester 2, Victoria University of Wellington students choose who the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) executive will be for the next year.

This year’s no different.

As years progress, the new executive stand on the shoulders of those elected before them; feel a sense of pride knowing the Association they represent is now even older – and that they’ll contribute to its history. They’ll help make Victoria’s students’ lives better.

This year’s executive are no different, and neither will the executive of 2017.

Every year the executive adapt to new environments, knowing what was needed back in 1899 when the Association first opened its doors, is different from what’s needed today.

‘This year’s executive and I went into the year with big plans, and built a stronger, more engaged Association,’ says Jonathan Gee, VUWSA’s 2016 President.

‘We also set the tone of the Association for the next five years by finalising a Strategic Plan – reaffirming that the reason we exist is to get the best deal for students.’

As one of the oldest and largest student Association’s in New Zealand, VUWSA’s ideology of students helping students has stood the test of time.

‘Being a VUWSA executive is a big responsibility. I’d like to congratulate the newly-elected 2017 Executive. You will very soon be representing thousands of students, and I know from experience this is a very fulfilling thing.’
