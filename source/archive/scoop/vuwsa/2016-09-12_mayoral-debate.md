Details

VUWSA and the VUW Politics Students' Society are proud to present the 2016 Wellington Mayoral Debate, hosted by Radio NZ local government reporter, Michael Cropp.

It will be a great opportunity for Wellington mayoral candidates to discuss how they'll support students, their contribution to Wellington; and what steps they will take to ensure the student voice is represented at the decision-making table.

With 40,000 students in Wellington, students are a big part of what makes the city tick, contributing about $2 billion to the local economy each year. But at the moment our councils aren’t doing much to return the favour. It’s time we put mayors on the podium, and asked them how they’ll implement student friendly changes to the city if elected – and hold them to it.

Among other questions we’ll be asking Wellington mayoral candidates how they’ll implement Fairer Fares and a Rental Warrant of Fitness if elected.
