VUWSA partners to trial free menstrual products on campus
=========================================================

**VUWSA partners with Victoria University of Wellington to trial free menstrual products on campus.**

From Thursday, August 24, the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) are making free menstrual products available across Victoria University of Wellington campuses.

To remove the stigma around periods and improve accessibility for all who need menstrual products, there will be boxes located at the VUWSA offices at Kelburn and Pipitea campuses, at the Te Aro campus library, and other areas such as the Marae and Pasifika Haos where people can come and grab a pack of four pads or tampons to get them through – no questions asked.

“You can get free condoms from numerous places, which is great, but sex is a choice - getting your period isn’t. It just makes sense there are free menstrual products available for those who need them,” VUWSA Welfare Vice President Anya Maule says.

It will be an honesty box system, where students will be encouraged to take only what they need, to ensure as many people can have access to the products as possible, she says.

“Menstrual products are expensive and a lot of people go without them if money is tight. We hope this project will mean students aren’t skipping classes or opportunities for study because they can’t afford menstrual products.”

Maule says the Victoria University of Wellington staff have been great to work with in getting the scheme off the ground, offering support and the funds to be able to buy the products.

Another big win, is being able to provide Organic Initiative products - a brand which is 100% organic and biodegradeable.

“To know a product is organic and sustainable is really important to students, and we want to be able to support environmentally friendly options where we can,” Maule says.

In addition to free packs of menstrual products, VUWSA has also partnered with Wā Collective to give students access to discounted menstrual cups, for just $15.

“It’s another way for students to cut costs on menstrual products and it’s also another environmentally friendly product option,” Maule says.

Cups can be ordered online at wacollective.org.nz and picked up from VUWSA’s Kelburn office.
