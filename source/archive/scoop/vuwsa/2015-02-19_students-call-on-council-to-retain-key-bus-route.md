Students call on Greater Wellington Regional Council to retain key bus route

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA)

EMBARGOED UNITL 11.30AM 19TH FEBUARY 2015

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) held a public meeting aboard the number 18 bus today to show the value of the bus route to Wellington students.

Students met at the Darlington Road bus stop in Miramar and travelled to the end of the line at Karori Park.

VUWSA President Rick Zwaan says the meeting provided a platform for students to come together.

“It’s important that students are a part of these decisions. Public transport is a large part of day to day life for students in Wellington, and it’s a huge oversight for the GWRC to not recognize that.”

“It’s about ensuring that Wellington is a student-friendly city. Accessibility of an efficient, reliable way to get to class is a big part of that.”

The Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) will be voting on the 25th of February whether or not to scrap the route as a part of a wider redesign of the network.

Zwaan says that this route is vital to Wellington students.

“The 18 connects four Wellington university campuses, the student friendly suburbs of Newtown and Mt. Cook, and Wellington’s eastern suburbs. Thousands of students use this service, it’s an incredibly popular route.”

“The change further discourages students from using public transport through longer commute times and inaccessible transfers.”

Zwaan says the call to Greater Wellington Regional Council to factor in students’ needs is vital.

“It’s time for GWRC to step up and listen to what students are saying. This is a genuine problem that will genuinely negatively impact students’ lives and we’re asking them to respond to that.”
