**Students rejoice as hungover weekend market trips are a thing of the past; VUWSA Launches Vege Market on Campus**

Today the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) launched the first ever midweek fruit and vege market on Kelburn Campus in a bid to improve student wellbeing.

“The weekly ritual of flatmates bickering over whose turn it is to make the hungover trek to the city markets is over” said VUWSA President Rick Zwaan.

“It’s fantastic to have cheap fresh fruit and veges available on campus to students, staff and the Kelburn community.”

“We know that key factors of improving students’ wellbeing, and their academic success, relate to their financial stress and if they’re eating healthy”

The market will run on Wednesdays from 2pm-6pm during the main university trimesters and is located in the Tim Beaglehole Courtyard, just outside the central Hub building on Kelburn Campus.

VUWSA’s Wellbeing and Sustainability Officer, Rory Lenihan-Ikin, organised the market in an effort to make fresh fruit and veges more readily available to students.

“Making it to the existing weekend markets can be challenging with many students working weekend jobs, finishing assignments or simply avoiding the trek up the hill to Kelburn carrying a week’s worth of vege.”

The timing of the market is designed to make it easy for students and staff to stock up before heading home, and attract other Kelburn residents onto campus.

“We hope that the market will add to the vibrancy of Kelburn Campus and help Victoria become a focal point for the wider Kelburn community” concludes Zwaan.
