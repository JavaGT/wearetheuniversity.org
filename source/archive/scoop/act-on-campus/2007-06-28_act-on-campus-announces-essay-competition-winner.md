### ACT On Campus Announces Essay Competition Winner

ACT On Campus today announced that Tauranga Boys College student Cameron Loughlin has been selected as the winner of its inaugural 'Liberal Thinking' essay competition.

Cameron wrote about how high taxation harms the economy as well as individuals. He will receive an all expenses paid trip to Parliament where he will spend a day with ACT Leader Rodney Hide.

Rodney said, \"It is great to see that so many young people are taking an increasingly active role in New Zealand politics. I am looking forward to meeting, and sharing views and perspectives with Cameron."

The 'Liberal Thinking' essay competition received around 70 entries from students across New Zealand. Runner up was Gaylene Hill who will receive an Ipod Nano for her efforts.

The final decision was made by John Ansell; a Wellington based freelance writer, professional speaker and advertiser. John can also lay claim to being the first to dub Wellington's stadium the 'cake tin'.

"The 'Liberal Thinking' competition has been a great opportunity for young people to have their say on the political process that affects them" said ACT On Campus President Mike Bridge. "Politics should be accessible to all young people."
