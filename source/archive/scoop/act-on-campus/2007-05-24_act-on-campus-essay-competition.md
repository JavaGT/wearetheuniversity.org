Earlier this month ACT on Campus launched its first ever essay competition. Interest in the competition has been strong amongst students.  
 

The competition is aimed at secondary school students and is intended to foster debate on issues such as whether the government should protect people from themselves, how much tax should be taken and for what purposes.

The competition close date is fast approaching and students have until June 7 to get their essays in for marking.

The prize for the winning essay will be an all expenses paid trip to Wellington, spending a day in the political life with MP Rodney Hide. The winners school library will also receive a substantial donation of books whilst the runner up will receive an iPod Nano.
