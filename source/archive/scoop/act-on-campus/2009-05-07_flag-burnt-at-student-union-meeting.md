Flag Burnt At Student Union Meeting
===================================

Flag Burnt At Student Union Meeting

  
ACT on Campus spokesman Peter McCaffrey today urged the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) to condemn the burning of the New Zealand flag on university property.

“The New Zealand flag was today burnt by a group of students, including a former student union president, who attended a VUWSA organised Student Representative Council meeting,” Mr McCaffrey said.

“The meeting was scheduled to discuss the recent outrage over VUWSA’s boycott of ANZAC day commemorations.”

“At the meeting, VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle claimed that VUWSA was unable to recognise ANZAC day because there was no mandate from students to do so.”

“Given that students are forced to join students’ associations, no Victoria student has chosen to give VUWSA permission to speak on their behalf. Clearly the association’s actions do not represent student’s views.”

“ACT on Campus calls on the VUWSA executive to reveal its policy on flag burning on university property, or admit that, with no mandate from students, VUWSA is unable to set policy or take a position on any issue without misrepresenting students,” Mr McCaffrey said
