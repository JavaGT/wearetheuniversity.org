Happy Birthday VSM
==================

**Press Release: [ACT On Campus](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_On_Campus)**

**Happy Birthday VSM**

“One year ago today students were liberated from being forced to join self-serving and coercive student unions around the country," ACT on Campus President Hayden Fitzgerald said today.

“Students’ associations that forced students to become members could never truly represent students’ views.

"Freedom of association, a right under the Bill of Rights Act, was the impetus behind the Voluntary Student Membership bill, which broke the cartel-like tertiary students' associations that pressed their captive constituent students into membership and often abused this situation for private or political gain. Supporting and advancing VSM is something that ACT on Campus was proud to promote and a cause which was worthy for fighting.

"We cannot rest on the laurels of that victory though. We must always keep our students' associations accountable, said Mr Fitzgerald.

"ACT on Campus continues to support VSM, and we wish every successive generation of students the very best in upholding the development of a fine and honourable tradition of student institutions around the campuses of New Zealand.

"Happy Birthday VSM!” Mr Fitzgerald concluded.
