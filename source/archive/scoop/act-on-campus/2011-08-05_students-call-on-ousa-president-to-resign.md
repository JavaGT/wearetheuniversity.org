Students Call on OUSA President to Resign

**Students Call on OUSA President to Resign**

Students are today calling on Logan Edgar to resign from his position as President of the Otago University Students' Association (OUSA).

Late last night Logan Edgar, in reference to the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, commented on the Facebook wall of Sir Roger Douglas, saying:

_"Get fucked you dinosaur…just trying to give yourself a legacy because you know you’re getting too old. You should actually debate the Bill with Pete or Grant… you’d get torn to shreds. Cunt"_

In addition, today, Logan Edgar has encouraged students to rip up photographs of the Hon Heather Roy MP, the sponsor of the bill, as part of a protest at Otago University.

"These personal attacks and hateful messages, committed by someone who claims to represent the views of all students, are completely inappropriate and Mr Edgar should resign from his position of responsibility immediately," says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey.

"The vast majority of students at Otago University, and around the country, are not interested in the petty, self-serving nature of student politics,"

"Voluntary student membership will allow students to decide, for themselves, whether to join a student union. This will ensure student unions will focus on providing services that students want and need and provide much-needed accountability that will discourage the type of obscene behaviour that has been demonstrated by Mr Edgar in the last few days," said Mr McCaffrey.

Note:

Due to constitutional changes made by OUSA in 2010, students at Otago University are no longer able to force members of the OUSA executive to resign - they can only lose their position if they resign or face criminal convictions.
