VUWSA Endorse Voluntary Student Membership
==========================================

**Thursday, 15 October 2009, 9:44 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT On Campus](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_On_Campus)**

VUWSA Endorse Voluntary Student Membership

ACT on Campus today congratulated the Victoria University of Wellington Student Association (VUWSA) on supporting Roger Douglas' Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill at the final Student Representative Council (SRC) of 2009.

The VUWSA SRC, which sets official VUWSA policy, passed the motion “That VUWSA actively supports the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill”, committing the VUWSA executive to supporting Voluntary Student Membership and giving a clear signal that students are unhappy with being forced to become a member of the Association.

ACT on Campus Vice President, Peter McCaffrey, said, “Despite numerous points of order, quorum counts, abusive speeches and other stalling tactics from a small number of VUWSA representatives who were able to delay the vote by almost 40 minutes, the vote on the motion was finally held and passed 45-35."

“The passing of this motion is a significant breakthrough for the many students who feel that VUWSA is not receptive to or representative of their views."

"The motion recognises that students don't all speak with one voice and that any organisation that can force people to become members cannot legitimately claim to represent all of its members. We congratulate VUWSA on finally recognising students' fundamental human right to Freedom of Association and look forward to their supportive submission to the select committee on the bill." said Peter McCaffrey.
