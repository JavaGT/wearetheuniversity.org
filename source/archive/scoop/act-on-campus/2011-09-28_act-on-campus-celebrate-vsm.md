**ACT on Campus Celebrate VSM**

ACT on Campus are today celebrating the introduction of Voluntary Student Membership (VSM) with the passage of the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill.

"For almost 20 years, students have fought for their fundamental human right of Freedom of Association", said ACT on Campus President Peter McCaffrey.

"Finally, students will be free to choose for themselves whether or not to join their students' association."

"ACT on Campus would like to thank all those students who have worked towards this goal over the decades, all those MPs who have voted to support our right to choose and Heather Roy and Roger Douglas for sponsoring the bill."

"We look forward to a future of more representative and accountable students' associations for future generations," said Mr McCaffrey.
