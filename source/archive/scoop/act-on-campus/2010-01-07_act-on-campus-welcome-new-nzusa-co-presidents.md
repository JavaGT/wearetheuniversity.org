ACT on Campus Welcome New NZUSA Co-Presidents
=============================================

**Thursday, 7 January 2010, 2:35 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT On Campus](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_On_Campus)**

ACT on Campus Welcome New NZUSA Co-Presidents

ACT on Campus is today pleased to welcome new NZUSA Co-Presidents, David Do and Pene Delaney, to their positions for 2010.

"I, for one, welcome our new student overlords," explained ACT on Campus Vice President, Peter McCaffrey.

"Clearly students are incapable of thinking for themselves and need their views on all the major political issues of the day dictated to them by two unelected apparatchiks. Without NZUSA telling us how and what to think, we'd all be lost and hopeless."

ACT on Campus is also pleased that NZUSA has given up on representing the views of its forced compulsory members and has instead decided to make its key focus for 2010 the defeat of a bill that many of their members support - the Voluntary Student Membership bill.

"Why would NZUSA support students and represent their beliefs when it is much easier and more efficient for them to simply promote their own policies? Students can't leave their student associations or get their money back, so there is no reason for NZUSA to waste time and energy on such activities."

"Representing the views of your members is an outdated idea whose time has long passed. We look forward to another decade of NZUSA's generous and benevolent wisdom and guidance." said Peter McCaffrey.
