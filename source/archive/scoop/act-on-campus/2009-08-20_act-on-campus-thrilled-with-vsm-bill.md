ACT on Campus Thrilled With VSM Bill

**ACT on Campus Thrilled With VSM Bill**

““ACT on Campus is thrilled that ACT MP Sir Roger Douglas’ Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill has been drawn from the private member's bill ballot in Parliament today.

“ACT on Campus calls on all MPs to support student’s right to Freedom of Association, as guaranteed by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” said ACT on Campus Vice President Peter McCaffrey.

"Sir Roger's bill, originally drafted by fellow ACT MP Heather Roy, now Associate Minister of Education, has students up and down New Zealand excited and we hope this bill makes it all the way to law.

“Student Associations are the only organisations left in New Zealand that can force membership onto someone and students have long been fighting to be given the same rights as all New Zealanders.

“The local tennis or rugby club can’t compel membership and instead relies on providing a good quality service that people want in order to attract members – student associations should be no different.

“It is time to end the unfair funding, by all students, of the political activities of radical left wing groups, and put an end to corruption and fraud at these unaccountable and unrepresentative student associations,” said ACT on Campus Vice President Peter McCaffrey.

DECEMBER 1999 - Brenda McQuillan, president of Nelson Polytechnic Student Association, admitted stealing $8004.  
NOVEMBER 2003- Florence Bailey, office manager of Massey Students Association, jailed for two years and three months after stealing $203,000.  
NOVEMBER 2005- Victoria University Maori Student Association treasurer Wi Nepia jailed for stealing $161,000.  
2005 - Otago University's Te Roopu Maori, the Maori students' association, collapsed amid allegations of financial improprieties. Estimated fraud $21,000.  
APRIL 2007 - Clelia Opie, officer of Victoria University Students' Association, spends $6000 on phone calls.  
JUNE 2009 - Helen Lenihan, former officer manager of the Christchurch Polytechnic Students' Association, jailed for 22 months for fraud of $175,000.
