ACT has solutions to student debt

ACT on Campus today applauds the measures to help students and graduates repay their loans, outlined yesterday by ACT Leader Rodney Hide in his State of the Nation speech.

“Mr Hide is spot on with his claim that lowering taxes will help students when they graduate,” Victoria University ACT on Campus President Hannah Collings said today.

“The biggest problem facing tertiary students is undoubtably their student loans when they finish studying.

“ACT’s policy of a lower flatter tax will help students pay off their debt. More money in the back pocket for students and graduates means they can pay off their loans faster.”

Collings, also a member of the Victoria University Student Association executive, took a swipe at the position of the NZUSA co-presidents Camilla Belich and Andrew Kirton. She believes they are out of touch with reality and how to best deal with the problems faced by students.

“The NZUSA leadership has no clue as to how to help students pay off their loans. In fact they have their heads stuck in the sand because they think students shouldn’t have to pay back their debt.

“The ideas put forward by Rodney Hide certainly go a long way to providing a practical, workable solution to mounting student debt.

“Students wouldn’t mind paying their loans if Helen Clark did not take so much in taxes. At least ACT is prepared to help students and workers,” Hannah Collings said.
