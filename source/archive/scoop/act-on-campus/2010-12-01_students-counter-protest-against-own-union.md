Students Counter-Protest Against Own Union

**Students Counter-Protest Against Own Union**

**NZUSA Protests Crashed By Real Students**

"Students across the country have taken to the streets to counter-protest against their own union, in support of Voluntary Student Membership and the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill," says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey.

"The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations held pro-compulsion rallies but, despite having hundreds of thousands of dollars of students' money for advertising, were only able to scrape together a dozen protesters in Wellington and couldn't find ANY Otago students willing to oppose the bill and so didn't even bother to hold a protest down south."

"While the NZUSA protesters were mostly NZUSA officials, former officials, staff and other trade unionists, real students crashed the NZUSA rallies and counter-protested in support of the bill."

"How can students' associations continue to claim that students are opposed to VSM when their own members are protesting against their position?," asks McCaffrey.

"Clearly NZUSA are more interested in ensuring their own pockets remain lined with compulsorily acquired student money than actually advocating for the views of students,"

"The VSM bill will give choice back to students and will ensure that students' associations accurately represent their member's views." says ACT on Campus President, Peter McCaffrey.
