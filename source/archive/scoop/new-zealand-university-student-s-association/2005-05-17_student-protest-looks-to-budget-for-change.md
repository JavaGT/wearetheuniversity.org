Student protest looks to Budget for change

Students and staff will march on Parliament today to demand lower tuition fees and higher staff salaries in the upcoming Budget.

“Since Labour was elected in 1999 student debt has more than doubled going from $3 billion to over $7 billion, tertiary fees are now the highest they have ever been and the number of students getting allowances has decreased. Students will be looking for answers in this Budget,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“Students expected more when the Government was elected and this Budget is the Governments last chance to deliver,” Belich said.

Students and Staff will be presenting the Minister of Education Trevor Mallard with a list of demands when they arrive at Parliament.

“We are demanding immediate fee decreases, increases in staff salaries as well as actual increases in allowances for students,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.

“The fact that staff and students are both taking the message of under-funding of tertiary education to the Government is testament to Labour’s failure,” Kirton said.

The protest will start in the Victoria University Quad at 12 noon with a performance from musician Chris Knox and start at Victoria’s Pipitea Campus at 12.30. Staff and students will then march to Parliament to arrive at 1pm and present Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, with a list of demands.
