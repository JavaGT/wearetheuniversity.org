Students Call for Release of Political Prisoners

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) and the Radical Society (RadSoc) are calling on the New Zealand government to put pressure on the Burmese military regime to release all political prisoners, including student leader Min Ko Naing.

Today marks the 14th anniversary of the massacre of thousands of innocent Burmese, many of them students, who protested against military rule and severe economic mismanagement.

To commemorate this occasion, and to draw attention to the illegal detainment of many innocent citizens, NZUSA and RadSoc have organised a photo exhibition to be held at the Victoria University Students Association, depicting scenes from the massacre.

“Fourteen years ago today, thousands of people sacrificed their lives in Burma to open a new chapter in their country's history. The historic turning point in 1988 led to the birth of a pro-democracy movement that has survived and been sustained over the past fourteen years,” said NZUSA Co-President Charlie Chambers.

“The people of Burma, under the leadership of the National League for Democracy and its leader, Noble Peace Prize Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, want democratic changes through peaceful means. The pro-democracy movement outside Burma supported by the international community, is also waging various campaigns and mobilizing governments to maintain pressure on the military regime while promoting a dialogue process as a way out of the crisis in Burma,” said Chambers.

“The New Zealand Government could take a leading role in supporting the people of Burma. New Zealand has the ability to take an independent foreign policy line and defend global justice and oppressed peoples,” said Chambers.
