Student Debt Summit Predicts Gloomy Future

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) debt summit held in Auckland today outlined a gloomy economic, demographic and social future for New Zealand unless major reform of the student loan scheme occurs.

“The key message from all speakers at the summit was that the current scheme is unfair and that change needs to happen,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

“On the cusp of an election the opportunity is there to make changes to the student loan scheme. If we do not work towards decreasing the cost of tertiary education then it will be all of our futures that will suffer. The answer is to reduce fees and increase access to student allowances,” said Campbell.

“One in ten New Zealanders now has a student loan. This debt summit has provided an opportunity for people from diverse backgrounds to come together and share their views on the problem,” said Campbell.

Speakers at the summit included NZCTU President Ross Wilson, economist Brian Easton and demographer Professor Ian Pool.

“This summit has provided critical input into the debate around the student loan issue. We now have to convert the research, opinion and good ideas generated today into action. The election provides an opportunity to support greater investment in tertiary,” said Campbell.

“Only a significant reinvestment into tertiary education and student support will turn the tide of student debt. We really can’t afford not to,” said Campbell.
