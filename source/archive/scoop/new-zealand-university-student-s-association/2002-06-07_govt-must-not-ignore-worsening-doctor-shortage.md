Govt must not ignore worsening doctor shortage

Govt must not ignore signs of worsening doctor shortage

The Government ignores new signs of a worsening junior doctor shortage at New Zealand's peril, says the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) Co-President Charlie Chambers

\"New research released today by the Medical Students' Association revealing that nearly two thirds of medical students plan on going overseas is frightening proof that workforce problems related to student debt crisis remain unresolved."

"Many regions of New Zealand are crying out for doctors yet our government is driving medical students overseas with a $50 million loan debt hanging around their necks" said Chambers.

"Labour are failing to connect the dots of government policy. High fees plus lack of universal living allowances equals huge student loan debts and workforce shortages in key areas," said Chambers. "This is not a new problem. Medical students have been telling the government this for some time now, but their warnings are falling on deaf ears"

"NZUSA supports the medical students' call for increased access to allowances and for an increase to the trainee intern grant, " said Chambers. "We expect more from this government and we will continue to demand more throughout the election campaign."
