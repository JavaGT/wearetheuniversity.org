80% of New Zealanders Support Universal Student Allowance

80% of New Zealanders support the introduction of a universal student living allowance according to a new Colmar Brunton public opinion survey released today by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“This poll sends the clear message to those political parties that do not support a universal student allowance that they are hugely out of step with public opinion on this issue,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

“Labour signalled in their policy release yesterday that they do not support a universal allowance. In light of public opinion on this matter we suggest they have a rethink within the next four weeks,” said Campbell.

In the current survey there has been a 26.9% increase in the number of people who strongly agree in a universal allowance, now at 53.3%.

“Over half the respondent’s strongly agree in having a universal student allowance. These people recognise that a universal allowance will have the effect of decreasing total student debt, halt the exodus of skilled New Zealanders oversees and address the unfairness of the current system,” said Campbell.

“Universal student allowances are the tertiary education issue of this election. Labour is out of step with their supporters on this issue. We encourage Labour voters to use their party vote for a universal allowance on July 27th,” said Campbell.

NZUSA commissioned the same survey at the end of 2000. At the time 80% of respondents also supported a universal allowance.
