NZSTA announces trustee scholarship winners

Five school trustees will be joining students with heads in their books this year, with the New Zealand Trustee Association’s announcement today that they’ve each won a $4,000 scholarship.

Each year the Crombie Lockwood/Royal & SunAlliance Study Awards are offered to school trustees who are keen to further their studies for personal or professional development within New Zealand or overseas.

The 2003 winners are: Chris Haines, Aparima College, Southland; Jane Thistlethwaite, Homai National School for Blind and Vision Impaired, Hamilton; Hilary Stace, Onslow College, Wellington; Carol Kelly, Newbury School, Palmerston North; Selwyn Bracegirdle, St Patrick’s College, Wellington.

NZSTA President Chris France says school trustees bring a wide variety of skills and expertise from all walks of life, and the association welcomes the chance to recognise their professionalism and offer them an opportunity for further training.

He says the research and study topics chosen by the study award winners will benefit them, their schools and the wider community, and trusteeship generally.

Chris France welcomes the diversity of this year’s topics.

“They are extremely valuable, and include research into school transport; the compilation of a guide for Boards of Trustees on school reunions, archives and trusts; and attending the South Pacific Education of Vision Impaired Conference in Australia.”

The $20,000 scholarship programme was introduced four years ago at NZSTA’s 10th birthday, which celebrated a decade of self-governing schools.

Chris France says NZSTA values the generous support of insurance brokers Crombie Lockwood and insurer, Royal & SunAlliance in sponsoring the award and acknowledging the huge commitment that school trustees make to New Zealand’s education system.
