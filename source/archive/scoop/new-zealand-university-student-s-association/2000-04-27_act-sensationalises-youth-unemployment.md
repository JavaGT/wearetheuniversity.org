ACT SENSATIONALISES YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT

  
The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) has today rejected ACT’s senseless stance on youth employment, which fails to address the real issues concerning youth.

Dr Muriel Newman stated today that long term unemployed youth should be made to search for work 40 hours a week in return for the dole (Evening Post).

“The statistics of youth unemployment is distressing however young people need real jobs and open educational opportunities” says Tanja Schutz, Co President NZUSA, “We need real solutions, not youth to be used as pawns in petty politics”.

“Over the last 9 years under right-wing government policies we have seen youth unemployment, crime and suicide worsen” says Tanja Schutz “National and Act have failed youth and it seems that they will continue to do so, if they cannot come up with constructive policies”.

“Youth unemployment is a result of worsening employment opportunities and increasing barriers to our education system,” says Tanja Schutz. “After nearly a decade of being ignored, we hope that the new Labour- Alliance Government along with the Green party will put more time and energy into listening to the voice of New Zealand’s young people and their concerns for their future”.
