OUTGOING TERTIARY ADVISORY CHAIR WISHED WELL BY STUDENTS

  
The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) are very sad to hear that, Dr Norman Kingsbury, Chair of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) has resigned today.

”Dr Kingsbury has fulfilled his role as chair with integrity and vision,” said Tanja Schutz, Co President NZUSA ”Subsequently he has the respect of the tertiary sector”.

“ Under Dr Kingsbury’s guidance, the commission was established to provide advice to the Government on future directions for the tertiary sector “ said Tanja Schutz “TEAC still has much work to do, but Dr Kingsbury has left it in good stead.”

“TEAC has had the unenviable job of advising the Government on what to do with a sector that was left in a shambles by the previous National government” said Tanja Schutz. “Recent comments made by the opposition tertiary education spokesperson are therefore ironic and somewhat unhelpful.”

NZUSA wish Dr Kingsbury all the best in his future endeavors and look forward to continue working with TEAC in the coming year.
