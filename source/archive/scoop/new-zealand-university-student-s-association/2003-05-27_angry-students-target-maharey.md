Angry students target Maharey

Formerly "student friendly" Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey will be facing angry students again today in Wellington, following protests in Palmerston North, Auckland and Dunedin.

"Steve Maharey is being faced with student fury about fee maxima everywhere he goes," said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) "The proposed fee rises are drawing out placard waving students and scary debt monsters all over the country."

"Labour is making the student debt crisis that faces New Zealand even worse by allowing fees to increase. Fee rises will add to our $5.5 billion dollar debt and lengthen repayment times for graduates," said Fitzsimons.

"The predictability that Labour promised in tertiary fees is horribly familiar," said Fitzsimons. "Labour seem to be delivering an annual fee increase just like the National Party did in the 90s."

"Steve Maharey needs to admit that the government has made a terrible mistake by setting the fee maxima levels so high and excluding postgraduates from fee regulation. It's not too late for him to lower fee maxima and honour his election promise."

Note: Students will be protesting from 3:30 pm in the Hunter Courtyard, Victoria University.
