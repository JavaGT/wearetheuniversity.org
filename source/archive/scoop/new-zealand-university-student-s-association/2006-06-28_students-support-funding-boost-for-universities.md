Students support funding boost for universities

  
The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Dr Michael Cullen, that universities will receive a $26 million funding boost.

“University staff have been fighting for adequate salaries for a long time and it is great the Government has finally recognised this,” said Joey Randall, Co-president of NZUSA.

“The university sector is significantly under-funded by international standards and this funding boost will go some way towards addressing this.”

“University staff are fundamental to a high quality tertiary education, and the most important asset of New Zealand universities.”

“Students have consistently supported staff in their quest for adequate salaries and recognise the hard work of the Combined University Unions.”

“Institutions often use low staff salaries as an excuse to significantly increase student fees. Despite this, student fee increases are rarely used bump up salaries. Now, there will be no excuses for student fee increases for 2007,“ Mr Randall concluded.
