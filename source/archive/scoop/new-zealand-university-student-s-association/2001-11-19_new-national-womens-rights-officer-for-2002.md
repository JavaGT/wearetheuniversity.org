The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) has a new National Women's Rights Officer (NWRO) for 2002.

Anna McMartin from the Otago Polytech Students Association was successfully elected at the NZUSA Special General Meeting over the weekend. The other candidate was Rayna Fahey from the Waikato University Students' Association.

"Both candidates were perfect for the job of NWRO," said Dayna Berghan outgoing NWRO of NZUSA. "I am confident that NZUSA and the National Women's Group are in good hands. I wish Anna the best of luck."
