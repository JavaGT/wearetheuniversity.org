2006 National Student Leaders Elected

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) has elected Conor Roberts, current Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) Administrative Vice-President, and former National Affairs Officer as the second Co-president of NZUSA for 2006.

“I am really excited about representing the interests of students to the Government next year, said Conor Roberts, Co-president elect of NZUSA.

“I am committed to ensuring the introduction of the interest free student loan policy goes smoothly and lobbying to increase access to student allowances,” said Roberts.

Conor will join Joey Randall as NZUSA Co-president in 2006 and Jennifer Jones as NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer who were both elected in October this year.

Joey was previously AUSA Education Vice-President in 2004 and Jennifer is the current Education and Welfare Vice-president at Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA).

“Jenn, Conor and I are really thrilled to be taking on the leadership of NZUSA and we look forward to furthering the goals of students at a national level,” said Joey Randall, NZUSA Co-president elect.

“Well over 50 percent of students are women, however women graduates face longer repayment times than the general population. I look forward to improving the situation for women students in 2006,” said Jennifer Jones, National Women’s Rights Officer elect.

NZUSA is the national body for students and has been representing students since 1929. Current Co-presidents Camilla Belich and Andrew Kirton, and National Women’s Rights Officer Karen Price, will continue in their roles until the end of this year.
