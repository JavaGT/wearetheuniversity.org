Students welcome science students scholarships

Students welcome scholarships for health and animal science students

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) has joined the New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA) in welcoming today’s announcement that the student debt burden will be relieved for some health and animal science students through the introduction of bonded scholarships.

“We’re pleased that the government is taking student debt seriously and seeking to address the workforce shortages that result from student loans,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the NZUSA.

“These scholarships will help lift the barrier of high fees and huge debts for school leavers from low-income families,” said Fitzsimons. “We’ve been working with medical students for many years to fight against their massive fees.”

NZUSA and the New Zealand Nurses Organisation released a survey on the impact of student debt on nurses in June, and is pleased that nursing students are also eligible for the scholarships.

“These scholarships are a start in improving access to tertiary education. The government must look at the entire workforce, including other groups such as teachers and social workers, and make sure that they also receive much needed debt relief.”

“We believe that the problems caused by student debt are so widespread that only a living allowance for all students and fully funded tuition will fix them in the long term.”

“Students are looking forward to the release of the long awaited student support review. All students should receive a living allowance so that they are not reliant on the unfair student loan scheme to cover their living costs.”
