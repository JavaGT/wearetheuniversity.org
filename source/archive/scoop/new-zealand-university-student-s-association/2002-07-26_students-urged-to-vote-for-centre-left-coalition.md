Students Urged to Vote For Centre Left Coalition

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is encouraging tertiary students to vote for a centre left coalition government tomorrow to ensure that universal student allowances and reduced fees are high priorities for the next government.

“We have looked at all the party policies and only Labour’s potential coalition partners are offering both a universal allowance and fee reductions. Labour has indicated in its policy that it is willing to move on allowance eligibility, so it’s not a wasted vote to elect a coalition partner that will push this issue further,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

“In a poll conducted by Colmar Brunton last month 80% of New Zealanders supported a universal living allowance for tertiary students. This will only happen if a centre left coalition government is elected on Saturday,” said Campbell.

“The 90s saw National cut access to allowances and increase fees every year. The past three years have seen a stabilisation of the student loans problem but no solution. Only correcting the drivers of student debt; high fees and lack of living allowances will solve the problem,” said Campbell.

“Students have been campaigning for a universal allowance all year. This election is an opportunity for New Zealanders to attack student debt and elect a government that will introduce a universal allowance,” said Campbell.
