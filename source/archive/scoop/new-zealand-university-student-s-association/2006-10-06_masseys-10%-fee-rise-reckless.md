Massey’s 10% Fee Rise Reckless

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) condemns the move by the Massey University Council to raise all current fees across the board by 5% and to apply to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) for an additional 5% across the board rise.

“This move by the Massey University Council is reckless to say the least. It enables the government to continue underfunding the sector while further indebting students.” said Joey Randall, Co-President of NZUSA.

“Massey students will be facing fee increases of hundreds of dollars next year with research post graduate students facing up to $1500 increases if Massey’s exemption is approved.”

Today’s vote at the Massey University Council meeting passed nine to five.

“The Massey Council have taken the easy way out by forcing Government under funding onto students instead of attacking the problem at its root cause,” said Randall. “It’s no wonder that the OECD recently highlighted New Zealand’s high fee levels and relatively low Government investment.”

“We hope the Tertiary Education Commission has more sense than the majority of the current Massey Council and rejects Massey’s claim for a further 5% fee increase,” concluded Randall.
