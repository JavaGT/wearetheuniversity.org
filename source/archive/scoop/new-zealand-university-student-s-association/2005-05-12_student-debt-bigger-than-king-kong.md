Student debt: Bigger than King Kong

Students’ associations from around the country are launching their student debt campaign in the lead up to the General Election. With total student debt now over $ 7 billion dollars students feel they have a right to claim that student debt is much bigger than King Kong.

“This year our number one priority is decreases in student fees. The Government has allowed fees to rise over the last couple of years to alarmingly high levels, ” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“Every student knows fees are completely unaffordable and fees account for approximately 60% of total student debt,” said Kirton.

“Political parties should not discount the student vote. Students will be thinking of their student debt come election day and will be voting accordingly,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of NZUSA.

“We also hope to see policy from political parties that lead to dramatic increases in student allowances,” said Belich.
