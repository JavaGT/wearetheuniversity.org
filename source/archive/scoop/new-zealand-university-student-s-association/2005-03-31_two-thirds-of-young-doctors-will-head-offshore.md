New figures show two thirds of young doctors will head offshore

New research released today by the New Zealand Medical Association (NZMA), the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) and the New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA), Doctors and Debt: The Effect of Student Debt on Doctors, shows that after graduation average doctors’ student debt was $65,206 and that two thirds of young doctors considered that they would head offshore within three years.

The research also found that 48 percent of respondents considered moving overseas as a result of their student debt.

“These figures show that the huge student debt that medical students are forced into is pushing our desperately needed young doctors overseas in droves,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“New Zealand medical students pay some of the highest fees in the world and as a result 75% of doctors owed over $50,000 at graduation, while 13% of respondents owed over $100,000 in student debt,” Belich said.

The research also demonstrated the various negative impacts of debt on of doctors’ lives.

“Eighty eight percent of respondents reported increased levels of stress because of their student debt and 42% said their debt would influence when and if they had children,” said Jesse Gale, President of New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA).

“We call on Trevor Mallard to immediately increase the trainee intern grant, reduce medical school fees that are currently $11,000 per year and provide all students with a living allowance. Otherwise these massive debts will continue to drive young doctors overseas, and away from General Practice and rural areas,” said Gale.
