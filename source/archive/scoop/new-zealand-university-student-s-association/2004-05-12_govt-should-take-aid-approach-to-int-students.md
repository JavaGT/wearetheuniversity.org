Government should take aid not trade approach to international students

Students are calling on the government to take an aid not trade approach to international students in light of the announcement that the government is spending $40 million on initiatives designed to lift New Zealand’s overseas profile including scholarships for international students.

“The government and tertiary institutions must stop treating international students as cash cows to prop up the New Zealand economy,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association. “The government must take responsibility for funding tertiary education instead of relying on international students paying huge fees.”

The government has today announced the introduction of 33 scholarships for international students.

“The government should take its international aid obligations seriously by ensuring that these scholarships are available for students who would not otherwise have the chance to participate in tertiary education,” said Fitzsimons.

“The education of international students is not an industry like wool or wine, government investment would be better placed in ensuring that international students have access to high quality support services when studying in New Zealand and that all tertiary education institutions are properly funded.”
