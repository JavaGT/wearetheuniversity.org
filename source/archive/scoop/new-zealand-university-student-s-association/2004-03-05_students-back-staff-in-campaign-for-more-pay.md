Students back staff in campaign for more pay

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is backing the Association of University Staff campaign for more pay.

“Quality academic and general staff are what holds New Zealand’s universities together,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA. “It’s time that university management and government recognised this and came up with the funds necessary to recruit and retain university staff.”

Fitzsimons said that students appreciated the hard work of university staff and supports their pay keeping up with comparable professionals in New Zealand and internationally.

“University staff have been put off too long now by VCs who are more eager to spend up on advertising campaigns or give themselves big pay rises,” said Fitzsimons. “If the universities and the government don’t act now, they will be responsible for greater industrial action, unhappy staff and unhappy students.”

“Students and staff will continue to work together to fight for better wages and conditions for staff, and for better student support in the form of a living allowance for all students,” said Fitzsimons.
