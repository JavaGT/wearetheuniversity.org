Education marketing spend rises by two thirds

Tertiary spending on advertising through AC Nielsen has increased by nearly two thirds since 1999, according to figures released today by the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA).

\"Public universities, polytechnics and colleges of education spent nearly $75 million competing with each other in advertising over the last four years," said NZUSA Co-President Roz Connelly. "This represents a massive waste in public money and in student fees."

The increase in spending took place during a period that government hailed as the end of competition in public tertiary education.

"The amount wasted by public tertiary institutions rose significantly each year of the Labour government," said NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons. "Spending on TV, radio, print and cinema advertising went from just under $13 million in 1999 to over $23 million in 2002."

"The AC Nielsen figures are only the tip of the iceberg," said Fitzsimons. "When you add in staff at institutions, direct mail, and the plethora of promotions and competitions run by institutions, the marketing bill will be well in excess of $100 million."

"We call on the Government and the newly formed Tertiary Education Commission to start reining in this ridiculous spending spree," said Fitzsimons. "If they don't, this spending will continue to rise each year - and it's students and taxpayers who are paying the price."
