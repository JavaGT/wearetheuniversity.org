Knowledge Society Requires Wave Of Reinvestment

Knowledge Society Requires Wave Of Reinvestment In Tertiary Education

“If New Zealand is going to have a knowledge society there needs to be major reinvestment to improve quality and access to tertiary education,” said Andrew Campbell, Co-President of the New Zealand University Student’s Association (NZUSA).

Campbell, who is one of the few student leaders attending the Catching the Knowledge Wave Conference says the investment will have to be more that what the government is offering in its current fee freeze deal.

“We support the government’s attempts to freeze fees. But we all need to realise that if tertiary education is to meet the needs of a new knowledge society, that there needs to be open access and increased quality,” said Campbell.

“Many of the economies that New Zealand wants to emulate have free education – including Ireland and half of the EU,” said Andrew Campbell. “There’s never been a better time for the government to put together a plan for free education and for greater research and learning in public tertiary education.”

“The Prime Minister has said that this conference has to find solutions outside government and that’s true. But the government also needs to play their part and fund tertiary education to be the engine room of the knowledge society.”

“The government has freed up funds through its PTE moratorium,” said Andrew Campbell. “The time is right for reinvestment in tertiary education.”
