Students welcome polytechnics working together to offer course information

The launch of a new website for prospective students seeking information about studying at polytechnics in the Wellington region was today welcomed by the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA).

"Public tertiary education institutions waste thousands of dollars in student fees on unnecessary marketing and promotion," said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA..

"This website initiative shows how institutions can work together in the best interests of students instead of competing with each other and raising student fees to fund their marketeering."

"The website will be far more useful than a free drink bottle or hacky sack as has become the marketing norm at other tertiary institutions," said Fitzsimons "Students have borne the brunt of tertiary institutions increasing marketing expenditure over the last four years. Both Victoria and Massey Universities have simultaneously raised tuition fees and kicked off new television advertising campaigns."

"We challenge all public tertiary institutions to cut marketing expenditure and reduce student fees accordingly," said Fitzsimons.

"If all public tertiary institutions co-operated nationally on course advice and recruitment it would be a win-win situation. Student fees would reduce and students would be able to make balanced, informed decisions about what and where to study," said Fitzsimons.
