Fee security for Waikato International Students
===============================================

Finally, fee security for International Students at Waikato University

The Waikato University Council voted today to re-introduce grand-parenting for international student fees. Grand-parenting means that international students can be assured that the level of fees charged for the duration of their study will not increase.

“International students at Waikato University have worked long and hard for fee grand-parenting. They will be delighted with this major win,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“In the past, many international students have lived in impoverished conditions or have had to stop studying because of huge increases in their student fees,” Belich said.

“We are disappointed that the introduction of fee grand-parenting was coupled with a sharp 7.41% fee increase for international students but grand-parenting will goes a long way towards treating international students as human beings and not cash cows for their institutions,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.

“We encourage all tertiary institutions to follow the lead of Massey University, AUT and now Waikato University and immediately introduce fee certainty for international students,” said Kirton.
