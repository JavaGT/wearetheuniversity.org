Students back Southland in NPC – the zero fees team

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is backing Southland in this year’s NPC competition.

“The Southland team are taking a great free education message to the country with ‘zero fees’ emblazoned across their shirts,” said NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons. “Wherever they play, students will welcome the message that zero fees are great for our communities, for our economy and of course for students.”

“No matter how Southland fare in the NPC, the Southland region is a winner because of the benefits free education at the Southern Insitute of Technology have brought to the region,” said Fitzsimons. “Students have flocked to Invercargill and revitalised the region.”

“We can all learn from what has happened in Southland. We want free education to make its way up the country and be available to all students. The Soutland rugby team will be taking the zero fees story to rugby fans everywhere.”
