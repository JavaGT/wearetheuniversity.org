40% of queer students said that they had experienced harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity whilst at university, according to a survey released today by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

The survey of sixty queer students found that the most common types of harrassment were verbal harrassment and threats of violence.

“This survey provides a valuable basis for immediate action and future research for Queer and Transgender students on campus.” said Dayna Berghan, NZUSA UniQ co-ordinator and National Women’s Rights Officer.

Students from six campuses were surveyed. The research was to ascertain the incidence of sexual orientation and gender identity harassment on all university campuses and to assess the needs of bisexual, gay, intersex, lesbian, takatapui and transgender students.

A copy of the survey is available for any group or individual. Please contact NZUSA for further details.
