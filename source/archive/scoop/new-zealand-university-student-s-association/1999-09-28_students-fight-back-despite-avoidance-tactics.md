Students Fight Back Despite Avoidance Tactics
=============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand University Student's Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association)**

\"University students are taking action around the country against increasing tertiary fees despite most University councils attempting to set fees during exam periods or holidays" said Karen Skinner Co-President of the New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA). "These dirty tactics are being employed by most Universities, but students will not be silenced"

Students at Massey University Palmerston North have occupied the entrance to their University today. "NZUSA fully supports students taking action against government under funding and University fee increases" said Ms Skinner.

"It is students who are suffering the consequences of these fee hikes and we are going to make the University, government and the public aware of what they are doing. We want to force the government and the University councils face up to the full impact of their decisions. We can only really show them that through direct action."

Today’s action follows a 51 hour occupation of registry at Canterbury University and a student occupation of the Ministry of Education building in Dunedin. Next week Victoria students will be marching to Parliament.

"This is meant to be a public education system, but increasing user-pays is taking the chance of University education away form many. Students around the country are defending their rights and the rights of generations to come, to a tertiary education. We demand that Universities back such action before we have nothing left of public education to defend" concluded Ms Skinner.
