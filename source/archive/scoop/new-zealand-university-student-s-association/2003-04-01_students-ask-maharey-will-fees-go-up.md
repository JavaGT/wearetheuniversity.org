Students ask Maharey: Will fees go up?

Students are calling on Tertiary Minister Steve Maharey to publicly respond to the report on fees maxima that he released sixty days ago with a commitment that student fees will not increase.

"Maharey has had the report for well over two months: students are looking for a commitment from him that the upcoming budget will bring fee decreases," said New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons.

"Throughout the 1990s when institutions had fee setting power fees spiralled out of control. Students were pleased when the government announced that they would step in and control the setting of tuition fees by setting a maximum tertiary institutions could charge," said Fitzsimons. "However this intervention by government will only be successful if it leads to fee decreases."

"The government must make a commitment to students by setting the fee maxima levels as low as possible to ensure that they do not act as a disincentive to participation in tertiary education," said NZUSA Co-President Roz Connelly.

"Fees are one of the key drivers of the huge student debt that is having such a destructive affect on New Zealand society. Our best and brightest are going overseas to rid themselves of debt. The government needs to realise this and reduce fees progressively over the next three years," said Connelly

NZUSA is also seeking commitments before the budget from United Future, the Greens and the Progressive Coalition that they will support moves to ensure that no students face fee increases.
