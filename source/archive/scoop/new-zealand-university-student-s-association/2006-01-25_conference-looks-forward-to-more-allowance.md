Student conference looks forward to more student allowances

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is holding its annual January Conference in Wellington over the next three days. The focus of the Conference will be strategic planning for the next three years in the lead up to the 2008 General Election.

“Polytechnic, college of education and university student representatives from all over New Zealand will meet this week to discuss the pressing issues facing students and how we can go about achieving positive change,” said Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“Currently, less than one third of students are receiving student allowances. After the tremendous achievement of interest free student loans the student movement will be looking to increase support to students while they study,” said Randall. Also on the conference agenda is strategic planning for NZUSA as an organisation and an address by Hon. Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Tertiary Education.

“Students will want the Minister to commit to increasing student support and immediately lowering fees if he is serious about the student debt crisis,” said Nick Kelly, President of the Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA). The annual NZUSA January Conference will be hosted by Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA) and the Independent Students’ Association of Whiterea (ISAW).

The conference will be addressed by the Hon. Dr Michael Cullen at 1pm in the Memorial Lecture Theatre, Student Union Building, Victoria University, Kelburn, Wellington, media are welcome to attend. For further information or a copy of the agenda, contact:
