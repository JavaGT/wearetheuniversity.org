Women Students Support Prostitution Reform

Women students are expressing their support for the Prostitution Reform Bill, which is due for its third reading this week.

\"In our current user pays environment, some women students have turned to sex work to support themselves," said Camilla Belich, National Women's Rights Officer. "We support moves to protect those women and all sex workers from exploitation and to uphold their rights - both as humans and as workers."

Women student representatives feel that if any of their members work in the sex industry, they are entitled to work in a safe environment and be protected from harm.

"The current legislation that allows for prosecution of prostitutes and not clients is prejudiced and sexist. There should be no room for prejudicial and sexist legislation in New Zealand."

Belich said many student representatives had come to her with feelings of strong support for the bill, through the Tertiary Women's Focus Group (TWFG). "We believe that the health and wellbeing of all women is important and urge members of parliament to vote in support of the Prostitution Reform Bill," said Belich

The Tertiary Women's Focus Group joins the long list of diverse women's organisations supporting the Prostitution Reform Bill. These include, YWCA, National Council of Women, Women's Electoral Lobby, Family Planning Association, Maori Women's Welfare League, the Catholic Women's League, the Business and Professional Women's Association and the National Collective of Independent Women's Refuges.
