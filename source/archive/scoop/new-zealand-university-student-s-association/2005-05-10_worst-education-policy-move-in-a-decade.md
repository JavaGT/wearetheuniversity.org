Tertiary Savings Scheme: worst education policy move in a decade

Students are calling the Government’s request for expressions of interest in a tertiary savings scheme the worst tertiary policy move by any government in over a decade.

“A savings scheme for tertiary education will mean families will have to save for two decades just so their son or daughter can have a chance in tertiary education. We need solutions to the student debt crisis now, not in 20 years time,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“The Government have admitted that tertiary education is too expensive. If they want to address this, then they must tackle the drivers of debt; high fees and lack of access to allowances,” Belich added.

“Regardless of their public spin, Labour no longer stands for affordable tertiary education. Fees are higher than ever, the number of people accessing allowances has decreased and total student debt has more than doubled since 1999,” said Andrew Kirton Co-President of NZUSA.

"This is a Government that gives with one hand and takes with the other. Voters need to know that Labour wants you to pay more for your education,” said Kirton.

Students are promising continuing action around the country in opposition to this unpopular move.
