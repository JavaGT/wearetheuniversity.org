Students to hold national day of protest action for living allowances tomorrow

Students around the country will tomorrow hold a national day of protest action calling on the government to introduce a living allowance for all students.

“We have written and met with MPs, presented them with a petition from over 35,000 people and still Helen Clark refuses to accept that a living allowance for all students is the best way to address the $7 billion student debt monster” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association.

“Students are frustrated that the government will not address the major public policy anomaly that sees students as the only group in society that are forced to borrow to live,” said Fitzsimons “We are hopeful that the Government will take this day of protest action seriously and introduce a living allowance for all students.”

What is happening around the country?

Hamilton: Protest march from the University and the Polytechnic to Garden Place where student and community leaders will address the rally  
Wellington: Rally at Victoria University then protest march to Local MP Marian Hobb’s electorate office  
Auckland: Protest outside Helen Clark’s electorate office  
Dunedin: Rally at the University Union Lawn and then protest March  
Palmerston North: Rally on Concourse at Massey University
