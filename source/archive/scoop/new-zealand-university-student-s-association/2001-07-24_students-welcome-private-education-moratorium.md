Students welcome private education moratorium
=============================================

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is today welcoming the government’s decision to cut public funding to new private training courses and providers.

“Students have been calling on the government to stop funding private education on the same basis as public for the past three years. It is good to see the government has responded to the pleas of the public education sector,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

“It simply doesn’t make sense for the government to fund private education providers in the same way as its own state providers. The government doesn’t do this for private secondary schools or private hospitals. It is positive that there are now substantive moves to correct this anomaly,” said Campbell.

“The next step should be for the government to transfer funds it would have spent funding new private courses to improving quality and access to the public system,” said Campbell.

“At long last the government is recognising that there is a difference between public and private education and that they have a greater responsibility to their own universities, polytechnics, colleges of education and wananga,” said Campbell.
