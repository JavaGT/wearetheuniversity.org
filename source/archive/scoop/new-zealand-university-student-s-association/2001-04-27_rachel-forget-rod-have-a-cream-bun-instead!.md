Rachel, Forget Rod, have a cream bun instead!

Forget Rod, forget Kevin, Rachel-  
have a cream bun instead! .

Women from the Tertiary Women's Focus Group, (the women's network of the New Zealand University Students Association) are pleading with supermodel and actor Rachel Hunter not to lose any more weight to please modelling agencies.

The plea is sparked by recent media attention on Hunter's dramatic weight loss. New Idea reported that in the last two months Hunter had shed 15 kilos and had gone from a "healthy" size 12 to a "fragile" size eight.

"This recent media attention on Hunter's weight couldn't come at a more fitting moment," said Dayna Berghan, the National Women's Rights Officer for NZUSA. "No Diet Day is next week on May 6".

According to the Wellington Eating Disorder Services (WEDS) 1994 high school survey, by the age of 15, 54% of 4th form girls in New Zealand have dieted, 38% reported bingeing and 12% have vomited to lose weight. WEDS also found that while 80% of women were within 'normal' weight limits, only 18% thought they were 'normal' weight.

"Young women are influenced by what they see in the media. We don't want to see more young women starving themselves to fit an ideal where even Rachel Hunter is considered too fat" said Dayna Berghan.

"The goals of No Diet Day are to accept your body in whatever shape or size that it may be and accept that you do not need to diet to achieve 'perfection" continued Berghan. "My advice to Hunter is to stop dieting to achieve Hollywood perfection. Instead have a cream bun, love your body and relax."
