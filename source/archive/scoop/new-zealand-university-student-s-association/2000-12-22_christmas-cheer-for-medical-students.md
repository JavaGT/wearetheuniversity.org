Christmas Cheer For Medical Students
====================================

**Friday, 22 December 2000, 4:19 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand University Student's Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association)**

The New Zealand University Students Association welcomes the Government’s announcement today that medical students in 2001 will be entitled to student allowances for the full seven years of study, rather than limited to 5 years.

“This policy change has been a long time coming and is a step in the right direction” said Tanja Schutz, Co President NZUSA. “Medical students entitled to access student allowances will now be able to fully concentrate on their studies, rather than juggling heavy part time work commitments and high pressure study commitments.”

“NZUSA is still concerned about the disparity between those students who are not eligible for allowances due to means testing of parental income“, said Tanja Schutz, “means testing denies students independence and expects families on moderate incomes to finance their children up to the age of 25”.

“This policy change rounds off a positive year of change for tertiary students under the Labour Alliance Government”, said Tanja Schutz.
