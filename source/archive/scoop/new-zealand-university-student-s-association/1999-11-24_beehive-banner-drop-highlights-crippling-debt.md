Beehive Banner Drop Highlights Crippling Debt
=============================================

At 7am today three Victoria University students climbed up the side of the beehive in Wellington and hung a banner which read 'Student debt - National Shame'

"This action was designed to highlight the far reaching effect of the massive student loan debt. There are many undecided voters and we need to take strong action to show the urgent need to vote out National" said VUWSA campaigns officer Yadana Saw, one of the climbers.

"National's underfunding of education has created a student debt monster. Their failure to take action has meant that the situation has got progressively worse. Education is now in crisis.

"Open access to education is crucial to democracy, and it is a right that many people are being denied because of their financial situation.

"We want to highlight the devastating effects of National's policies to ensure that students and the general public vote them out in the election!" concluded Ms Saw
