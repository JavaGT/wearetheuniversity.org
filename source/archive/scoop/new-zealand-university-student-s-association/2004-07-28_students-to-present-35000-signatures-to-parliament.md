Students to present 35,000 strong petition for living allowances to Select Committee with real life examples

Students with over $30,000 of student loan debt each will join student leaders today in presenting a petition to the Education and Science Select Committee from over 35,000 New Zealanders calling on the government to introduce a living allowance for all students.

“I have a $30,000 student debt as I am unable to get a student living allowance to pay for my basic costs of living like rent, food and power,” said Victoria University student Susan King who will address the Select Committee. “It is not fair that my generation are forced to borrow from the harsh student loan scheme to pay our basic costs of living.”

“This petition sends a very clear message to all political parties in the lead up to the 2005 election: a living allowance for all students is the next step in dealing with the student debt crisis,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA.

“Politicians need to consider the thousands of young New Zealanders who will be voting for the first time at the 2005 election, many of whom have signed this petition and are terrified at the thought of a massive student loan debt hanging over their heads,” said Massey University student Kate Catalinac who will address the Select Committee about her $35,000 student loan debt.

The petition will be presented by students Susan King and Kate Catalinac who are not entitled to a student living allowance along with the NZUSA Co-Presidents: Fleur Fitzsimons and Andrew Kirton today at 11:30am in Room G10 at Parliament Buildings.
