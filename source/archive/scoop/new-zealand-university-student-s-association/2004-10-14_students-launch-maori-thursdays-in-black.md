Students launch Maori ‘Thursdays In Black’ campaign against rape and violence

Te Mana Akonga (National Maori Tertiary Students’ Association) and The Tertiary Women’s Focus Group (TWFG) of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) will today launch a te reo Maori ‘Thursdays in Black’ shirt to add to the ‘Thursdays in Black’ campaign that demands a world without rape and violence.

“The aim of this campaign is to halt all forms of violence towards Maori, including the violence of racism,” said Dr. Helen Potter, Kaituhono of Te Mana Akonga. “In particular, the campaign focuses on eradicating domestic violence against Maori women and shows that Maori women will fight against violence on all fronts”.

“The ‘Thursdays In Black’ shirts show that the wearer is no longer willing to put up with rape and violence in their community. It shows a desire for a community where there is no discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, political affiliation, gender or ethnicity,” said Camilla Belich, National Women’s Rights Officer of NZUSA.

‘Thursdays in Black’ is an international campaign that was started by groups like the Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina, Black Sash in South Africa and the Women in Black movements in the former Yugoslavia.

The launch of the new Maori shirts will take place at the NZUSA and TMA Offices. A representative from Te Whare Rokiroki Maori Women’s Refuge will also address the gathering.

Thursdays in Black Maori Launch- today, 5:30pm, level 3, Mason King Building, 354 Lambton Quay, Wellington.
