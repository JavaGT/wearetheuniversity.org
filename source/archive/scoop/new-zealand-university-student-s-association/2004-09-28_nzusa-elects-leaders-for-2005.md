NZUSA elects leaders for 2005

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) elected its officers for 2005 at its annual September conference in Dunedin over the weekend. Camilla Belich and Andrew Kirton will be the Co-Presidents of NZUSA for 2005 and Karen Price will be the NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer.

“I am really excited about the potential to achieve positive change for students both in the lead up to and after the general election,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President elect of NZUSA.

Camilla Belich is currently the National Women’s Rights Officer of NZUSA and a Law student at Victoria University.

“As long as students are forced to borrow to live and fees are going up, we have plenty of work to do. Next year we will be campaigning aggressively for lower fees and a living allowance for all students,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.

Andrew Kirton was re-elected as Co-President and was previously the President of the Lincoln University Students’ Association.

“Government must face up to the fact that women take on average twice as long as men to repay their student loans and commit to reducing student debt instead of letting it grow out of control,” said Karen Price, NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer elect.

Karen Price was previously on the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association executive.
