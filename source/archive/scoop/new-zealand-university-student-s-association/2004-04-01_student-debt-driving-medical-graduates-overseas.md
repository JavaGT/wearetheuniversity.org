Student debt driving medical graduates overseas

New figures show student debt driving more medical graduates overseas

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is calling on the government to respond to figures released by the New Zealand Medical Council today that show more medical graduates going overseas by introducing a living allowance for all students.

\"The government cannot ignore the fact that high student debt is driving even more medical students overseas" said Fleur Fitzsimons Co-President of NZUSA. "The government must prevent a major public health crisis by introducing a living allowance for all students to curb student debt and keep medical graduates in New Zealand."

The figures show that more doctors are going overseas earlier in the careers, staying longer or not returning at all.

"Doctors have always travelled overseas, but huge student debts are forcing them to leave early and in many cases not return," said Fitzsimons.

"This government should show its commitment to the health of New Zealanders by making sure that our medical workforce is encouraged to stay in New Zealand and work for New Zealanders," said Fitzsimons.

"This is not a new problem, students and professional groups have been raising this issue with the government for years, it is about time Labour delivered for students and saved the New Zealand health system from absolute ruin."
