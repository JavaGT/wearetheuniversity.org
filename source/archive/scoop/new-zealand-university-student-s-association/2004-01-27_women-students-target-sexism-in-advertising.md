Women Students Target Sexism in Advertising

A national gathering of women students meeting in Wellington over the next two days is set to target sexism in advertising and other issues concerning women in tertiary education.

The opening conference of the Tertiary Women's Focus Group is meeting at Victoria University on 27 and 28 January. They will be addressed by various speakers including Associate Minister of Maori Affairs Tariana Turia.

\"Women students are determined to make our presence felt on a variety of issues," said Camilla Belich, National Women's Rights Officer at NZUSA. "We'll be on the streets of Wellington late this afternoon to protest a recent resurgence of sexist advertising."

"Women students are the target market of lots of companies who are using sexism to try and sell their products," said Belich. "Today we will be sending those companies a message that sexist advertising is not acceptable."
