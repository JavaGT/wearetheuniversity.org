Students Back Alliance Over EUB

Students Back Alliance Over EUB  
Labour Urged To Respond

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is today backing the call for the reinstatement of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) for students over summer by the Alliance.

Prior to 1998 all students over 18 were eligible for the EUB if they were unable to find work. National’s cuts to the EUB made two thirds of students ineligible for any government support over the summer months.

Alliance Education spokesperson Liz Gordon announced today at the NZUSA Conference that it is the Alliance’s intention to ensure that the government reinstates the benefit this year.

Dr Gordon also told NZUSA that universal student allowances, freezing student loan interest rates and initiatives to encourage professional graduates to stay in New Zealand would be the Alliance’s top tertiary education priorities for this term of government.

“We’re happy to see the Alliance taking a staunch position on tertiary education issues. NZUSA believes that the reinstatement of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit must be in the government budget this year”, said Andrew Campbell, NZUSA Co President.

“When National cut the EUB, Steve Maharey called it a “mean spirited attack” on students. With Labour’s coalition partner now publicly calling for the EUB’s reinstatement, Mr Maharey has the opportunity to back those words up and save students from another summer with no income”, said Campbell.

“We urge Labour to take up this challenge that the Alliance and students have given them and restore the EUB immediately”.
