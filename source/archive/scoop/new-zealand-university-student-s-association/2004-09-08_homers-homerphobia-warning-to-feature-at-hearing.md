Students to present MPs at Civil Union Bill hearing with Homer Simpson’s warning against ‘homerphobia’

Student representatives from the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) will today present their submission in favour of the Civil Union Bill and give MPs a poster asking them to consider who homophobia has prevented them from knowing.

“The Civil Union bill is a step forward for New Zealand in recognising the rights of same sex couples and signalling that homophobia will not be tolerated,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA.

In a survey completed by NZUSA, 40 percent of queer students said that they had experienced harassment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity whilst participating in tertiary study.

“The harassment experienced by queer students causes much suffering and undermines their ability to take part in education,” said Fitzsimons.

“We will be presenting MPs at the select committee with a poster of Homer Simpson asking them who homophobia has prevented them from knowing,” said Fitzsimons.

“MPs who voted against the Civil Union Bill are voting against basic human rights for same sex couples and for more homophobia and intolerance in our society.”

Students are speaking to the Select Committee at 9:45am at Parliament.
