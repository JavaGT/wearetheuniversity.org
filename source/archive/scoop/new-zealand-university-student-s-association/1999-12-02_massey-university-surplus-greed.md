Massey University – Surplus Greed
=================================

**Thursday, 2 December 1999, 12:38 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand University Student's Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association)**

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is disgusted that Massey University is proposing a 10-16% tuition fee increase, when the institution is expecting a 5 million dollar surplus without any fee increases. The fee setting process will be held on Friday at 10am and proposes an increase to achieve a surplus of 12-16 million dollars.

“ University Councils have a legal obligation to encourage the greatest possible participation by the communities they serve, and to pay particular attention to the interests of the underrepresented” said Ms Schutz, Co President NZUSA, “These fee increases are absolutely unjustifiable”.

“One wonders what Massey University needs all this money for – perhaps another extravagant advertising spending spree, which doesn’t manage to bring any new students in”

“The fact that students are mortgaging their lives for the sake of an education and future job opportunities does not seem to register with this institution” says Ms Schutz “ Instead students are looked upon as cash cows to be milked at any opportunity to the tune of multi -million dollar surpluses”.

“This country is already contending with a growing 3 billion dollar student loan debt, as well as access restrictions to allowances and community wage – student.” Said Ms Schutz “ This tuition fee proposal is nothing short of an outrage and shame ”.

NZUSA call on Massey University Council to reassess their tuition fee increase in light of major financial strain this will cause current and future students and the election of a Labour – Alliance Government.
