Government needs to address the real cause of doctor shortages

“The Government workforce health task force group report needs to address the real issue of doctor shortages in New Zealand” stated Josh Clark Co-President of the New Zealand (NZUSA).

“Medical Students in New Zealand pay some of the highest tuition fees in the world for their education and consequently medical graduates leave with some of the largest debts.”

The NZUSA Doctors and Debt case book (2005) found that nearly 65% of recent medical graduates intended to leave our shores within three years of graduation.

“Many graduate doctors felt that the need to repay high student loan debts and competitive working conditions overseas meant that staying in New Zealand was not an attractive option”

“If the government is serious about addressing the current crisis of doctor retention it needs to deal with the issue of high tuition fees and lack of student support while studying” concluded Josh Clark Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students Association (NZUSA)
