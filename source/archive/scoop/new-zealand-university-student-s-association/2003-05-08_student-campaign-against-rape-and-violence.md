Student campaign against rape and violence
==========================================

Student campaign against rape and violence re-launched

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is re-launching its national campaign against rape and violence 'Thursdays in Black' on Thursday 8 May. This includes a national action of a minute of silence to remember the survivors of rape and violence throughout history. This will take place at 3pm this Thursday.

"Wearing black on Thursdays is one way women students are protesting against war," said Camilla Belich, NZUSA National Women's Rights Officer.

'Thursdays in Black' invites all people in New Zealand to wear black on Thursdays indicating their demand for a world without rape, violence and discrimination. The campaign is based on opposition to all violence - whether it is unjust wars or domestic violence.

"The campaign focuses on ways that the individual can challenge attitudes to rape and violence. It challenges the existing social taboos associated particularly with rape and domestic violence," said Belich.

'Thursdays in Black' was started by groups like Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina, Black Sash in South Africa and the Women in Black movements in Israel-Palestine and the former Yugoslavia. The World Council of Churches has also been involved in facilitating the campaign internationally.

The New Zealand University Students' Association and the Tertiary Women's Focus Group are proud to run this campaign in New Zealand. "Wearing black on a Thursday is a gesture of solidarity for all women, men and children who are outraged by the incidences of rape and violence that happen in our communities."

Campus women's groups from NZUSA constituent associations will be organising actions to publicise the campaign.
