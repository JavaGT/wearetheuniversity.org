Less Student Debt Equals More Teachers

Less student debt equals more teachers

Trevor Mallard's claims that he is on top of the shortage in secondary teachers are unconvincing, say the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA).

"While some teaching students have been lucky enough to get scholarships, many others are facing ten per cent fee rises this year due to a loophole in the new fee maxima," said Fleur Fitzsimons, NZUSA Co-President.

"It doesn't wash for government to act concerned about a lack of teachers and allow National Party-size fee increases at Wellington and Dunedin Colleges of Education," said Fitzsimons.

All four colleges of education raised their fees under the governments new fee maxima policy.

"The governments fee maxima policy has failed teaching students and lead to more student debt and even longer loan repayment times for these students."

"It is clear that student debt is wreaking havoc with the New Zealand workforce, if this government was serious about fixing the teaching shortage, they would lower fees and introduce a living allowance for all students" said Fitzsimons.
