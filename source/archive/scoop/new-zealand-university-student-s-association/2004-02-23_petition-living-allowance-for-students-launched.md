Petition for a living allowance for all students launched

Students launched a petition today calling on the government to introduce a living allowance for all students to curb student debt.

\"We're calling on the government to introduce a living allowance for all students regardless of their age or their parents' income." said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students' Association "It's time Labour showed that it supports students and is genuinely committed to dealing with the ever-growing student debt mountain."

"Labour have said that they will increase access to student allowances in the upcoming budget. We're making it clear through this petition that a living allowance for all students is our bottom line."

"Only one third of students are currently entitled to access to allowances with the rest being forced to borrow from the student loan scheme to pay for basics like food and housing."

"Labour have been talking about living allowances since they were first elected in 1999. Now is the time to put their money where their mouth is and produce a decent solution to the debt crisis: a living allowance for all."

Students will be presenting the petition to the government in mid-April.
