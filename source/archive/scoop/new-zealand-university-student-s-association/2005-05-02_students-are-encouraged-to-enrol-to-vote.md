Students are encouraged to enrol to vote this Election

Students’ associations are encouraging students to enrol to vote this year in the General Election.

“There is a common perception that students and young people don’t vote. Students’ associations around New Zealand are committed to reversing this trend and ensuring students do vote,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“This Election we are promising a large student turnout, hopefully the biggest ever,” said Belich.

“Political parties should not discount the student vote when setting policy in the lead up to the Election, or the fact that students will vote based on policy that affects them,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.

“We have been working with the Electoral Commission to ensure that information on enrolling and voting is as accessible as possible for all students,” said Kirton.

Enrolment update packs will be sent out from now until June 2005 to all eligible voters who are currently enrolled. Students who don’t receive an update pack or think that they might not be enrolled are encouraged to contact their local Registrar of Electors or phone 0800 36 76 56.
