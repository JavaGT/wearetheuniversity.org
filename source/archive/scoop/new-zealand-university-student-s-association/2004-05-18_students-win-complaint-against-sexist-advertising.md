Students win complaint against sexist advertising

A campaign against sexist advertising led by students has ended in a complaint being upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority about a sexist promotion at Dunedin pub the Bowler.

“Our Advertising Standards complaint against the “Wife Beater Wednesdays” has been upheld,” said Camilla Belich, National Women’s Rights Officer. “This means the pub will be asked to abandon this offensive advertising.”

“This win is a real credit to the Dunedin students who have stood up against domestic violence and its devastating impact on women.”

“Feminism is alive and well on tertiary campuses and it’s great to have success like this,” said Belich. “We are encouraged by this result and will continue to fight against the sexism and discrimination that women face in New Zealand.”

Belich said that she hopes other businesses will learn from the misguided and sexist promotion. “Sexism doesn’t sell and using images of domestic violence will meet strong opposition from students and the whole community. “
