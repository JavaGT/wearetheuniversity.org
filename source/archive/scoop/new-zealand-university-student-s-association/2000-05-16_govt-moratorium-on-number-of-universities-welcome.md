Govt. Moratorium On Number Of Universities Welcome

Govt. Moratorium On Number Of Universities Welcomed

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is today welcoming the government's decision to introduce legislation placing a moratorium on the number of universities, until the work of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) is known.

"This is a positive step in the direction of a collaborative higher education sector," said Sam Huggard, Co President of NZUSA.

"The tertiary sector has been left directionless by the previous government, and a competitive environment festered, which came at the expense of institutions, staff, students and the public alike."

"We believe than universities and polytechnics both have a positive role to play in higher education, and that they should focus on their strengths rather than competing to do too much. TEAC has been asked to come up with strategic advice on the shape of the tertiary sector, and it is fitting that a moratorium on grants on university status be put in place until TEAC has reported its findings."

"This move, combined with the work of TEAC, and an upcoming coming review by the Education and Science Select Committee on student fees, loans, allowances and overall tertiary resourcing, indicate that the government is willing to follow through with their desire to end the competitive model in tertiary education," concluded Sam Huggard.

Ends.
