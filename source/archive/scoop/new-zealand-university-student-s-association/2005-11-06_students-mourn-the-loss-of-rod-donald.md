Students mourn the loss of Rod Donald

The student members of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) are shocked at the loss of Green Party Co-leader Rod Donald who had been a long time supporter of students.

“Rod Donald was a firm and constant supporter of students and student causes and never failed to respond when asked to help either student welfare or the standards of tertiary education,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of NZUSA.

“He was a lovely and intelligent man who was never too busy to meet with student leaders and discuss our campaigns,” said Belich.

“Students always gave Rod Donald a warm welcome and even those who disagreed with his policies respected him for determination, good humour and style,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of NZUSA.

Rod Donald was to address a meeting of student presidents from throughout the country this coming Wednesday. NZUSA staff and members send out their deepest sympathies to Mr Donald’s family and the Green Party.
