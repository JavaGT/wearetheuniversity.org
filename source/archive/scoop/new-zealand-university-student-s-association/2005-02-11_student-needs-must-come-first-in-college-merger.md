Student needs must come first in Christchurch College merger

Student leaders are today calling on the Christchurch College of Education and the University of Canterbury to ensure that the proposed merger between the two institutions does not disadvantage students. The decision to seek a merger was announced in a statement today by the Christchurch College of Education (CCE).

“College students should not be expected to pay higher fees as a result of this merger, and we are calling on both institutions to ensure this does not happen,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“The merger should only go ahead if students from both institutions benefit and the quality of teacher education is not compromised,” said Kirton.

“The length of time spent on practical placement and student support services available to College students must not be cut as a result of this merger,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of NZUSA.
