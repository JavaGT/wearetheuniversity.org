NZQA CEO Good News For Tertiary Education
=========================================

**Thursday, 23 September 1999, 3:30 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand University Student's Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association)**

The New Zealand University Students' Association today welcomed news that Dr Norman Kingsbury would become Chief Executive of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) as "a positive step for tertiary education quality and students".

"Dr Kingsbury has an outstanding knowledge and level of expertise in education quality matters," said NZUSA Co-President Karen Skinner. "He also has considerable management experience, and is keenly aware of student issues and concerns."

"The New Zealand Qualifications Authority has a vital role to play in maintaining and improving quality in tertiary education, particularly in an environment where resources are very stretched and the temptations to cut quality corners are increasing," continued Ms Skinner. "The poor leadership of NZQA over the past few years has therefore been a source of considerable concern to us. We are very happy to see someone of such talent - and one of our alumni - take over this important position, and we wish him the best."
