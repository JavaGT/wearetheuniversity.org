Raukawa-Tait Should Resign
==========================

**Friday, 15 February 2002, 12:18 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand University Student's Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_University_Student's_Association)**

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is appalled by Merepeka Raukawa-Tait’s decision to stand as a candidate for the Christian Heritage Party.

‘Merepeka Raukawa-Tait has made a mockery of Women’s Refuge principles. She has been very outspoken about violence against children, but has now joined a party which believes in using physical violence as discipline’, said Anna McMartin, NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer.

McMartin is concerned at the Christian Heritage Party’s anti-homosexual stance. ‘Merepeka Raukawa-Tait can’t actively support a party that discriminates against lesbian women, yet claim to be a women’s advocate’, she said.

NZUSA is calling on Merepeka Raukawa-Tait to resign from her position as Women’s Refuge head.
