Discriminatory Sticker Scheme To End

"Students will welcome today’s decision from the police to end their blatant discrimination of young people by putting a stop to their Under 25 ‘catch a car thief’ sticker scheme," said Tanja Schutz, Co President of the New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA).

The Police confirmed today that they would no longer promote the scheme, following advice from the Human Rights Commission that it may breach the Human Rights Act.

"We are pleased that this discriminatory scheme will come to an end," said Tanja Schutz. "The police failed to adequately consult with young people before implementing the scheme, they failed to ensure that it did not breach the Human Rights Act and the have failed to prove that the program was even successful to any great extent. Today’s announcement is an embarrassment for the Police."

"Any initiatives or which contravene basic human rights are not acceptable. This scheme negatively stereotyped young people and set a dangerous precedent for discrimination."

"Who were the police thinking of discriminating against next" said Tanja Schutz.
