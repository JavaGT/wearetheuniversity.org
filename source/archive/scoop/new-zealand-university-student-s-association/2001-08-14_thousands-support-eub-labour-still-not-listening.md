Thousands support EUB – Labour Still Not Listening

Thousands support EUB – Labour Still Not Listening

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) will present a petition to Alliance MP Liz Gordon at 1.10pm today on the steps of Parliament, calling on the Government to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) for all tertiary students who cannot find work over the summer holiday period.

“It is inequitable that if a student is unemployed over the summer period they cannot automatically receive an unemployment benefit. Any other New Zealander unemployed over that same period can. The current provisions are clearly discriminatory,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

NZUSA ran a nation-wide campaign calling on the reinstatement of the EUB over the first few months of the year. The petition of 7446 signatures was collected as part of the campaign.

“The signatures on this petition represent the view of many New Zealanders that the current government policy of saying to students we won’t provide you with financial support until you can show us you are really hard up is archaic and mean spirited,” said Campbell.

“Tomorrow the government will announce a new summer work programme for students. This is a step in the right direction in helping to get students into jobs, however the programmes will not create full employment and there will always be some students who cannot find work. Why shouldn’t unemployed students have access to an unemployment benefit?” said Campbell.

“NZUSA will be campaigning hard again this summer. The pressure will be on Labour to justify to students, the public and their own coalition partner why they think unemployed students shouldn’t be entitled to any income.”
