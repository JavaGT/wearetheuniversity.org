Student Debt Funds Budget Surplus

Students are disappointed that the Government hasn’t used its significant surplus to meet its election promise of meaningfully increase support to students.

“Students have been waiting too long for meaningful increases in student support from Labour”, stated Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

“The total number of students receiving an allowance has dropped by 20% between 2000 and 2005. That is a drop in government funding of allowances of $79 million dollars. It is no wonder that student debt continues to increase as more and more students are force to borrow in order to pay rent and by food.”

“Additional funding increases of $28.9 million in all forms of student support is still going backwards.”

Labour promised last election that they would ensure that 50% of full time students would receive allowances; it is currently less than 30%.

“NZUSA is calling on government to honour its manifesto pledge of 50% access to student allowances.” concluded Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).
