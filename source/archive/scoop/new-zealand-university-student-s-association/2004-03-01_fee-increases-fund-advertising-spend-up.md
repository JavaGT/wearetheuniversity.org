Fee increases fund advertising spend up

Tertiary institutions are spending more and more public and student money on advertising themselves at the same time as raising student fees, according to new figures released today by the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“Last year public tertiary institutions spent more than ever before on competing with each other,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA. “AC Nielsen data shows that advertising placements alone have grown by 83% since 1999.”

“This advertising spree is being funded through student fees hikes and led by big spenders such as Otago and Massey Universities” said Fitzsimons. “However, all the evidence shows that very few students are influenced by advertising.”

“Each year since 1999, there have been increases in the amount of money spent by institutions on advertising despite the fact that we are supposed to be in a more collaborative environment.”

“AC Nielsen figures are just a drop in the bucket of massive marketing budgets. It’s time for this madness to end and for universities, polytechnics and colleges of education to stop wasting money on advertising. The savings could then be used to reduce tuition fees and student debt.”

“The government and the Tertiary Education Commission should rein in this irresponsible use of student fees immediately” said Fitzsimons.
