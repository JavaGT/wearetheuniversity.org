Great victory for Southland students

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is describing the result of the membership referendum at Southland Institute of Technology as a great victory for all Southland students.

“Southland students have made a great decision for the future of education in the region,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President if NZUSA. “A new strong student voice in the deep south – especially from an institution with no tuition fees – will strengthen the student movement everywhere.”

“We’re thrilled that we were able to support the local students in mobilising a strong desire for a student association,” said Fitzsimons. “We had a great time in Invercargill working with committed and enthusiastic locals who were eager for change.”

NZUSA would also like to acknowledge the support given to Invercargill students from Dunedin student organisations.

“We know students can affect change when we work together. Our current campaign for a living allowance for all students is one example of students working together for a common goal,” said Fitzsimons.

“We hope Southland students will use their new association to put more pressure on the government for fairer student support policies.”
