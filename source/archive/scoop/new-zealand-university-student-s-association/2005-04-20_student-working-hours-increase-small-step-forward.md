Increase in international student working hours a small step forward

Students are today labelling the changes to the number of hours international students can work while studying (from 15 to 20 hours) as a small step towards addressing the needs of these students while they study in New Zealand.

“International students will be pleased that the amount of time they can work per week has gone up to a more realistic level of 20 hours,” said Camilla Belich, Co-president of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“We have been fighting for this change for sometime and it is good to see that the Government has finally listened,” said Belich.

International students often face substantial increase in fees while they are studying in New Zealand, meaning many are forced into financial hardship and poverty.

“These changes will be meaningless for international students unless the Government also introduces a policy of ‘grand-parenting’ of international student fees immediately,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-president of NZUSA.
