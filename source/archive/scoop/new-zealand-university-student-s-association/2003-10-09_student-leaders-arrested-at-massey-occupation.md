Student leaders arrested at Massey occupation

Up to ten students have been arrested after the student occupation of the Massey University Registry protesting fee rises.

Arrested students include New Zealand University Students’ Association Co-President, Fleur Fitzsimons, and Massey University Students’ Association President Andrea Grant.

“We question the police and the university’s handling of this protest,” said Roz Connelly, Co-President of NZUSA. “We understand from eyewitness accounts that there was very limited negotiation of the situation before arrests were made. We will be following up today’s actions with the appropriate bodies.”

“The fee increases at Massey and elsewhere have been unecessary and unjustified. We support students standing up for their rights to not be milked as cash cows to fund bigger and bigger surpluses for tertiary institutions.”
