Teaching Excellence Needs Investment As Well

Students today welcomed the release of the partial Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) round however warn that funding of teaching needs to keep pace with the funding of research.

“It is important that excellence in research is encouraged but a lack of investment is currently working against teaching excellence in our Tertiary Institutions,” stated Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.

“Students have continuously been expected to pay ever increasing fees while government investment has sadly lagged behind. Relying only on students to bridge this gap is a failed strategy than simply reduces access and burdens graduates with mounting levels of debt.”

“Greater public investment is needed in order to ensure excellence in tertiary teaching and ultimately the high quality graduates that New Zealand needs.”

“The tertiary reforms will not deliver greater quality and relevance for students and their communities if public investment in teaching is not increased,” concluded Randall.
