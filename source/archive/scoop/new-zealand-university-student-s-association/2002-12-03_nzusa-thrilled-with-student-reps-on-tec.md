NZUSA thrilled with student reps on TEC
=======================================

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is thrilled with today’s announcement that students will now be represented on the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

“NZUSA has campaigned hard for students’ right to be heard for the last two years,“ said 2003 Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons. “We look forward to engaging with tertiary decision making at the highest level and believe that we have a lot to contribute.”

“We acknowledge the political work behind today’s announcement, particularly that of the Green Party and Nandor Tanczos. Labour have been reluctant to include students in the intermediary body, and we are happy that they have come to appreciate the value of student representation.”

Students also welcomed the support of National tertiary spokesperson Simon Power, who moved an amendment to the Tertiary Education Reform Bill to include student representation.

“Although we are pleased with the establishment of the student advisory committee, we are still concerned that the student member of the TEC is non voting,” said Fitzsimons. “However, with continued quality participation by students in the TEC, we are hopeful that the non voting status will be reviewed.”

“Now we have won the right to be heard, students are keen to get around the table with their fellow commissioners and get started on the issues of quality and access in tertiary education.”
