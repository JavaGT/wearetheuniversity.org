End Rape And Violence On International Working Women's Day

NZUSA is calling on all university women to wear black on Thursday 8 March (International Working Women's Day) and demand a world without rape and violence.

The New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) has co-ordinated a national campaign for International Working Womens Day in conjunction with local campuses. The campaign involves t-shirts, badges, posters and stickers emblazoned with the message "Thursdays in Black: demanding a world without rape and violence".

"Demanding a world without rape and violence starts in your local community." NZUSA National Women's Rights Officer Dayna Berghan said. "Thursdays in Black was started by the Mothers for the Disappeared in Argentina and is very relevant on International Working Women's Day."

Activities on campuses celebrating International Working Women's Day and stalls for Thursdays in Black are planned in Auckland University, Waikato University, Massey Albany, Massey Palmerston North, Victoria University, Lincoln University and Otago University.

"The t-shirts sell for $25 and five dollars raised from each t-shirt goes to support local anti-violence and rape support groups. It's not charity - its positive action" said Ms Berghan. "By making a visible stand in our local community on Thursdays we raise awareness nationally."

For details of activities taking place at your local university campus please contact the Students' Association of that university and ask to speak to the Women's Rights Officer.
