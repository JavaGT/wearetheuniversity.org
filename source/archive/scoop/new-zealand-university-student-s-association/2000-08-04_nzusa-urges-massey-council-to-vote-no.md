NZUSA urges Massey Council to vote no to repositioning proposal

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) fully supports both staff and student action today condemning the "repositioning" exercise currently undertaken by Massey University.

"The repositioning process has been a knee jerk reaction to student enrolment patterns and over zealous think big projects - at the expense of staff jobs," said Tanja Schutz, Co President of NZUSA

"The dictatorial approach taken by Massey management has been the subject of nation wide criticism," said Tanja Schutz. "Overall this reflects badly on the University’s reputation. Students will hardly flock to an institution that’s prepared to compromise on quality and diversity of education."

Our message today to the council of Massey University is to show reason and vote no to the repositioning proposal. Although it has been ‘toned down’ since the initial proposal, it still represents a significant attack on the quality of a Massey degree.

"We urge the council to VOTE NO TO STAFF CUTS," concluded Tanja Schutz.
