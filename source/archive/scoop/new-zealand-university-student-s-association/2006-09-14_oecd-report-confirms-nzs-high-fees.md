OECD Report Confirms NZ’s High Fees

A report released by the OECD highlights New Zealand’s incredibly high tuition fees noted the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

“This report shows just how high New Zealand’s tertiary tuition fees are,” said Conor Roberts, Co-president of NZUSA.

“When the OECD compared us with other countries, it highlighted our high fees and comparably low levels of government funding of tertiary education.”

“Whilst New Zealand has a high level of participation in tertiary, we also have a high drop out rate. Participation is not good enough, students need to be supported to achieve in Tertiary Education.”

“Charging students such high fees makes it hard for students to stay in study and that is part of the reason for our high drop out rate.”

“We call upon the Government to immediately increase its contribution to public tertiary education in order to fund the tertiary education system that New Zealand needs.”

“It is no surprise that those countries with high public funding of tertiary education and low fees, have a high GDP and low drop out rates. An adequately funded Tertiary Education system is important for our economic and social future,” concluded Mr Roberts.
