Cabinet papers give little hope to students

Cabinet papers released to the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) under the Official Information Act show that the government is trying to "manage" expectations and promote the effectiveness of current student loan policies instead of delivering real change for students and their families.

"Students are calling on the Labour Party conference to support a living allowance for all students through the Government's student support review," said NZUSA Co-President Fleur Fitzsimons.

The cabinet paper predicts that the Government's Discussion Document would be met with cynicism as it does not contain concrete proposals for change and is "attempting to close off such options such as a universal student allowance."

"The last thing Labour should be doing is ruling out a living allowance for all students," said Fitzsimons. "Labour Party members should tell their Minsters that a universal allowance should be the goal of their review."

"Students will not be 'managed' by this government and the New Zealand public will not believe their lines about how great the student loan scheme is," said Fitzsimons.

"New Zealanders are well aware of the destructive effects of student debt on the New Zealand society and economy. It is time the government woke up to this fact and delivered meaningful change for students."

"Public opinion is behind students' call for a living allowance for all. Pressure is growing for Government to take action," said Fitzsimons.
