Students To Have No Say

Students To Have No Say In The Future Of Tertiary Education

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is calling on the Government to include student representation on the Tertiary Education Commission, the proposed new body to fund, evaluate and monitor the sector recommended in the long awaited report of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC).

“Students must have a say in the development of tertiary education. The initial TEAC report identified that the needs of learners are central to the design of the system. The needs of learners will not be central if students are not on the commission,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

The TEAC report recommends a Tertiary Education Commission be established to provide strategic direction and cohesion for the sector with a board that will be made up of 12 ministerial appointments. The proposed commission forms the corner stone of the TEAC report that in effect will dismantle the competitive market driven model of the last 10 years.

“Competition in tertiary education has not served students well, and we are glad to see the back of it. The Tertiary Education Commission has a major task ahead in transforming the sector. This change will need the input of the key stakeholder in the sector – students,” said Campbell.

“The Tertiary Education Commission will have far-reaching and important powers. Current government appointments may have a commitment to public tertiary education, but a future National Government could potentially turn it into an elitist education round table,” said Campbell

“The Government has just moved back to elected health boards and there are representative bodies right throughout the education sector. The government should show consistency by creating a accountable democratic commission,” said Campbell
