Massey’s 10% fee rise outrageous

The New Zealand University Students’ Association is condemning a move by the Massey University Council to raise all current fees across the board by 5% and to apply to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) for an additional 5% across the board rise.

“This move by the Massey University Council is recklessly irresponsible and shows contempt for current students and future Massey Graduates,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“Students at the three Massey campuses in Albany, Palmerston North and Wellington will suffer hundreds of dollars in fee hikes next year as a result of this move,” Kirton said.

The vote at the Massey Council meeting today passed 10 to 5 after the fee setting meeting was surprisingly brought forward one month to the shock of Massey students.

“This move will have huge implications for total student debt which is currently way over $7 billion. Political parties have admitted this election that student debt is a huge social issue and the Massey decision today will just make it worse,” said Kirton.

“We hope the Tertiary Education Commission has more sense than the majority of the current Massey Council and rejects Massey’s claim for a further 5% fee increase,” Kirton said.
