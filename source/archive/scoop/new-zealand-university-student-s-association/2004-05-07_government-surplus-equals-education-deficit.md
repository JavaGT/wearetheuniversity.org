Government surplus equals education deficit

“The government’s record surplus announced today is a disgrace given only one third of students are eligible for a living allowance to pay for their food and rent,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association.

“A huge surplus is the perfect opportunity for the government to invest in the future by introducing a living allowance for all students.”

“Students are sick of the excuses from Labour over allowances, it is about time that the government listened to students and their families and addressed the drivers of huge student debt by delivering a living allowance for all students.”

The government surplus is now $7.4 billion according to figures released by Treasury today.

“The government can no longer afford to ignore the problems associated with student debt,” said Fitzsimons “Student debt threatens our society and economy with graduates heading overseas in droves and people putting off having children because of their student loan debt.”

“Eighty percent of New Zealanders support a living allowance for all students, the government has a massive surplus and student debt is spiralling out of control: the time is right for a living allowance for all students,” said Fitzsimons
