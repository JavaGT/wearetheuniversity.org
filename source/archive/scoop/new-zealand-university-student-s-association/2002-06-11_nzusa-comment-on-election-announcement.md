NZUSA Comment On Election Announcement
======================================

Student Loans D Day July 27

The New Zealand University Students’ Association is calling for a coalition government after the July 27 election to ensure the introduction of universal student allowance and the reduction of fees.

“Currently the Labour party does not support a universal student allowance or decreasing fees. NZUSA will be pushing for the next government to be a coalition government with parties who do favour these policies, not a Labour majority government,” said Campbell.

“Student debt has increased by $2 billion under this Labour led government. Average loan repayment times are now 15 years for men and for 28 years for women. All the Labour led government has done is reduce the interest rate for those loan borrowers still studying and hold fees at their highest levels ever. The time has come to address the drivers of debt, high fees and lack of allowances,” said Campbell

“This election should be viewed as a referendum on student loans. If voters support a universal allowance and fee reductions then they should vote for parties that are actually offering these as policy alternatives,” said Campbell.
