Massey University 'repositioning' 2nd draft still unacceptable - Students

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) said that it remained firmly opposed to the "repositioning" exercise currently being undertaken by Massey University, despite a softening of the proposed job cuts announced in tonight's second draft.

"It would be dangerous for people to be lulled into a false sense of security by tonight's announcement of fewer staff cuts at Massey University", said Sam Huggard, NZUSA Co President.

"While the proposed number of staff cuts has been reduced from 116 to 86 full time equivalent staff, this still represents a massive reduction in the number of staff at the university. We remain unconvinced that this will not have an adverse effect on the quality of Massey degrees."

"NZUSA is not opposed to the ongoing assessment of the nation's tertiary education needs, but Massey have gone about it in the worst possible way. The process has been thoughtless, blunt and divisive and has left staff with a bitter taste in their mouths. It is wrong for the Vice Chancellor to assert that the proposal represents 'responsible management of the University'", said Sam Huggard.

"NZUSA recently discussed this issue at our second annual conference in Palmerston North. We were firmly opposed to the repositioning exercise then, and nothing has changed with tonight's announcement from Massey University," concluded Sam Huggard.

Ends.
