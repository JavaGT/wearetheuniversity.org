Government should listen to NZEI and introduce a living allowance for all students

The New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) is calling on the government to listen to the concerns of New Zealand Educational Institute (NZEI) members who today voted to adopt a resolution supporting a living allowance for all students.

"The Government should listen to the concerns of teachers about the destructive impact of student debt on the teaching profession, and immediately introduce a living allowance for all students to start dealing with the student debt crisis," said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of NZUSA.

"Our teachers play a crucial role in the education of the next generation, government should recognise this instead of forcing them into massive debts that they will spend decades repaying."

"Teacher graduates arrive in the classroom with a huge debt to pay off and ten percent of their income services student loan repayments, it is not surprising that they travel to countries where the important role that teachers play is properly valued."

"A living allowance for all students would be a fair way to start addressing the student debt monster."
