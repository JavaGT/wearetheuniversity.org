Minister should live on nothing for a week

Students call on Minister to live on  
nothing for a week

  
The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is today calling on Steve Maharey, the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary), to live on nothing for a week, to mark the launch of a nation-wide campaign demanding the reinstatement of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) for student’s over summer.

Student Associations around the country have started a petition calling on the reinstatement of the EUB in the upcoming government budget. Students will also be signing postcards and writing personal messages to the Minister over the coming months.

“NZUSA calls on the Minister to experience what it is like for students when they are unemployed. If he accepts the challenge he will have two choices, he can go and live with his parents or he can starve,” said NZUSA Co President Andrew Campbell.

The EUB was cut by the National Government in 1998, leaving many students with no financial assistance if they were unable to find employment during the summer break. Students are currently the only sector of society ineligible for financial assistance whilst unemployed.

“When the EUB was cut Mr Maharey called it a mean spirited attack on students, however since he has been in Government he has ignored the issue. Perhaps from his 6th floor Beehive office he has forgotten the financial hardship many students experience. A week without cash should remedy that,” said Campbell.

“If the government wants to retain a student friendly image it needs to address the EUB issue. Students are not prepared to go one more summer without it,” said Campbell.

ENDS.
