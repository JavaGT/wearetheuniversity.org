University women demand more rights for working women

Women students are calling on the government to take action on paid parental leave and pay equity this week. University women will be marking International Working Women's Day with various activities to draw attention to these issues this Thursday (March 8).

\"We can't celebrate International Working Women's Day when so many working women are missing out," National Women's Rights Officer for NZUSA Dayna Berghan said. "Women are still only being paid 81 percent of men's earnings. Women in tertiary education want to know that they will have equal opportunities as men once they graduate."

"Women won't be on an equal footing in the workforce until we have paid parental leave. Because you are a mother it doesn't mean you are not working. Paid parental leave is more of a necessity for women graduates simply because they are paying off vast student loans for most of their lives."

The New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) has co-ordinated a national awareness raising campaign for International Working Women's Day in conjunction with local campus activities. Posters and postcards to the Hon Margaret Wilson, Minister of Labour calling for pay equity and paid parental leave will be distributed on campuses.

Activities are planned for Auckland University, Waikato University, Massey Albany, Massey Palmerston North, Victoria University, Lincoln University and Otago University.

"The activities planned for each university tie in with other local women's collective initiatives" continued Ms Berghan "UNIFEM always have a breakfast, the local universities will have lunch time forums, the Human Rights Commission are holding events, and the local women's collectives will have a range of night time activities. There should be something for everyone."
