Students To Hold Loan Debt Summit  
Days Before Election

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) in association with the Minister of Youth Affairs, Laila Harré, will host the third student debt summit in Auckland on Tuesday July 23.

The debt summit will focus on the future impact of student loan debt and what solutions political parties are offering for the student debt crisis in the upcoming election.

“This debt summit is an opportunity for us to focus on the current debt problem, look at what its impact will be if left unchanged and investigate solutions to the problem,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell.

The summit will also look at future economic, population, workforce and equity impacts of the scheme.
