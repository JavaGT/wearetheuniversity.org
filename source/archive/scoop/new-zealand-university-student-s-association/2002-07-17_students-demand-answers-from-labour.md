Students Demand Answers from Labour

The New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA) is calling on the Labour Party to publicly state how many extra students will receive an allowance if they are re-elected into government, after both Steve Maharey and Helen Clark refused to make specific commitment on the issue.

Steve Maharey promised Victoria University students on Monday that tens of thousands more students would receive allowances, then backtracked by refusing to sign a pledge to this effect. The Prime Minister also avoided answering a specific question on the issue on a Sky Television leaders debate.

“The pledge to increase access to student allowances seems to be a low priority for Labour,” said NZUSA Co-President Andrew Campbell. “In the absence of any detail, we are fearful that the number of students set to benefit will be very small.”

“We are receiving feedback from students that they are frustrated at the vagueness of Labour’s policy. Students and their families want an indication of how many additional students will get an allowance so that they can vote wisely on July 27,” said Campbell.

“NZUSA challenges Labour to state how many more students will receive an allowance if they are elected. Why are they hiding from voters on this issue?” said Campbell.
