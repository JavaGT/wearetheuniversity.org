Students warn: access must not be compromised

Students believe that their tertiary education should be of a high quality and are therefore generally supportive of the tertiary education changes announced by the Government today.

"All New Zealanders are entitled to a high quality tertiary education and students are supportive of moves to improve quality. Public and student money should not be spent on low quality provision," said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA).

"However, we would be concerned if the funding shifts initiated by the Government compromised access to quality courses. We ask the Government to ensure that all New Zealanders are able to access a high quality tertiary education," Belich said.

Trevor Mallard announced a number of tertiary education changes today focused on sub-degree provision funding shifts and governance of the tertiary sector agencies.

"Students enrolled in courses or institutions where funding is cut or shifted should not be disadvantaged by these changes," said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.

"We will also be asking that the Secretary of Education ensure that there is a high level of student involvement in the new governance arrangements for tertiary education," Kirton said.
