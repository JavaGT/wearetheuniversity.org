Students support staff strike

Students support the industrial action to be taken by university staff tomorrow. Students fear that without immediate action their lecturers will no longer be attracted to the working conditions in New Zealand universities.

“If New Zealand wants to continue to attract and retain high quality university staff then our staff must be fairly paid. Paying university staff fairly is in the best interests of the whole country, including current and future students,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“National bargaining is the only way to ensure pay parity across the university sector. The Government and university management must work together to ensure that New Zealand has a talented, stable academic workforce,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of NZUSA.

Student representatives will be joining staff on the picket lines around the country tomorrow.
