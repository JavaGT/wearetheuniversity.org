At the mercy of a competitive tertiary sector

Victoria Design and Architecture students at the mercy of a competitive tertiary education sector

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) is disappointed that both staff and students at Victoria University Design and Architecture School were not adequately consulted about the intended sale of their building on Vivian street in Wellington. Today, the Acting Vice Chancellor, Roy Sharp outlined the financial predicament of Victoria University to cost cut at the expense of the internationally recognised school.

"This is a direct result of continual government under funding of the Tertiary education sector, which has resulted in a cut throat competitive environment for institutions. Once again staff and students will bear the full brunt," says Tanja Schutz, Co President, NZUSA.

"The collegial nature and fiscal common sense of two Universities, Victoria and Massey, sharing space, resources and creative inguenuity in one city centre was positive," says Ms Schutz." "Now we are seeing the results of excessive inter institutional competition."

"The building was custom built for staff and students. It seems irregular that the university is dumping a functional architecture and design building, while in the same breath set to invest large amounts of money refitting the new commerce building, Rutherford House," says Ms Schutz.

"In addition, the building was in close proximity to networks within the professional sector. To some extent this move puts the good relationship between the sector and the students at risk."

"The Government should take note that this is a prime example of Universities trying to frantically economise after nine years of outright funding neglect, directly affecting the quality of current and future student’s education" says Ms Schutz.
