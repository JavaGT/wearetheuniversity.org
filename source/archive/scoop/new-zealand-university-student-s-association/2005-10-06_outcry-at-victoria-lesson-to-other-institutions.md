Outcry at Victoria lesson to other institutions

Student outcry over proposed fee increases at Victoria a lesson to other tertiary institutions

The outcry from students and the public that has followed the publicity over the release of a confidential proposal to substantially increase fees at Victoria University next year should be a lesson to other tertiary institution councils planning similar moves.

“The situation at Victoria has proven that tertiary institutions are now willing to do almost anything to keep student fee setting procedures away from public scrutiny, even to the extent of silencing students through the High Court,” said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“The huge increases proposed by Victoria University are shameful. While the institution argues that they can’t afford lower fees, we can assure them that students can not afford the increase.”

“We would urge other tertiary institutions to think carefully before tabling similar proposals,” said Kirton.

“Fees account for approximately 60% of the $8 billion of student debt. Tertiary institutions should join with students and lobby the Government for increased funding rather than hiking up fees,” said Camilla Belich, Co-President of NZUSA.

“We expect students and concerned members of the public to mobilise around upcoming fee setting meetings if this disregard for students by tertiary institutions continues,” said Belich.
