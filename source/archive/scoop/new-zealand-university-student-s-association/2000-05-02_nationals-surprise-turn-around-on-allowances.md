National’s surprise turn around on Universal Allowances

The New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) are very surprised about National’s stance reversal on Universal Allowances. The implementation of Universal Allowances would remove the current situation of means testing students on their parents income until the age of 25, while unemployed people get the unemployment benefit as of right.

“This move from a re branded ‘radical conservative’ party is most certainly welcome, but not if it is to be used as political vote bait” warns Sam Huggard, Co President NZUSA

“It is quite obvious that National needs quality time sitting on the opposition benches to reflect on their numerous bad tertiary policies that has resulted in their demise from Government” says Tanja Schutz Co President NZUSA. “The implementation of Universal Allowances is a good start towards constructive policy that is would benefit students, institutions and the public alike in creating a broad based educated and skilled society”.

“What we are currently witnessing is a marked decline in enrolments and retention which can only be attributed to the financial burden of debt,” says Sam Huggard. “To remedy this current situation, there must be a firm commitment and financial investment for future generations in the budget from the new Government”.

“Otherwise it will not only be students that suffer, but society as a whole.” concluded Sam Huggard
