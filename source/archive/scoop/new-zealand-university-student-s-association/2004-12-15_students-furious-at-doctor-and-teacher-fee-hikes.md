Students Furious at Doctor and Teacher Fee Hikes

Students Furious at Government Imposed Doctor and Teacher Fee Hikes

Students are furious that the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) has agreed to grant institutions permission to charge even higher fees for teachers and doctors in 2005 and warn that serious consequences will flow from this decision.

“This government imposed, back room fee increase is the worst possible news for debt laden students and should be the final nail in the coffin for Labour’s failed fee maxima policy,” said Fleur Fitzsimons, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association.

The TEC has agreed to grant Otago University and Dunedin and Christchurch Colleges of Education special permission to raise fees by 10 percent for 2005.

“Teachers and Doctors cannot afford to face this unjustified fee increase and our country cannot cope with more workforce shortages in education and health as more teachers and doctors head overseas thanks to massive student loans.”

“The decision to raise fees by TEC Official, Max Kerr is undemocratic and shows contempt for students and their families who will be plunged deeper into student debt.”

“Labour have lied to students by condoning fee increases well above the rate of inflation despite claiming on their pledge card at the last election that tertiary education would be affordable under Labour.”

“We call on Minster of Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey to reign in TEC bureaucrat Max Kerr and force him to overturn this unjustified, mean-spirited attack on students.”
