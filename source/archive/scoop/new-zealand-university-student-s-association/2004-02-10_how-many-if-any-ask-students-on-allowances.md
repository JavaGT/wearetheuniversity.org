How many, if any? ask students on allowances

Students are welcoming Helen Clark’s announcement today that more students will be eligible to receive living allowances in 2005, but still have one big unanswered question: how many extra students will receive an allowance?

“It’s clear that the second term of this government will nearly be over before Labour deliver on their promise to extend access to allowances, “ said Andrew Kirton, Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’ Association (NZUSA).

“Students everywhere want to know: how many more of us can expect a living allowance next year instead of being forced to borrow to pay for rent and food?”

“It’s no coincidence that the first new allowances will come in an election year. The public deserves specific information about how many students will benefit - not vague election year carrots,” said Kirton.

“Two thirds of students are currently shut out of government support while studying. All students should be eligible for living allowances, and we will not let Clark and Maharey get away with tiny increases phased in slowly,” said Kirton. “A living allowance for all is the only way to slow down the growing debt monster. “
