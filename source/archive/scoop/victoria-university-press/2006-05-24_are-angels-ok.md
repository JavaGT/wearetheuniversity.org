Are Angels OK?
==============

**Wednesday, 24 May 2006, 11:59 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Press](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Press)**

  
Are Angels OK?

  
The Parallel Universes of New Zealand Writers and Scientists  
Edited by Paul Callaghan and Bill Manhire  
To be launched 31 May and in bookshops 2 June 2006  
NZ rrp $29.95

Are angels OK?’ asked Bill the poet.  
‘Angels are just fine,’ said Paul the physicist.  
And thus began an extraordinary blind date  
between New Zealand writers and physicists.

In this remarkable book, ten leading New Zealand writers (with some help from leading New Zealand scientists) wing their way through:

the sandpile phenomenon . the curvature of space time . wave particle duality . the untimely death of Schrödinger’s cat . Elsewhen . Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle . dark energy . entropy . the arrow of time . quarks . anti-matter . The Death of the Sun and The End of the Universe . . .

The resulting poems, cartoons and short fictions by

Catherine Chidgey \* Glenn Colquhoun \* Dylan Horrocks \* Witi Ihimaera \* Lloyd Jones \* Elizabeth Knox \* Margaret Mahy \* Vincent O’Sullivan \* Chris Price \* Jo Randerson

form a provocative and fascinating reader for science and non-science buffs alike. Since Einstein’s time the world of physics has become a strange, fantastic and sometimes disturbing place – potentially a rich domain for philosophers and artists, the results of these science/literary and artistic collaboration prove this point.

New Zealand launch  
The writers – as well as project directors Bill Manhire and Paul Callaghan – appear at a special one-off event chaired by broadcaster Kim Hill where we’ll find out, over a glass of wine, why our writers and scientists do indeed live in parallel universes.  
7.30pm, 31 May 2006, Paramount Theatre, Wellington  
$12 tickets from http://www.paramount.co.nz or 04 3844080
