Death of Nigel Cox
==================

**Friday, 28 July 2006, 3:55 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Press](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Press)**

It is with great sadness that Victoria University Press wishes to advise that Nigel Cox passed away early Friday morning 28 July 2006.

One of New Zealand's best writers, Nigel was recognised at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards on Monday evening when his novel "Responsibility" was named a runner-up for the Fiction Award. Nigel's eloquent and moving acceptance speech was met with a standing ovation from his family, friends and colleagues in the writing, publishing and bookselling community.

Author of five published novels, "Waiting for Einstein", "Dirty Work", "Skylark Lounge", "Tarzan Presley" and "Responsibility", Nigel had recently completed a wonderful new book called "The Cowboy Dog" which Victoria University Press are proud to publish later in the year.

Nigel is survived by his wife Susanna Andrew and their children, Kate, Andrew-Jack and Frank.

Nigel's funeral will be held at 2pm on Monday 31 July at St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Brougham St. Mt Victoria, Wellington. In lieu of flowers donations can be made to the "Nigel Cox's Children's Trust" c/- Unity Books, 57 Willis St. Wellington and Unity Books, 19 High St. Auckland.

Nigel has been a great friend to all of us at Victoria University Press and we will miss him more than words can say.

ENDS
