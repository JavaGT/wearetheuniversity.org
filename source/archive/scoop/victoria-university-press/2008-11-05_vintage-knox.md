VUP press release

immediate

It’s been 10 years since the award-winning “The Vintner’s Luck” was published. Victoria University Press is proud to publish a strictly limited edition of 1000 copies to celebrate.

This signed, numbered edition is beautifully designed by the acclaimed designer Sarah Maxey and printed with skill and craft by Printlink in Petone.

Casebound, with ribbon and dustjacket, the production is sumptuous.

Along with this lovely celebratory edition of “The Vintner’s Luck”, we’re releasing a collection of Elizabeth’s non-fiction “The Love School: Personal Essays”.

The writing throughout displays the vivid particularity and rich music for which she is renowned, and a number of pieces take surprising imaginative turns: when the fevered author encounters an angelic stranger in a Venetian back street, for instance, or when Elvis Presley encounters St Jerome’s lion.

Both books are published on Friday 7 November.

Please contact Heather McKenzie 027 563 6531 heather.mckenzie@vuw.ac.nz to arrange an interview with Elizabeth, for more information or to receive a review copy of “The Love School”.
