VUP publishes Nigel Cox's Black Comedy

VUP is really delighted to be publishing Nigel Cox's blackly funny new novel Responsibility today. It's a real cracker, with one of the most exciting endings of any book I've ever read!

Responsibility is a darkly comic thriller set in contemporary Berlin. Martin Rumsfield, an international museums expert from New Zealand, is feeling hemmed in by the pressures of work and the demands of family. When a shady character from his past turns up with a sure-fire plan to scam the scammers, Martin is seduced by the glamour of a walk on the wild side. Then, in a shattering moment, he realises that he has put what he values most at deadly risk.

Responsibility is written with delicious ironic awareness of the hardboiled detective fiction clichés which lie behind every twist and turn. But a darker undercurrent of moral consequence is never far from the surface, and it is this that finally returns Martin from self-indulgent fantasy to a deep appreciation that in steady embrace of his responsibilities lies the promise of a richer, truer life.

Nigel 's back in NZ after his stint at the Jewish Museum in Berlin and is available for interview. Please contact me to set up a time or to request a review copy.
