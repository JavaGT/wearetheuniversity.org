"The Fainter" Named one of Best Books in the South East Asia and South Pacific

The Commonwealth Writers' Prize Shortlist was announced Friday 9 February 2007 and Victoria University Press congratulates Damien Wilkins as his novel “The Fainter” is named as one of the Best Books in the South East Asia and South Pacific region. The regional winners are announced on 12th March.

“The Fainter” is the story of Luke, a young diplomat on his first overseas posting. He’s in New York, preparing for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. His photo has appeared in the New York Times. He has a knack for success. Then he witnesses a crime, the fallout from which threatens everything.

Named as “Book of the Week”, Nelson Wattie in the Dominion Post said “Nobody interested in local literature should fail to read this book. Neither should anyone who simply enjoys a beautifully crafted work of fiction”.  
Hedley Mortlock in the NZ Herald described Damien as “a premier writer. Of that there is no doubt. He has a beautiful way, using the gentlest of brush strokes, of conveying human frailties and challenging the reader to stay with him”.
