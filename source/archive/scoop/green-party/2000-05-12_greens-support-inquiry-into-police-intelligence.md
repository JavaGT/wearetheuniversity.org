Greens support inquiry into police intelligence service

Green Party Justice spokesperson Nandor Tanczos said he supports today's call by Professor Jane Kelsey and a large group of individuals and organisations for a select committee inquiry into the role of the Criminal Intelligence Service (CIS) of the police in targeting political organisations and activists.

Dr Kelsey's request to the Justice and Electoral Select Committee following revelations in a High Court case that the CIS had been monitoring University of Canterbury lecturer Dr David Small since the mid 1980s.

Nandor Tanczos is a member of the Justice and Electoral Select Committee.

"I agree with Jane Kelsey that the events which lead to the 'Small' case and the judgement itself warrants a full select committee inquiry into the role the CIS has taken upon itself in relation to the legitimate activities of political organisations and individuals," he said.

"Aziz Choudry's victory against the SIS and Dr Small's victory against the police not only confirm the legitimacy of lawful protest but raise fundamental questions about the mandate and accountability of intelligence agencies.

"It is vitally important for parliament to examine these issues. I will therefore be calling upon the Committee to adopt Dr Kelsey's request at next weeks meeting," he said.
