Greens call on MPs to join the anti-whaling cause

The Greens are asking MPs from all parties to sign a joint letter to the Japanese Prime Minister opposing his government's recent decision to expand its whaling programme.

"The Japanese Government is much more likely to take notice of New Zealand protestations about its whaling if it knows that all our political parties are speaking with one voice," Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said.

"That's why we're asking all MPs to sign a letter to Mr Koizumi, which explains that whales are precious to New Zealanders but are under threat from Japanese whaling practices."

The Japanese Government recently announced it planned to begin killing humpback and fin whales, and increase the number of minke whales it already kills.

"The numbers of whales has diminished from about 100,000 to only a few thousand, and this is a direct result of the whaling undertaken by only a handful of countries, including Japan," Ms Fitzsimons said. "Harpooning is a particularly slow, bloody, and painful death.

"Whales were once a common sight off New Zealand's coast, and tourists and locals are thrilled to see them. However, sightings of whales are becoming more and more rare.

"I find it hard to believe that any MPs are pro-whaling. This letter gives them all, no matter their differences on other policies, an opportunity to stand up for these beautiful animals that New Zealanders hold dear," Ms Fitzsimons said.

Australian Green Senator Bob Brown is organising a similar letter for Australian legislators.
