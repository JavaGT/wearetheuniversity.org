Locke at APEC

Green MP Keith Locke will be in Sydney on Saturday during APEC to underline New Zealand's need to fight for substantive action on climate change, and to take part in the "Stop Bush" antiwar and climate change rally in Sydney that begins at 10am tomorrow morning.

"Already there are signs that Australia and the US are intent on setting only 'aspirational goals' on climate change. They seem equally determined to maintain their destructive presence in Iraq. Helen Clark will need to be carrying to the top table at APEC a strong New Zealand message against the war and in favour of substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions," Mr Locke says.

"I will be in Sydney representing the feeling of many New Zealanders who want APEC to endorse binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and who are appalled at the death and destruction occurring on a daily basis in Iraq.

"In the ANZAC tradition, I will be joining with the many thousands of Australians who are opposed to the illegal war in Iraq, and who will be seeking to highlight the failure of George Bush and John Howard to adequately address climate change, which is the global issue of our time.

"I will be joining the Australian Green contingent on the march. Green Senator Kerry Nettle will be a feature speaker at the rally in Hyde Park," Mr Locke says.

The march begins at 10am at the Sydney Town Hall, and finishes at Hyde Park.
