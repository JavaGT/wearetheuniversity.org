Integrated Ticketing too important to scale back

Aucklanders deserve a decent public transport system that is adequately funded by central Government, Green Party Co-Leader Dr Russel Norman said today.

The Mt Albert by-election candidate is disappointed Auckland’s $80 million integrated ticketing project has to be halved by the Auckland Regional Council because of funding problems.

“The National Government should front up with adequate funding for public transport in the same way they’re happy to front up with money for their stupid Waterview motorway,” Dr Norman said.

“Aucklanders need alternatives to traffic jams and private cars and central Government should provide them, but they just won’t invest the money needed for a decent public transport system.”

Dr Norman said Labour, too, has a “pretty terrible” record on public transport.

“After nine years in Government, Labour failed to fix this one. They spent $5 on roads for every dollar spent on public transport, walking and cycling.

“Frankly, Aucklanders deserve better.”

Dr Norman – who recently launched a Green Party policy of free public transport for secondary school students – said investing in public transport has a far greater benefit/cost ratio than roading projects.

The New Zealand Transport Agency estimates that Auckland’s integrated ticketing project will create $3-$4 dollars of benefits for every $1 spent. This compares favourably with roading projects such as the Waterview Connection, which creates only $1.20-$2.40 worth of economic benefits for every dollar spent.

And making public transport more attractive for tertiary students has great benefits too, Dr Norman said.

In February, 2008 as part of its University Travel Plan the Auckland Regional Transport Authority increased the public transport discount for tertiary students from 20 percent to 40 percent. This discount resulted in:  
• a 67 percent increase in tertiary ticket sales in the 2008 calendar year compared with 2007  
• 1,127 fewer car trips/day to the universities by students in 2008 than in 2006  
• in 2006 only 55 percent of students used PT to get to university - in 2008 62 percent did  
• ARTA calculates that the benefit cost ratio of the University Travel Plan is 38.3 to 1

“The travel plan – which cost $6 million in discounts – has generated more than $200 million worth of economic benefits.

“The benefits of better public transport could not be clearer,” Dr Norman said. “Any Aucklander can tell you how much congestion is reduced during school holidays. The Government doesn’t even know the benefit cost ratio for roading projects but is mindlessly persisting with this tunnel vision approach.”
