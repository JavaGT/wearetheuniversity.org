**Green Party Mana candidate confirmed**

Thursday, 20 January 2011 | Media Release

Paekakariki resident Jan Logie has been confirmed as the Green Party candidate for Mana for the general election..

Ms Logie was confirmed at a Mana Greens branch meeting last night. Ms Logie was the candidate in the recent Mana by-election where she achieved 6.7%of the general vote, 13% of Kapiti and as high as 20% in Paekakariki.

“During the by-election, I loved meeting people throughout the electorate and offering them the Green Solutions. There is a huge opportunity to grow our support and vote in Mana this year. The important issues in Mana are core Green Party issues. Fairness and opportunity, better transport and clean water are key concerns for the community and for the Greens," Ms Logie said.

“As this government’s economic policies increasingly start to bite and the logic of building more roads as a solution is shown to be a sham, the tide will turn to green solutions. Mana deserves solutions that are good for local communities and we have them,” said Ms Logie.

A long-time Wellingtonian, Ms Logie is Development Manager at the New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities, working with city councils and university researchers to help create more sustainable and inclusive cities.

She has previously served as Executive Director of the national YWCA and worked for the Hutt Valley Youth Health Service as well as Wellington's Women's Refuge.
