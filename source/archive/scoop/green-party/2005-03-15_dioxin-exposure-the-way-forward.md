MEDIA ADVISORY  
Dioxin Exposure: The Way Forward

Last week, 28 people exposed to dioxin in the Paritutu were given the results of their blood serum tests. The results showed that their bodies contained levels of dioxin four to six times that of the average New Zealander.

Green MP Sue Kedgley has organised a public meeting on Wednesday night to discuss the significance of the latest blood serum results, and to discuss what should be the next steps to help the affected community who lived near to the Dow chemical plant.

Other speakers include Dr Al Rowland, a geneticist at the institute of Molecular BioSciences at Massey University, Andrew Gibbs, a long time dioxin researcher and campaigner, and Neil Herdson, a former employee of Ivon Watkins Dow, the company accused of contaminating the Paritutu area.

The meeting will look at what practical steps can be taken next to help people and the community who have been affected by dioxin.

Ms Kedgley will be in New Plymouth at 2.30pm and will be available for media interviews if requested.

What: Dioxin Exposure: The Way Forward public meeting  
When: Wednesday 16th March 2005, 7.30 pm  
Where: Hobson Room, Plymouth International Hotel, cnr Courtenay & Leach Streets, New Plymouth
