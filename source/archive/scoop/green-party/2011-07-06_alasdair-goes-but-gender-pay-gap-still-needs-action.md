### **Alasdair goes, but gender pay gap still needs action**

The Employers and Manufacturers Association (EMA) could support law changes to improve pay equity following the dismissal of northern chief Alasdair Thompson, said the Green Party today.

Green Party spokesperson on women’s affairs Catherine Delahunty said Mr Thompson’s dismissal was appropriate given the inaccuracy of his claims about the gender pay gap and his intimidating approach to female journalists, but that the pay gap was likely to continue unless the Equal Pay Act was strengthened.

“The EMA can demonstrate its commitment to pay equity by supporting my members bill and the Human Rights Commission’s proposed bill, both of which will make gendered pay rates more transparent,” said Ms Delahunty.

Ms Delahunty has written a members bill to amend the Equal Pay Act to give it teeth. Equal Employment Opportunities Commissioner Dr Judy McGregor has proposed a similar bill empowering women doing equivalent work to find out what their male colleagues are paid.

“Salary transparency will empower women to negotiate higher wages.

“Mr Thompson’s claim that the changes would be ‘a bureaucratic nightmare’ for employers is ridiculous and unsubstantiated.

“Employers are already required to keep detailed records. How much more time and paperwork would it take to record gender?” asked Ms Delahunty.

Economist Ananish Chaudhuri from the University of Auckland has stated that Ms Delahunty’s bill is an important step forward for achieving the goal of gender pay equity.

“The Green Party invites the EMA to demonstrate they support equal pay for equal work by supporting my members bill and the changes proposed by the Human Rights Commission,” said Ms Delahunty.
