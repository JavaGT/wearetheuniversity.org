National Running Scared In Coromandel
=====================================

**Tuesday, 28 September 1999, 10:54 am**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

ACT has withdrawn from the Coromandel electorate - in a panicked deal with National to shore up the right-wing vote, say the Greens.

Green Party co-leader and Coromandel candidate Jeanette Fitzsimons said an ACT Waikato spokesperson confirmed the party's withdrawal at a public meeting in Waihi on Friday. Up till now, ACT had been advertising for a Coromandel candidate in local media and on their website.

Ms Fitzsimons said ACT pulled out of Coromandel, and earlier from Tauranga, in a two-for-one deal with National.

"ACT stands aside in Coromandel and Tauranga - the two seats National is most worried about, and in return gets a gets a free run at Wellington Central," Ms Fitzsimons said.

An independent poll in Coromandel last month showed Ms Fitzsimons two points ahead of the National candidate.

Ms Fitzsimons said ACT's Coromandel no-show would not change that position as there had been no ACT candidate when the poll was taken.

"We are confident we will win the seat. The poll shows we have the support of the public and this latest move shows National has little confidence in its candidate."
