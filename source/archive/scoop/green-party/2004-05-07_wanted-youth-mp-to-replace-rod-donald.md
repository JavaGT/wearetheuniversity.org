Wanted: Youth MP to replace Rod Donald

Green Party co-leader Rod Donald is advertising this weekend for someone to represent him at the 2004 Youth Parliament to be held in Wellington from 15-17 August.

Mr Donald is looking for a young person aged 16 to 18 who will be a first time voter at the next election. They need to live in Canterbury or Southland, which are the areas he represents for the Green Party.

The Youth Parliament provides 120 young New Zealanders with a once in a lifetime experience. For two days they will act like an MP, holding debates in the chamber, attending select committee meetings and dining at Bellamy's as well as touring Parliament buildings and learning all about the political process. Travel and accommodation are provided.

Rod Donald says he will even lend the successful candidate his matching tie and braces - whether they are male or female!

"Becoming a Youth MP is an extraordinary opportunity to gain a taste of parliamentary life and the role MPs play in our democracy. It also reinforces the importance of participating in the political process.

"As someone who first joined a political party at the age of 16 I would encourage any teenager interested in politics to take up this challenge. You never know where you might end up!" he said.

Young people interested in applying should phone his parliament office collect on (04) 470 6663 for an application form. They will need to write a short essay as well as provide information about themselves and what they hope to achieve at the youth parliament. Applications close on Monday 17 May.

ENDS
