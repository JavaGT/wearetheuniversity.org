**Green Party changes defend public education**

The Green Party is promising to integrate Charter Schools into the public education system as it outlines a caucus reshuffle focussed on defending the public education system and eradicating child poverty.

The major change in the reshuffle is that Co-leader Metiria Turei will take overall responsibility for education, with Catherine Delahunty taking on associate spokesperson responsibilities.

“Our public education system has never been under as much threat as it is from the National Government today and children are the ultimate victims of this,” Mrs Turei said.

“We will vigorously defend our public education system on behalf of children, parents and schools.

“The Salvation Army’s State of the Nation report today revealed the education gap between wealthier kids and poorer kids is growing once again.

“That’s a huge indictment on the John Key Government which seems hell bent on making children, especially poor children, pay the ultimate price for its political agenda.

“We believe that a strong, free, inclusive public education can transform lives, families, communities and societies and is pivotal to eradicating poverty.  
.  
“That’s why two of our most senior MPs will work on education.

“Catherine has done a fantastic job and is a well-respected MP on education in Parliament and within the sector. As Associate she will be responsible for ECE, adult education, Christchurch renewal and curriculum issues,” Mrs Turei said.

Mrs Turei will retain overall responsibility for social issues.

The Green Party also announced it would integrate charter schools into the public education system as soon as there is an opportunity.

“Charter Schools are a waste of money, and are completely counter to everything Kiwis love about our world leading public education system,” Mrs Turei said.

“We will ensure teachers are trained professionals and that every child enrolled at a Charter school is better off under the changes.

“We will stand up for students, parents, schools, and teachers, and introduce creative and innovative policies that fight vigorously for good public education that’s free, and inclusive of all children.

As part of the reshuffle, David Clendon will now have responsibility for the Justice Portfolio and Julie Anne Genter picks up Commerce, Associate Finance and Economics and Associate Climate Change.

David is passionate about Justice and Julie Anne Genter is a rising star regularly embarrassing the Government about its failed case for the Roads of National Significance.
