Campaign closes on a positive note
==================================

Campaign closes on a positive note

  
The Green Party's election campaign officially came to a close tonight with the release of a dozen highlights that MPs hope to achieve over the next three years and a message of support from Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Speaking at a celebration in Wellington, attended by all eight serving MPs and party supporters, Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons outlined 12 areas that the Green Party wanted to focus on in the next term.

"If, as we expect on Saturday, New Zealanders opt for a Labour/Green Government, we believe that together we can create the best New Zealand for all New Zealanders - regardless of where they come from or what their socio-economic status is.

"This campaign has been marked by negative messages. More money has been spent by others attacking and misrepresenting our policies than by us promoting them. However I want to finish as we campaigned, on a wholly positive note.

"The Greens can add substantial value to the next government. We have selected 12 highlights from our policies which we believe are achievable in the next term of Parliament, and which could make a huge difference to the lives of New Zealanders.

"The big economic threats to New Zealand are the end of cheap oil, high student debt and a ballooning balance of payments deficit. Our policies address all three.

"They also address child poverty, clean water and safe food, themes on which we have campaigned for the last year.

Co-Leader Rod Donald read a brief message of support from the Prime Minister, in which she indicated her desire to work alongside the Greens.
