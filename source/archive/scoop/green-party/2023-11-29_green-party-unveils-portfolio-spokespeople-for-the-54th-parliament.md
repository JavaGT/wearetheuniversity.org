Green Party Unveils Portfolio Spokespeople For The 54th Parliament
==================================================================

**Wednesday, 29 November 2023, 9:42 am**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The Green Party is pleased to announce the allocation of portfolios across its largest caucus ever.

“Our team of Green MPs will do everything they can to make sure Aotearoa upholds Te Tiriti and works for everyone,” says Co-leader of the Green Party, Marama Davidson.

“They will bring their vast collective experience, knowledge and skills to shadow the Government’s ministers, to challenge them and hold them to account.

“As the third largest party in Parliament - and with our biggest caucus ever - the Green Party will stand strong on the issues that matter most to our people,” says Marama Davidson.

Green Party co-leader James Shaw added:

“Our team will stand up for an Aotearoa where everyone has enough to pay the rent and put food on the table, where our native wildlife and our oceans are protected for future generations, and where we face the climate crisis with the urgency it demands.

“This is an experienced Green Party Caucus that reflects our priorities for Aotearoa and will provide a strong voice for our people and our planet,” says James Shaw.
