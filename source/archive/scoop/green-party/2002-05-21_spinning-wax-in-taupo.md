Green MP Nandor Tanczos will examine lakeside environmental restoration work, receive a briefing on the health of Lake Taupo and spin some wax at a party when he visits Taupo on Thursday 30 May.

At 10am on Thursday Nandor will visit Waitahanui, 10 kms from Taupo city. Locals will take Nandor to look at the lake-shore reserve restoration work which includes a taniwha sculpture made from a stormwater drain.

At 1.45pm he will speak to the Certificate of Community and Social Work class at Waiariki Polytechnic on the legislative process, MMP, select committees and what its like being an MP.

Nandor will receive a briefing from Environment Waikato on the state of Lake Taupo and other local environment issues.

A public meeting will be held at the Fine Fettle Café, 39 Paora Hapi St from 7.30pm. Nandor's address is entitled 'Building an EcoNation: the Green vision for people, planet and politics'.

"I hope the meeting will provoke some interesting and enlightening discussion," says Nandor.

The local Taupo Green Party Branch are hosting the meeting and ask for a gold coin donation to help cover costs. Refreshments will be available for purchase at the café.

After the public meeting at about 10pm, Nandor will be at Rustix Café, 38 Heu Heu St. Nandor will play a set of reggae, ska and fresh dancehall vinyl between 10pm and midnight, including tracks off the GreenRoom 001 CD just released by the Green Party and LOOP recordings.
