Govt’s big plan for Auckland housing missing the target

News that National’s Auckland Housing Accord is likely to miss its target for the number of homes actually built shows that new ideas under a new Government are needed to fix the housing crisis, the Green Party said today.

The Housing Accord’s three-year target of 39,000 new homes and sections is reportedly likely to fall short by around 1,000, with just 7,000 actual new builds in the last year, [according to Radio New Zealand](http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/319591/auckland-housing-accord-set-to-miss-target).

“The Housing Accord was National’s flagship policy to fix the Auckland housing crisis and it clearly isn’t working,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

“John Key and Nick Smith have spent three years trumpeting the Special Housing Areas (SHA), but there are now [almost 100 Auckland suburbs](http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/319542/more-of-auckland-joins-million-dollar-club) where the median price is over $1 million and some SHAs still don’t have any new homes built in them.

“The Government’s supply-side ‘fix’ to the housing affordability problem is failing and the home-ownership dream is now more out of reach for working families than ever before.

“Areas like Waitakere used to be affordable for families on average incomes but now there aren’t any western suburbs with median prices less than the $600,000 Kiwisaver Homestart limit.

“While the Housing Accord hasn’t fixed the supply side problems, the Government has also largely ignored potential demand-side measures to address property speculation and overseas investment.

“A capital gains tax (excluding the family home) and a ban on non-resident overseas investors are the best steps to help dampen property speculation.

“In government, the Green Party will open the toolbox and build thousands of affordable homes, and make some available to first home buyers through a [progressive ownership](https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life) rent-to-buy programme.

“When even young families with good incomes can’t afford to buy a home in Auckland, the Green Party will help them by putting their [student loan repayments on hold](https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/fairer-society/faster-into-homes) while they save for a first home deposit,” Mrs Turei said.
