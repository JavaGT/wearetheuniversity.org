National must act now to stop workplace abuse

[Today’s report on migrant exploitation](http://media.wix.com/ugd/2ffdf5_28e9975b6be2454f8f823c60d1bfdba0.pdf) shows that the Government is not doing enough to protect workers or to weed out dodgy employers, the Green Party said today.

The University of Auckland’s report consists of more than a hundred interviews with migrant workers showing that abuse, underpay, excessive overtime and threats are commonplace in industries like horticulture and hospitality.

“This report echoes what we have known for a long time; National’s refusal to properly look after people on temporary work visas is having serious consequences,” said Green Party immigration spokesperson Denise Roche.

“Exploitation and abuse of migrant workers has been an open secret for a long time, but National refuses to take the necessary steps to prevent further abuses happening, by ensuring amnesty for people who come forward.

“We cannot reasonably expect people to report abuse and exploitation to the authorities if they face being deported as a result.

“If this Government wants to prevent this kind of abuse from getting worse, they need to properly resource the labour inspectorate to ensure that dodgy employers are held accountable.

“At present, nearly one in five investigations into suspected breaches of minimum employment standards are not completed within six monthsof the complaint being made.

“National has also made it easier for exploitative employment situations to happen by hampering unions’ efforts to provide advice and support to people who want to speak up.

“It’s just not the Kiwi way to stand idly by while people are overworked and underpaid. All workers deserves to be treated with respect and dignity,” said Ms Roche.
