Lamb Tariffs Expose APEC Farce Says Green Party
===============================================

Press Release  
8 July 1999

The Green Party says President Clinton's decision to impose tariffs and quotas on New Zealand lamb imports to the United States is another nail in the coffin of free trade.

"Clinton's decision to slap tariffs on New Zealand lamb exposes APEC for the farce that it is," says Green Party Co-Leader Rod Donald.

"New Zealand taxpayers will be questioning why the Government is spending $44M to host APEC when its biggest player thumbs its nose at our farmers.

"National's love affair with free trade has well and truly turned sour.

"President Clinton's determination to put his own farmers first also > exposes the callous way the National government has treated small businesses and workers in New Zealand.

"Tens of thousands of jobs, particularly in manufacturing, have disappeared in the last decade because of National's fixation with free trade.

"Removing all protections from the New Zealand economy has been a disastrous strategy in the context of other governments managing trade in > the best interests of their own people," he said.
