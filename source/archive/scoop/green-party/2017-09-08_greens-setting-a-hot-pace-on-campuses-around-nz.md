Greens setting a hot pace on campuses around NZ

The Green Party has been setting a hot pace with its election campaigning on campuses around New Zealand – and it’s about to heat up even more from next week.

“The whole reason I'm in politics is to remind people of their power - so a big focus of our activity has been about encouraging the disenchanted and the disengaged, who are so often young people,” says Greens candidate Chlöe Swarbrick.

“With early voting opening on Monday 11 September I’ll be dedicating the next fortnight to engaging with people on University campuses throughout the country, aiming to strengthen participation, conversation, and our democracy”.

“At various stages before the election I’ll be on campuses in Canterbury, Otago, Waikato, Wellington and Auckland to carry that crucial message and to speak on issues that the Green Party has been campaigning on”.

“It’s been so heartening to see thousands of students turning out at our events over the past few months, asking challenging questions and taking a stake in the politics that impacts their future".

The Greens student campaign coordinator Mona Oliver says more Green Party stalls were in place for July’s Re-O (Re-Orientation) Week than ever before and that the momentum has been building from there.

Overall the Green Party's campaign hit the milestone last week of making 100,000 points of contact through its nationwide ground campaign of door-knocking and phone calling.

Otago - September 12-14
