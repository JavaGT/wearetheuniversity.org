VSM an ideological solution in search of a problem

**VSM an ideological solution in search of a problem**

The decision of John Key's Government to a bill to introduce Voluntary Student Membership ignores public opinion, the Green Party said today.

“Over 90 percent of the almost 5000 submissions were in favour of retaining the universal membership model. National has chosen the ideological track which means students will have an even harder time while studying,” Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Gareth Hughes said.

“There was minimal demand from students or institutions and the overwhelming message for VSM submitters on the bill was that we do not want VSM.

“National has sided with Act in what appears to be an ideological solution in search of a problem.

“There is a certain irony that National and Act see this as an issue of choice, but have removed the choice of students to have the model they want,” Mr Hughes said.

When VSM last came before Parliament a compromise was reached where a students' association could opt to become voluntary if its members wished.

Mr Hughes said there was no justification for the bill on the grounds of freedom of association, given that the Human Rights' Commission considers students' freedom to not associate is protected sufficiently under the current legislation.

“This decision will impact on the quality of tertiary education. Tertiary providers will have to step in to help run services traditionally run by the associations,” Mr Hughes said.

“Students associations will sell assets to make up short term gaps in their budgets, thus making their long term survival even more unlikely.

“The current budgetary restraints imposed on the sector by Minister Steven Joyce mean that representation, welfare and advocacy services—essential services in the eyes of students—will have to be funded by the provider.”

Mr Hughes said that he would try to amend the bill during committee stage to soften the impact on associations
