Green MP brings safe food message to Hamilton

Green MP Sue Kedgley is bringing the food revolution message to Hamilton this week.

On Wednesday, she will be speaking at Waikato University on 'Why we need a food revolution'. She will discuss why so much of our food is bad for our health and is environmentally and economically unsustainable. She will offer solutions for what we can do to improve its quality, particularly the food our children eat, and ensure it is sustainably produced, accurately labeled, drug free and ethically marketed.

On Thursday, she will present a 'Shopping with Sue' supermarket tour. She will give a guided tour through a local supermarket to highlight issues such as:

• how to read and understand nutrition labelling;

• how to avoid purchasing food that may contain genetically-engineered ingredients;

• how to identify cruelty-free products;

• how to purchase locally-grown New Zealand products;

• additives to avoid.
