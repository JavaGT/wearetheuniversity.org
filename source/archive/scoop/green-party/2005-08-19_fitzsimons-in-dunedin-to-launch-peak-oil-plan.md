Fitzsimons in Dunedin to publicly launch Peak Oil plan

Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons will be in Dunedin on Monday to publicly launch the Party's plan to prepare for 'Peak Oil', the end of cheap oil.

"The price of oil is now over $60 a barrel, two years ago it was $30. Petrol at the pump is now $1.40 a litre. We do not believe this is a temporary situation - as oil fields deplete prices are likely to go even higher," Ms Fitzsimons says.

"At Monday night's meeting I will lay out the Green Party's plan to prepare for a future of much higher oil prices and eventual scarcity.

"The single most important thing we must do to secure a sustainable future is to reduce our dependence on oil. We do have options. New Zealand can survive into the post-oil age better than most countries, but as a nation we still largely have our heads in the sand when it comes to oil depletion and climate change, and the opportunities we have to plan for a better way of life."

The meeting will be facilitated by Associate Professor Bob Lloyd, Director of the Energy Studies Programme at the University of Otago.

What: Public meeting on The Greens' Plan to Prepare for the End of Cheap Oil

When: 7.30pm, Monday 22 August

Where: Archway 3, University of Otago, cnr of Union St East & Leith Walk, Dunedin.
