**_Where:_** University of Canterbury Ilam Campus, Christchurch.

**_When_**: 1.30pm, Friday 8th July 2016

**_Who:_** Green MP Kennedy Graham, alongside former Prime Ministers, local and international politicians and diplomats, members of the judiciary and citizen activists.

Green MP Dr Kennedy Graham will be speaking on a panel at a symposium to mark the 20th Anniversary of the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) ruling on nuclear weapons.

Twenty years ago the ICJ ruled that the use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of humanitarian law, a historic decision that had been championed by a core group of New Zealanders and other citizen groups around the world.

“This anniversary is an important opportunity to recognise the contribution of passionate citizens to the cause of nuclear disarmament, and consider where to from here,” said Dr Graham.

“The ICJ’s ruling made it clear that nuclear powers must begin negotiating to eliminate nuclear weapons from their arsenals. To date, this is an obligation that they have failed to meet.

“We acknowledge the great progress made on nuclear disarmament since 1996, but our work in this area is not yet finished,” said Dr Graham.

Public and media are both welcome, and the event is free. To RSVP please contact [douglas.horrell@canterbury.ac.nz](mailto:douglas.horrell@canterbury.ac.nz).
