Pamphlet reveals true agenda of pro-beating lobby

Green Children's Issues Spokesperson Sue Bradford says she is deeply disturbed that a pamphlet advocating the beating of children with implements has been distributed in an Auckland school.

"In a democracy, I accept accept the right of the pro-beating lobby to say what they want, but I am very concerned that their dangerous propaganda has been distributed by Carey College in Panmure," Ms Bradford said.

"Schools simply should not be encouraging their parents to beat their kids with rods, especially given that we live in a country with one of the worst rates of violence against children in the developed world."

Ms Bradford said the pamphlet, written by Family Integrity's national director Craig Smith, was based in a "menacing theology".

"The pamphlet and the Family Integrity website seem motivated by the premise that children are born evil and need to have their sin beaten out of them. I reject absolutely the idea that parents have a God-given right to beat the evil out of their kids. I'm sure the vast majority of Kiwi parents, including the vast majority of Christians, would agree with me that this theology is both extreme and dangerous."

Ms Bradford said the pamphlet exposed the real agenda of the pro-beating lobby, and showed why her Section 59 Repeal Bill was necessary.

"Opponents of my Section 59 Bill say they are worried about loving parents who occasionally lightly smack their kids being criminalised. This pamphlet reveals that, for some, what they're really worried about is losing what they see as their God-given right to beat their children, with rods if necessary.

"This pamphlet strengthens the case for my Bill. It illustrates the extent to which supporters of the Section 59 wish to encourage parents to use the defence of 'reasonable force' as cover for seriously beating their kids."
