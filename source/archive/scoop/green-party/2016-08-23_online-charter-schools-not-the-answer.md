Online charter schools not the answer
=====================================

**Online charter schools not the answer**

Government plans to open up the Correspondence School Te Kura to corporate entities or charter schools could have terrible consequences for the quality of education that children receive, the Green Party said today.

National’s Education (Update) Amendment Bill introduced today will change how education is delivered in Aotearoa. This includes creating Communities of Online Learning (COOL) that will threaten the existence of the Correspondence School Te Kura.

“Online charter schools that use public money for private profit don’t provide the education that students need,” Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.

“Student success relies upon high quality teachers and engagement, but this Bill opens the way for an unstructured online learning that undermines this.

“Putting more money and resources in charter school coffers at the expense of the public education system undermines every child’s education.

“Online learning shouldn’t be pushed on students just because it may be the cheapest option for a company. Children need a Government that takes the responsibility of providing an education seriously.

“While it is positive to be having a discussion about the purpose of education, giving money to private companies is not the answer.

“It is positive that the Bill opens a discussion about the purposes of education as an important first step,” Ms Delahunty said.
