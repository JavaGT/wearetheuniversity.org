Return To Universal Student Association Membership

Return To Universal Student Association Membership Welcomed

Green Party MP and ex-Waikato University student Nandor Tanczos today said he welcomed the decision by Waikato students to return to a system of universal membership of their student asociation.

Waikato University was the first campus to opt for a voluntary membership system and Mr Tanczos said the experiment had been a complete failure.

"I am really pleased that Waikato students have opted to return to a system which provides support and a decent campus culture for all students," said Mr Tanczos.

"Entertainment, support and advocacy for students has suffered under a voluntary system, with the association struggling to survive and provide the most basic services for students.

"What has happened at Waikato should be a very clear lesson to all other campuses in this country. Students' associations play a very valuable role on campuses across the country and it is important for students, and the morale on campus, that all students contribute to the needs and welfare of each other."
