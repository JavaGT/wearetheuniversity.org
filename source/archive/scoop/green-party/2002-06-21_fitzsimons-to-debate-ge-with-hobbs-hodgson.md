Fitzsimons To Debate GE With Hobbs, Hodgson
===========================================

**Friday, 21 June 2002, 2:38 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

21 June 2002

Green co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today said she is looking forward to three debates on the GE issue with Environment Minister Marion Hobbs and Science Minister Pete Hodgson.

Ms Fitzsimons will debate Marion Hobbs for 20 minutes live on BFM from 1.20pm on Thursday 27 June. Web users can tune in to the live broadcast through the BFM website www.95bfm.co.nz .

Also on the 27th Jeanette will debate Pete Hodgson for 90 minutes from 7.30pm at the Glenroy Auditorium, Harrop St, Dunedin. This debate has been organised by the Otago Daily Times.

On July 3 Jeanette will again debate Pete Hodgson, this time at a CTU-organised event. This debate will run from 10am - 12 noon at the St John's Conference Centre on the corner of Willis and Dixon Streets.

"I am really looking forward to clarifying what our stand means and correcting some of the misinformation that has been put around," said Ms Fitzsimons.

"Both of these Ministers are committed to lifting the moratorium on the release of genetically engineered organisms into the environment. Voters must understand that if this happens New Zealand will lose its unique GE-Free status forever.

"The Green Party has one bottom line for any post election talks with the Labour Party and that is the extension of that moratorium. This is a very reasonable position and would not be at all difficult for Labour to accommodate, if voters send a clear message," said Ms Fitzsimons.

"The people of New Zealand support the Greens in trying to keep GE in the lab and out of our environment and I am looking forward to putting the Green position alongside the Labour Party's position so that voters can get all the information and decide for themselves."
