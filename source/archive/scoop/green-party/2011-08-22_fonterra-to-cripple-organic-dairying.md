### Fonterra to cripple organic dairying

Fonterra’s move to confine its take of organic milk to the Waikato and Bay of Plenty will cripple New Zealand’s organic dairy sector the Green Party said today.

“Organic dairy is the future of dairy in New Zealand and Fonterra are actively putting off this transition,” Green Party agriculture spokesperson Kevin Hague said.

“Fonterra is using its monopolistic power in a way that massively disadvantages dairy farmers who have converted to organic or who are in the process of converting.

“It will also raise the price and limit availability for consumers who want organic dairy products.

“Organics give New Zealand dairy a competitive advantage for value-added products. Fonterra should be supporting farmers who have, and who wish to, convert to organic farming.

“We need Fonterra to support organic clusters throughout the country. This would eliminate shipping costs and provide the efficiencies that Fonterra is looking for.”

Mr Hague said that given the poor state of our waterways, conversion to organic farming is an easy way to cut nitrate pollution.

“The whole industry needs to clean up its practices because healthy rivers are essential for a healthy economy. Our clean and green brand underpins our dairy industry.  
"Converting to organic dairying is one way to protect and enhance our 100% pure brand, and build a clean green economy that works for everyone," said Mr Hague.
