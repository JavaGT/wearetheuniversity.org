Handover of petition calling for visual fire alarms
===================================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

**Handover of petition calling for visual fire alarms to keep deaf people safe**

**What:** Mojo Mathers accepting petition on visual fire alarms in public places from Deaf Action

**When:** Tomorrow, 3 November 2016, 12:45pm

**Where:** Parliament forecourt

**Who:** Green Party disability spokesperson Mojo Mathers and Deaf Action New Zealand

Tomorrow Mojo Mathers will be accepting a petition from Kim Robinson, Chairperson of Deaf Action New Zealand, that calls for visual fire alarms to be made mandatory in public buildings.

The petition was instigated after the experience of one of Deaf Action’s members, Auckland University student Dean Buckley, who was left behind in a recent fire drill.

“I am fully supportive of this petition and glad to be able to take it to the House for consideration,” said Ms Mathers.

“I have experienced first-hand how unnerving it is to be made aware from others that a fire or smoke alarm is going off, and to realise that if they hadn’t done so, I would not have known.

“I now have a visual fire alarm in my office, which is great, but this should be the norm in all public buildings.

“I will be following the petition closely – Parliament must take fire safety seriously for everyone, including deaf people,” said Ms Mathers.
