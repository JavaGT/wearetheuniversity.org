School closure programme shown to be madness

The overcrowding problem in Otago and Southland schools has shown how stupid the Government's school closure campaign really was, the Green Party says.

"The closure programme was widely opposed by the community as pure stupidity and short-term thinking," Education Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.

"The current difficulties faced by principals in Otago and Southland, proves those community sentiments to be on the mark. The closures caused significant hurt and disruption to teachers, parents and children.

"In closing those schools, the Government forced children to travel longer and further distances, including having to cross major roads, making access to school more dangerous as a result.

"And now it will impact on the quality of access to education as principals put in place zoning schemes to manage increased population," Mrs Turei says.
