MP triking through Canterbury

Nelson-based Green MP Mike Ward is cycling from Bluff to Nelson during the current parliamentary recess to meet with Mayors, councillors, schools, waste organisations, regional business associations, local Greens and the public on the issues of waste, community economic development and transport. He intends to deliver stories from the people he meets to Parliament so as to provide another perspective on what is going on around the country.

"Getting out of planes and motorcars on to my recumbent trike will let me experience the lovelier initiatives around the country on a more intimate level than parliamentary life generally allows," said Mr Ward, the Green Party Spokesperson on Sports, Fitness & Leisure, Local Government, Waste, Tourism and Associate on Transport. The 61-year-old veteran of every Coast-to-Coast race expects the 1021km cycle mission to be straightforward. The North Island leg will follow later in the year.
