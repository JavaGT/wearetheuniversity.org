Govt seeking overseas buyers for Christchurch state homes

The Government is actively seeking overseas buyers for 3,000 state homes in Christchurch, the Green Party said today.

Government officials are hosting an invite-only session for potential investors in Sydney next week.

“It’s bad enough that National is selling our state homes out from underneath some of our most vulnerable New Zealanders, but now they want to sell the land to overseas investors too,” Green Party social housing spokesperson Marama Davidson said.

“National used to say its state house sales were designed to empower local community housing providers, but now it’s clear they just want to flog off the land to the highest bidder.

“This is a huge red flag that the Government’s social housing plan is failing and they’re trying to bring in overseas investors to patch it up.

“The New Zealand community housing sector has the expertise to help solve the housing crisis and we should be working with local organisations, not selling huge amounts of state house land to overseas investors.

“The Green Party’s Home for Life plan shows how we would work with the New Zealand community housing sector to get thousands of new, warm, safe, dry homes built for New Zealanders,” Ms Davidson said.
