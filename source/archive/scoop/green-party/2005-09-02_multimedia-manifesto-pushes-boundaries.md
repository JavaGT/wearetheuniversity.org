MEDIA ADVISORY

Multimedia manifesto pushes boundaries of political communication

The Green Party will continue to push the boundaries in political communication by launching a multimedia manifesto in Auckland on Sunday.

Co-Leader Rod Donald and Information Technology Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos will launch a CD-Rom packed with information about the Green Party's campaign, which will be distributed to thousands of voters during the final two weeks of the campaign.

It opens with an audiovisual message that "time is running out", with music from the track of the same name by Unity Pacific from their critically acclaimed debut album From Street to Sky.

The CD-ROM also has video interviews with the Greens' eight returning MPs, music tracks by Nandor Tanczos and Metiria Turei, as well as policy highlights, candidate information, the campaign billboards and much more.

The video material will also be available from next week, for streaming and downloading, directly via the Green Party's website (www.greens.org.nz).
