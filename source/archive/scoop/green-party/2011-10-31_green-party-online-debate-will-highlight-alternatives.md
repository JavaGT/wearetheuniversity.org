****Green Party online debate will highlight alternatives to National and Labour****

**The Green Party says its online forum and interview with Co-leaders Russel Norman and Metiria Turei that will run alongside tonight’s TVNZ Key/Goff debate provides an alternative for voters who want to hear the Green Party’s perspective on the big issues.**

**_The Green Room starts_ at 7pm with an online panel led by Finlay Macdonald and joined by David Slack, Irene Pink and Nandor Tanczos. Following the Key/Goff debate at 8.30pn Finlay Macdonald will conduct an in-depth interview with Greens Co-leaders Russel Norman and Metiria Turei.**

**The _Green Room_ will be screened on [www.greens.org.nz/Greenroom](http://www.greens.org.nz/Greenroom) and the Green Party Facebook page [http://www.facebook.com/nzgreenparty](http://www.facebook.com/nzgreenparty). People can follow the discussion on Twitter using the hashtag #GreenRoom**

**“The Green Party has clear economic, social and environmental priorities that people aren’t going to hear about on TVNZ,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.**

**“I’m urging people who want to watch the Key/Goff debate to come online at 8.30 to hear what the Greens have to say on the big issues facing New Zealand.”**

**“Our aim is to engage thousands of Kiwis in a broader discussion on politics and inform them of their voting choices in this election.” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.**

**“The _Green Room_ is going to be both informative and fun. I would encourage everyone to come online to check it out,” said Dr Norman**
