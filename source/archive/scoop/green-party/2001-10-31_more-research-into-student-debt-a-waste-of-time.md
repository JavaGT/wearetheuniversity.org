More research into student debt a waste of time

Given that student debt was a key issue at the last election students will be disgusted that the Education and Science Select Committee has failed to recommend any action on student debt, Green Spokesperson on Tertiary Education Nandor Tanczos said today.

"The Select Committee's recommendation that more research be conducted into the effects of student debt is a waste of time. Students need to see some action.

"The facts are clear - student debt is forcing many young people either to leave the country or to live with a lifetime of debt," said Nandor.

"This inquiry took 18 months, thousands of people took part and the end result is a massive disappointment. It takes the issue nowhere and offers no relief whatsoever to students.

"I am disappointed that students' hopes have been raised for nothing and so much time has been wasted," said Nandor.

"The Labour Alliance government has not addressed the fundamental problem - inadequate funding for tertiary institutions and financial support for students," he said.

"The real concerns of students such as universal student allowances, emergency unemployment benefit, and high fees have still not been tackled by this government."
