Greens announce their contribution to a new government

Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today announced nine policies the Green Party expects to contribute to a Labour-led government following the November 27 election.

Speaking at the Green Party's national launch at the Marine Rescue Centre in Auckland this afternoon, Ms Fitzsimons said: \"New Zealanders need a vision and practical leadership and the Greens can provide both. There are a number of unique contributions we would hope and expect to make to a Labour-led government. They are the practical, achievable steps voters can expect if they give us their support."

The steps are:

\* A halt to genetic engineering: No further approvals to genetic engineering field trials or releases until the findings of the Royal Commission have been studied and implemented.

\* Go organic: An advisory service for growers, the changing of research objectives for the Public Good Science Fund and a mortgage guarantee scheme for those wanting to convert their farms.

\* Stop the logging: An immediate cancellation of all the West Coast timber contracts that have been signed in a deliberate attempt to tie the hands of a future government, and a renegotiation of those pre-existing signed earlier in good faith. Pine should be made available for processing on the coast instead.

\* Energy Efficiency: Communities, businesses, local government and citizens groups could be discussing their part in NZ's energy strategy within a few months and the first energy performance standards could be in place in a year.

\* More funding for conservation: In the first budget we would argue strenuously for increased funding for DOC, especially for pest control to protect threatened species.

\* Sustainable transport: A significant shift of funding from new roading to public transport and a reduction of car dependency in cities.

\* Ecological tax reform: We need a shift in what we tax - away from goods like work, income and enterprise and on to bads like waste, pollution and toxics.

\* Alternatives to prisons: An end to building more prisons and a commitment to habilitation and restorative justice.

\* Sustaining fishing communities: A publicly funded multi-stakeholder process for fisheries management.

"Because we are appalled at growing poverty alongside a grossly rich elite; because we want to ensure decent housing, a public health system, stop the punitive work-for-the-dole, and lighten the burden of student loans we have made it clear that we will not support a National-Act government," Ms Fitzsimons said.
