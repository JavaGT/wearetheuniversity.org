Tanczos Tour Not Focussed On Cannabis - Greens
==============================================

**Tuesday, 22 February 2000, 10:36 am**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The campus tour launched by Green MP Nandor Tanczos is not based around encouraging support for cannabis decriminalisation, as is being widely reported.

Only two of more than a dozen engagements at various university and polytechnic campuses have specifically requested that Tanczos speak on cannabis decriminalisation.

Most of his engagements will address much bigger issues such as the need for a restorative justice system, the current state of our environment, radio quotas for kiwi music and serious issues affecting the tertiary sector.

Mr Tanczos said he was pleased the issue of cannabis decriminalisation was finally on the agenda because the current law had no impact on the record number of New Zealanders who used cannabis and provided a barrier for those who needed to seek help for their cannabis use.

Mr Tanczos stressed again that a drug-free life-style was the healthiest.

\"I want to take a number of themes with me to the students of New Zealand," he said. "Young people know there are a number of serious issues facing not only New Zealand but the world. They know that cannabis decriminalisation is a very small issue alongside the issues such as global warming, poverty and the failure of New Zealand's justice system."
