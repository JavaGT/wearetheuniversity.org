**Show us where the money is coming from for charter schools John?**

John Key needs to show the public where the money is coming from for National and ACT’s charter schools roll-out, Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.

Charter schools will be state-funded private schools free from the regulations and accountability currently binding public schools.

“National and ACT’s agreement to set-up and fund this form of private school is a huge policy to spring on the electorate post-election,” said Ms Delahunty.

“There have been no calls for charter schools from parents, and the capacity to be flexible to meet student needs already exists under current law.

“The public needs to know how much money Associate Education Minister John Banks will be getting for National and ACT’s stealthy shake up of the education system.

“The Government must also explain if new spending has been allocated for this project or if the spending will come from existing education baselines.

“State schools in the areas allocated for the trial of charter schools need every cent of the education budget so they can meet the needs of all students.

“If this policy is to come from the already stretched education budget then presumably cuts will have to be made that will affect those schools that are already struggling.

“John Key wanted to know exactly where money was coming from for other parties spending promises on the election trail,” said Ms Delahunty.

“The Key Government must now be upfront with how their policies will impact on the education budget.”
