Greens welcome cage-free commitment from Foodstuffs

The Green Party welcomes today’s [announcement](https://www.foodstuffs.co.nz/media-centre/news-media/foodstuffs-announces-move-to-cage-free-eggs-by-the-end-of-2027/) from Foodstuffs that they will switch to completely cage-free eggs by 2027 in their supermarkets nationwide, and is calling on all supermarkets, to follow suit.

“To have one of New Zealand’s biggest grocery distributors commit to going cage-free is fantastic,” said Green Party animal welfare spokesperson Mojo Mathers.

“This is a strong message that time’s up for cruel cages and colony production.

“Foodstuffs’ leadership will further increase the financial stability for New Zealand’s free-range egg farmers . It also sends a clear message to egg producers not to waste money investing in caged egg systems, such as that proposed by Mainland poultry in the [Waikato](https://www.change.org/p/waikato-district-council-stop-mainland-poultry-caging-800-000-hens).

“Kiwis support free range and they want to know that free range claims stack up, which is why the Green Party is promising to [fix labelling](https://www.greens.org.nz/honest-food)rules so labels can be trusted.

“Business and communities have stepped up for a cruelty-free Aotearoa and the Green Party is committed to providing leadership in Government,” said Ms Mathers.
