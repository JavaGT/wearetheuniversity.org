Ban bad-food ads, urges Kedgley

Green MP Sue Kedgley has renewed her call for a complete ban on TV advertising of high-fat and high-sugar food aimed at children, in the wake of a report estimating 11,000 New Zealanders die needlessly each year through the effects of poor nutrition and lack of exercise.

The report, from the Health Ministry and Auckland University, is the first in-depth assessment of the health effects of poor nutrition. It recommended a number of measures that Ms Kedgley, the Green Health and Safe Food spokesperson has championed, including a ban on advertising high-fat and high-sugar food, particularly to children.

"Advertisers know the importance of influencing young minds and that's why they saturate television with messages aimed at the most susceptible consumers - our kids.

"We believe that a ban on high fat, high sugar food ads would be a first step towards improving the nation's health, but it has to be complimented with a properly-funded nutritional education campaign aimed at all age-groups to encourage people to eat more fruit and vegetables."

Ms Kedgley will announce on Monday the three finalists in each of the 12 categories ("Salty Supreme", "Full o' Fat", "Best Breakfast" etc) in the New Zealand Children's Food Awards.
