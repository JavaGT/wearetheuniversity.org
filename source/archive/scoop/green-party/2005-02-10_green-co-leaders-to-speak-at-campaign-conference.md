Green Co-Leaders to speak at Campaign Conference

Green Co-Leaders Rod Donald and Jeanette Fitzsimons will be highlighting election year challenges in speeches at an open session of the Party's Campaign Conference in Auckland this weekend (11 - 14 Feb).

The media is also invited to 'mix and mingle' with the Green Party's 2005 candidates at an informal lunch prior to the speeches.

The Campaign Conference will include two and a half days of training for candidates and campaign managers and one day for the initial ranking of the Greens' Party List.

The list ranking process will begin with the candidates presenting themselves to the Party's electorate delegates. The delegates, along with the Party's Leadership Group (the Co-Leaders, Co-Conveners and Policy Co-Conveners) and the candidates themselves will then have two weeks to vote for the Initial List. This is then provided as a guide to the full Party membership when they vote in an STV election in a few weeks time. Selection of electorate candidates is already well under way around the country.

Green Party Campaign Manager Dr Russel Norman said, "The Greens' preparations for this year's election are far more advanced than they were at the equivalent time prior to the 2002 vote and we are confident of presenting a strong team of candidates backed by well-prepared local campaign teams".

Of the 45 candidates currently approved to stand in the election, 19 are female; four are Maori; seven are gay; 38 have tertiary level education; 22 have joined the Party since 2000, and their ages range from 29 to early sixties.

The Greens' AGM and full Conference will be held in Christchurch at Queens Birthday Weekend, 4-6 June.

When: Lunch with the candidates 1pm, Co-Leaders' speeches 2pm, this Sunday, 13 February

Where: Whai Ora Marae, 14a Otara Road, Otara, Auckland
