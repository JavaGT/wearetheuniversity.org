Do-it-yourself detectives reveal 'secret' spray ingredients

Revelations of the "secret" ingredients of painted apple moth insecticide Foray 48B have brought a new call from Green MP Sue Kedgley for an urgent Government-funded independent inquiry into the health effects of the spray.

Painted apple moth spray campaigners, Meriel Watts and Hana Blackmore pieced together the ingredients of the spray being used up till February this year, from papers supplied by the Ministry of Health under the Official Information Act.

"One ingredient in this toxic cocktail is propylene glycol," said Sue Kedgley, the Green health spokesperson. "This has been associated with depression of the central nervous system, particularly in children.

"Propylene glycol is more commonly found in antifreeze, in brake and hydraulic fluids and as a solvent. No wonder MAF has been so obsessive in keeping the spray formula secret."

"It is frankly scandalous that people have had to turn themselves into detectives to find out information that the public has a right to know."

Earlier this month a study by University of Auckland researchers found that West Auckland residents inside the spray zone have suffered significantly increased stomach and airway problems after spraying.

"We now have proof of what West Aucklanders have been saying for months: the PAM spray contains chemicals that are potentially injurious to your health and that have never been tested for their interaction.

"If a government insists on blanket-spraying a large section of its population, it must accept responsibility for fully researching, monitoring and treating the health effects.

"It is essential that the Government finally accepts responsibility for the outrage its bureaucrats have perpetrated on the people of Auckland. Its first act should be to institute an independent inquiry into the health effects of the spray.

"Its second act should be to support right-to-know legislation that I am drafting for presentation as a private member's bill, so that this sort of situation never arises again."
