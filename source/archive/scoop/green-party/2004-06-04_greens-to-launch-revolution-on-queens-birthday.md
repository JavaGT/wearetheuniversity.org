Media Advisory Greens to launch revolution on Queen's Birthday

The Green Party will be launching a revolution this Monday, Queen's Birthday, not to replace our head of state but to change the world - one bite at a time.

Join the Food Revolution is the name a new campaign to be launched by Green MP Sue Kedgley this Monday. The Food Revolution aims to encourage New Zealanders to insist on our right to know what's in the food we eat and where it comes from. and to change aspects of our food supply.

It also aims to make changes to our food supply so that all food sold in New Zealand is SAFE - Sustainably produced, Accurately labelled, Free of drugs, disease and contamination and Ethically marketed.

Polls show that New Zealanders care passionately about food and that the overwhelming majority want proper GE labelling, an end to animal cruelty in rearing food and other changes. However, our government - while presenting itself as open and democratic - continues to deny consumers the basic democratic right to know what is in our food and where it comes from.

Two significant aspects of the Food Revolution will be a call to ban the routine feeding of antibiotics to healthy animals and a demand for mandatory Country of Origin Labelling on imported food.

The campaign launch will feature: \* The introduction of the Food Consumers Bill of Rights; \* Postcards and e-cards to be posted back to the Prime Minister, the Food Safety Minister and Food Standards Australia New Zealand; \* A comprehensive web-based and multimedia information service; \* Visual displays of common foods that can contain chemicals and toxins that are currently unlabelled - but ought to be.

Join the Food Revolution 9am, Monday June 7 (Queen's Birthday) Green Party AGM Victoria University Union Hall Wellington
