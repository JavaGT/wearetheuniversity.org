**Paula, Peter and Peter: a perplexing predicament**

Minister for Social Development, Paula Bennett, is confused about which Peter Saunders she appointed as an advisor to the Welfare Working Group (WWG), the Green Party revealed today.

“The tale of Paula, Peter and Peter is a perplexing predicament for the Minister. There are two Peter Saunders who work on welfare issues and it seems Ms Bennett is unsure of which one she appointed” said Catherine Delahunty Green Party Work and Income Spokesperson.

Ms Bennett told the house last Thursday that the WWG advisor wrote a book called Welfare to Work in Practice.

However, this book was not written by the Peter Saunders Ms Bennett appointed.

Ms Delahunty said, “The Peter Saunders who wrote Welfare to Work is interested in poverty and inequality. The Peter Saunders she appointed believes that there is a link between ‘low average intelligence and low class position’.”

“The differences are great between Peter Saunders, of the University of New South Wales, and the Peter Saunders, who describes himself as a Freelance consultant and independent author.

“One wants to reduce poverty and inequality, the other wants to increase poverty and inequality. I am not sure which one she thinks she appointed as an advisor to the Welfare Working Group but I am guessing it is the freelance Peter Saunders,” Ms Delahunty said.

Ms Delahunty pointed out there were two possible explanations for Ms Bennett’s claims.

“Either she appointed the wrong Peter, or she appointed the Peter she meant to appoint, but is deeply confused about his world view.

“How can Ms Bennett be meeting John Key’s high expectations of Ministers if she is confused about the advisors she appoints,” Ms Delahunty said.
