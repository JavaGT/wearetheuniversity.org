Green Budget Package far reaching
=================================

**Thursday, 15 June 2000, 3:20 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green Party Co-Leaders Jeanette Fitzsimons and Rod Donald today said they were pleased to announce the Greens' Budget Package - a series of measures totalling $15 million.

The list of the initiatives included in the Green Party Budget package is on the following page. Announcements regarding the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority and complementary health therapies were made on Sunday and Wednesday this week respectively.

Ms Fitzsimons and Mr Donald described the package as 'modest' in monetary terms but said the initiatives could make a real difference. They said they were pleased with the Green Party's input into the new Government's first budget and said the party had negotiated their initiatives by working co-operatively and constructively.

The Government has allocated $15 million from contingency funding for the initiatives. All initiatives have now been agreed to by the relevant ministers and the package of measures will go before Cabinet for final approval soon.

Mr Donald and Ms Fitzsimons said they were pleased some ministers had incorporated other Green proposals in their base line budgets. Trevor Mallard, for example, adopted the Green bid for environmental programmes in schools and teachers colleges and $250,000 is provided in Vote Education for this.

Both leaders said the overall package added significant value to the Government's budget and said the initiatives were an example of MMP in action. "The Government values our support and we have a mature and mutually beneficial relationship that works.

"We are very confident that the initiatives we have negotiated will yield positive results in all of the areas," they said.

Both leaders stressed that negotiations with the government were positive and there was never any suggestion of refusing to support the Government's budget at any stage.
