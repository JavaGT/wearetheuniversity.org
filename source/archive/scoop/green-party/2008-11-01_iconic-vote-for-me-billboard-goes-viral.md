Iconic 'Vote For Me' Billboard goes viral

The iconic Green Party 'Vote for me' election campaign has gone viral and opened to the public to create their own billboards online.

Gary Reese, Green Party Campaign Manager says, “The ability to make your own ‘Vote for me’ billboard has proved to be incredibly popular, reflecting how much people loved our campaign billboards”.

By logging on to voteforus.co.nz anyone can create their own “Vote For Me” or “Vote For Us” billboard.  Just upload a photo from your computer.  The personalized billboard can then be sent from the site to friends by email.  Those friends can enjoy your billboard, then go on to easily create their own.

The original 'Vote for me' billboards are now cemented as iconic political advertising.  They have received wide acclaim by many industry and academic professionals and have now won their first international advertising award.  However it is the amazing public feedback that has really highlighted how successful this campaign has been.

Gary Reese says, “In the first two days over 500 personal ‘Vote For Me’ billboards were made and sent around New Zealand and the world.  It’s growing faster by the minute.”

“There are some really amazing new billboards. There are loved pets, beautiful babies, unique scenery, good causes but mostly just people who love our campaign.  Anyone is encouraged to check it out and make your own billboard, its fun and easy.”
