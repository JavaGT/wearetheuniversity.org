Green-initiated organics programme launched

The Green Party is today welcoming the launch of one of its key post-election negotiated programmes - the Organic Advisory Service.

The $2.2 million three-year programme will be officially launched at Lincoln University at 6.30pm.

Green Party Organics Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says she is pleased to see her initiative get off the ground.

"It is great to see the Government get behind this sector and help it to expand and grow

"If the Government is committed to making New Zealand sustainable, then it must support the organics sector and increase the tiny percentage (0.24%) of agricultural land that is in organic production.

"This initiative is aimed at encouraging several hundred farmers to convert to organics every year by providing them with advice and assistance.

"I am confident that, in the years to come, we will see a burgeoning of organic production as producers become better informed about organics and have more examples and assistance to help them solve problems," Ms Kedgley says.

"Where would New Zealand's traditional agriculture be today if it had not received this kind of support in its early years? This is about helping to develop a sustainable and flourishing organic sector in New Zealand."

The programme is administered by Organic Aotearoa New Zealand.

ENDS
