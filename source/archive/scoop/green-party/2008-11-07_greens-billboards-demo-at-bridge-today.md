Greens Billboards Demo At Bridge Today
======================================

Greens Billboards Demo At Bridge Today

Thames Greens have decided to get the most mileage from their award winning billboards (voted best in the campaign by the media) by brandishing them at traffic heading to the Peninsula over the Kopu Bridge today.

After the last election rural Greens were highly critical of their Party billboards which were deemed too wordy for the messages to be read by drivers travelling at high speeds. The team designing the signs this year obviously took that on board and stuck to the old adage \"a picture replaces a thousand words."

  
The billboards have even been winning votes from members of rival political parties ... with one candidate from one of the majors asking if he could have one after the election ... and another from a minor party attempting a clumsy parody of the child poster. Alarmed about their copyright being assaulted, the advertising agency have lodged a complaint. The parents of the child were also unimpressed.

Post-election,, due to the popularity of the billboards, and true to their ideals, the Greens are planning to re-cycle the coveted billboards. Jeanette Fitzsimons' partner Harry Parke says, "They will probably be auctioned on Trade Me post-election to raise funds for the party:"

Harry also says that Jeanette will try to join the demonstration today on her way back home.

WHERE : At Kopu Bridge on the way to the Coromandel Peninsula

WHEN : 4PM TO 6PM ish (Jeanette is not expected before 5pm)
