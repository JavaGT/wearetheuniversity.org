Green Party Mâori Issues policy released

Green Party focus on democracy, education and justice for Mâori

  
Protecting the role of Mâori in our democracy underpins the Green Party Mâori Issues policy released today.

Other key policy platforms include better funding for tikanga Mâori education, and improving outcomes for Mâori in the legal system.

“At a time when the Mâori voice in Parliament is threatened by National for political purposes, the Green Party says we must entrench the seats, and give them the same status as the general seats,” Green Party Mâori Issues Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.

Currently Mâori representation in Parliament can be repealed by a simple majority, while for the general seats 75% is required. Metiria Turei has a members bill ready to go into the ballot that would reverse this inequity.

The Green Party would increase support for tikanga Mâori education, and would promote the teaching of te reo and tikanga Mâori in all schools.

“Education is the key to eliminating poverty, and is an investment in our future economic development.

“The changes that are expected in New Zealand population demographics over the next 20-50 years will see an overall aging population, but with a greater proportion of young Mâori. Mâori will exercise increasing authority over that time, and we need to prepare our young people for those opportunities.”

“We need to focus on building our education system now, to ensure all our children access their right to learn their tikanga and reo, for free, as enshrined in te Tiriti o Waitangi. Having to pay exorbitant tertiary fees to learn the Reo is a disgrace. ”

We would build participation at köhanga reo and kura kaupapa Mâori, and increase funding for te reo teacher training.”

The Green Party acknowledges and supports the effort within the Mâori community to develop models of Mâori justice processes.

In 2006, Mâori men made up 50% of the male prison population, while Mâori women made up 52% of the female prison population.

“The legal and prison systems fail Mâori. A new justice model that is focussed on rehabilitation and restoration for victims is desperately needed,” Metiria Turei says.

“Marae justice and a justice system based on tikanga Mâori would play a role in this new justice model.”

“Our funding of $50m for insulating all state homes and the $1billion for the Green Homes Fund will benefit whanau who are trapped in sub standard private housing or who are dependent on state homes. This is a key initiative to combat childhood illnesses, save money and keep our whanau warm and healthy.”
