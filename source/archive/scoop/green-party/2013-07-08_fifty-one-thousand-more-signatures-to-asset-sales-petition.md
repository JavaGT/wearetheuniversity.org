Asset sales petition resubmitted with over fifty one thousand additional signatures

The Keep Our Assets coalition will resubmit the citizens’ initiated referendum petition to stop asset sales with an additional fifty one thousand signatures today.

The coalition has had two months to collect 16,000 valid signatures after the initial count was deemed just short of the 308,000 valid signatures required. More than 445,000 signatures have now been collected in total to force a referendum.

“New Zealanders want the National Government’s unpopular asset sales programme stopped,” said Keep Our Assets spokesperson and official petitioner Roy Reid.

“The public’s resolve to stop the asset sales programme has not waned. If anything it has grown stronger, as shown by the large number of extra signatures collected in just eight weeks.

“People really got behind the last push to get the petition over the line to force a referendum on this issue because they see we can stop further asset sales.

“New Zealanders have seen that only a small number of Kiwis bought Mighty River Power shares and that the price slumped following the float and don’t want that repeated with our other assets.

“The Government should shelve the Meridian float until the outcome of the referendum is known.

“The asset sales programme is both unpopular and unsuccessful. It is time to stop it and give New Zealanders their say on the matter through a referendum,” said Mr Reid.

The petition will take up to two months to count. The additional 51,000 signatures will be added to the original signatures submitted for a new sample to be drawn.
