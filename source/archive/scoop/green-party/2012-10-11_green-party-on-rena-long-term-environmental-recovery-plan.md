**Green Party comment on Rena Long-term Environmental Recovery Plan**

“The Government should not take signs of environmental recovery as an excuse for its inaction to make our coastal shipping safer,” said Green Party oceans spokesperson Gareth Hughes.

“Let's not forget that it has taken thousands of volunteer hours and millions of taxpayer dollars to clean up the Rena mess.

“Over 2,000 birds were found dead, which represents an estimated tenth of the total bird deaths from the oil spill.

“It will take more time for scientists to determine the long-term environmental effects of the Rena, but given the devastating short-term effects on the environment and economy, the Government should do everything it can to avoid Rena-like accidents in the future.

“The Government has done nothing to make container ship spills, like the Rena, less likely, and is actively increasing the risk of an oil spill by encouraging oil companies to conduct deep sea oil drilling in our waters.”
