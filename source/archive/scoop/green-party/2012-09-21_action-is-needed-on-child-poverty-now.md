Action is needed on child poverty now

**Action is needed on child poverty now**

A new study that shows too many children are suffering from poverty and deprivation highlights that the Government is doing nothing to address it, Green Party children’s spokesperson Holly Walker said today.

“It’s not acceptable in a wealthy country like New Zealand that thousands of children go hungry, don’t have decent clothes to wear, and live in cold, damp homes,” Ms Walker said.

Today Otago University’s Department of Public Health released a report that found a “sizeable proportion” of New Zealand children have suffered low income and deprivation in recent years.

“Findings in the study that 16 percent of children live in poverty are not good enough. The figures for Māori 23 percent, and Pacific 29 percent are distressingly high.

“Most significantly a third of children of sole parents, and 13 percent of children overall in the study were stuck in persistent low income – not moving in and out of poverty on a daily basis as the Government argues.

“This report adds to a growing body of research that makes similar conclusions.

“We've got all the evidence we need for comprehensive policy to end child poverty. What will it take to make the National Government wake up and do something to save a whole generation of children? Or does it just not care?” said Ms Walker.

Metiria Turei’s Income Tax (Universalisation of In-work Tax Credit) Amendment Bill is due for its first reading next month and would extend the tax credits to the children of beneficiary and student families.

The Children’s Commissioner’s expert group also has recommended a universal child payment, which reaches the poorest kids, as an effective way of helping many children in poverty.

“The in-work tax credit had lifted thousands of children out of poverty but hasn’t helped the one in five children whose parents study or are on a benefit,” Ms Walker said.

“Little kids should not be dumped on the scrap heap before they’ve even had a chance at life – they need a chance to learn and grow and become productive members of society. Ignoring the problem just generates more. Research shows that children raised in poverty are likely to suffer health problems and remain poor as adults.

“The Government should at least back our bill through to select committee so these issues can be properly debated,” Ms Walker said.
