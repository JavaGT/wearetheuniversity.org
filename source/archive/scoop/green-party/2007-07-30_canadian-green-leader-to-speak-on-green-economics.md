Canadian Green leader to speak on Green Economics
=================================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green leader from Canada to speak on Green Economics Mon 30 July

Green Party MP Sue Bradford is inviting people to attend a talk by Frank de Jong, leader of the Ontario Green Party.

“Mr de Jong is a renowned leader on issues relating to Green economics. He is a strong advocate of economically driven environmental reforms, and has a great deal of practical advice to offer us, particularly as the Government’s carbon neutrality goals appear more and more aspirational,” Ms Bradford says.

What: "The Invisible Green Hand vs. the Time Famine - A Talk on Green Economics”  
When & Where:  
Monday 30 July  
5:00-6:00 pm  
Auckland University  
Clock Tower Building  
Lecture Theatre 039  
And:  
7:30 pm  
SFWU Building  
35 George Street, Kingsland  
.  
Frank will be explaining why green economics is so vital in our battle to find time to live sustainably. He will detail the important economic fundamentals needed for an effective carbon trading system, discuss the spin-offs urban sprawl has on housing affordability and outline the methods available to fund the much needed public transport that Auckland needs. As New Zealand ramps up for a carbon trading system, it is essential we get the economic foundations correct.

Biography: Throughout the 1980s, de Jong, 51, was active on the issues of nuclear weapons, Ontario's old growth forests, and Central American solidarity. In the early 90s he became involved in Green electoral politics and now argues for true cost pricing, green tax shifting, 100% renewable electricity, preventive health care, province-wide organic agriculture, an end to poverty, walkable communities linked by rail, bio-based manufacturing and total waste diversion.
