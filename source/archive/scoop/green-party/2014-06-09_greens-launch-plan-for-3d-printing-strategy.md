**Greens launch plan for 3D printing strategy**

Green Party information and technology spokesperson Gareth Hughes launched a component of the Green Party’s Smart Green Innovation package today.

The Blueprint For The Future, a digital manufacturing strategy for New Zealand, will:  
• develop a digital manufacturing strategy;  
• support and develop 3D printing;  
• educate and empower students in the use of digital manufacturing.

“This component, like the Green Party’s proposed structural timber award, is a blueprint for the future,” said Mr Hughes.

“The world is changing, we need to change with it and invest more in smart green innovation like digital manufacturing.

“We need to be investing more into smart green manufacturing and digital manufacturing technologies like 3D printing, which offer new economic opportunities.

“Other countries are investing significant and considerable attention in digital manufacturing in areas like 3D printing and New Zealand risks being left behind if we don't develop a national strategy.

“The Green Party will institute a taskforce to establish a digital manufacturing strategy for New Zealand, one part of our blueprint for a smart green economy,” said Mr Hughes.
