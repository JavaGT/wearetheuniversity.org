**  
Ask for Choice palm oil campaign handover at Parliament**

**What:** Handover of thousands of postcards to Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew from New Zealanders who want palm oil labelling

**When:** Today, 21 November 2016, 12:00pm

**Where:** Parliament forecourt

**Who:** Unmask Palm Oil campaign and Green Party Co-leader James Shaw.

Today, the 'Ask for Choice' campaign is presenting thousands of postcards to Food Safety Minister Jo Goodhew, asking her to support palm oil labelling on products. Green Party Co-leader James Shaw will be attending the handover and speaking at the event.

This presentation is ahead of Minister Goodhew’s trip for Friday’s meeting of 10 Ministers from each state, territorial and federal government of Australia and New Zealand. They will be deciding if vegetable oils, including palm oil, will be labelled specifically in the ingredients list of products. The Green Party has long supported labelling of palm oil, an issue championed by MP Mojo Mathers for the last several years.

“If this vote goes the right way, people will finally have the information they need to shop in line with their values and avoid unsustainable palm oil,” Green Party Co-leader James Shaw said today.

“I am really happy to support this campaign today. Unsustainable palm oil production is destroying precious rainforests, and contributing to climate change. Without the right information, New Zealanders can’t use their consumer power to choose.

“Thousands of New Zealanders have taken part in our campaign, and the Unmask Palm Oil campaign over the last few years, and [92 percent of New Zealanders](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/83148479/New-Zealand-zoos-ask-for-choice-on-palm-oil-labelling) support palm oil labelling.

“Friday’s vote has been a long time coming. The Minister is representing New Zealanders at this meeting and needs to vote for the labelling rules that the people have been asking for,” said Mr Shaw.
