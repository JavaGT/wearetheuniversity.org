MEDIA RELEASE

Green Party Launches Youth Campaign with Musical Backing

The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand will launch their youth policy for the election campaign on Friday 1 August, followed by the Wellington Greens' concert, headlined by the Phoenix Foundation and Little Bushman.

Member of Parliament Metiria Turei, Green Co-leader Russel Norman, and young candidates will be at the forefront of the launch.

Phoenix Foundation front man Samuel Flynn Scott says: "The Phoenix boys are very happy to be associating our selves with the Green Party. As a touring band we are very aware of our environmental impact and feel that all New Zealanders on every end of the political spectrum need to learn some hard lessons about the state of our country, ourselves included".

The Green Party's youngest candidate, Gareth Hughes, says "I'm really excited at being involved in bringing together our exciting youth policy with these inspiring musicians.

"Green policies - with a universal student allowance, a gap year proposal and a working age review - encompass what is actually best for young people, rather than just looking at what's best for big businesses," Mr Hughes says.

At 26, Hughes is the youngest electorate candidate for the Green Party, and number 11 on the Green Party list. As a young parent, worker and part-time student, Hughes credits his passion for the environment and the future generations as his motivations to run for Parliament.

The Greens hope their initiatives in the youth election campaign will inspire more young people to vote, especially those who will be experiencing their first election.

Despite it being a legal requirement for over 18s to enrol to vote, fewer than five in every hundred Kiwis aged 25 or older fail to enrol. Among New Zealanders aged between 18 and 24, one in four are not enrolled.

WHAT: The Green Party launch their youth policy and youth election campaign. Members of Parliament, young candidates and musicians will give brief speeches in support of the Greens.

WHERE: Opera House, Wellington

WHEN: Friday, 1 August 2008, from 6:30-7:30pm
