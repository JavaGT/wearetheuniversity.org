Biggest Issue Left Out of Cow Welfare Code

**Biggest Issue Left Out of Cow Welfare Code**

A new code of welfare for dairy cows that completely ignores the issue of factory-style dairy farming is a major concern, Green Party Co-Leader Dr Russel Norman said today.

The Minister of Agriculture David Carter acknowledged that the just released Dairy Cattle Code of Welfare 2010 did not cover the proposed factory farming of cows in the Mackenzie Country. The Minister is instead seeking separate advice on the matter from the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee.

“The Minister is completely out of touch what what is going on,” Dr Norman said.

“Thousands of New Zealanders have expressed their concern about the welfare of cows in proposed factory-style dairy farms in the Mackenzie Country. The public see this as a huge animal welfare issue.

“Yet the Government has squandered this opportunity to show that it is taking their concerns into account.

“New Zealand’s competitive advantage is our pastoral farming methods,” said Dr Norman.

“Factory farming of cows is cruel and likely to damage our international image.

“Cows standing on concrete for long periods can experience lameness, stiffness, agitated behaviour and weight loss.

“The fact that the Minister has issued the code without addressing the welfare implcations of cows living completely unnatural lives is bizarre,” said Dr Norman.

The 2010 Code of Welfare notes that this code will be reviewed no later than 19 February 2020.

“Given the current code which has been worked on since 2006 may not be replaced till 2020 surely it would have been a good idea to have temporarily delayed putting it out until the biggest single issue facing cows in New Zealand had been dealt with,” said Dr Norman.
