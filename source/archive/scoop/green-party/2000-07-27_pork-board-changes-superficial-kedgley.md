Pork Board 'changes' superficial - Kedgley

Green MP Sue Kedgley today welcomed the shift in attitude of the Pork Board over battery farming of pigs but said simply reducing the use of sow crates was not nearly enough.

The Pork Board today said it would reduce the use of the sow crate from 120 days to six weeks by 2015, would investigate restricting their use during that time and would consider recommending halting further investment in the cages.

Sue Kedgley said that while public pressure had led to a change in the pork industry the changes proposed by the Pork Board were superficial.

\"Fifteen years of transition is an extraordinarily long time to secure only a reduction in the use of this incredibly cruel farming practice," said Ms Kedgley. "We want the Pork Board to commit to fully phasing the sow crate out."

Ms Kedgley said consumers could force a revolution in the pork industry through voting with their wallets. "We call on the Pork Board to immediately come up with a free range label for free range meats so consumers can avoid eating battery pork."

"I would urge consumers to make a point of boycotting pork products unless they are labelled as free range or organic. This is the only way consumers can force an end to the ongoing torture of thousands of pigs in this country," she said.

"Battery farming is cruel and inhumane and the Greens consider it has no place in this country. Consumers can see a swift end to these practices if only they take the simple step of checking how their eggs, poultry and pork has been farmed.

"Today's comments from the pork board show these industry will not change of their own accord and under pressure the change is relative to the level of that pressure," said Ms Kedgley.
