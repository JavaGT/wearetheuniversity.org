Our most precious wilderness not safe from mining

The Green Party today revealed that the National Government is allowing mining companies to search for minerals on our most protected conservation land.

Information obtained by the Green Party shows that since the National Government’s back-down on mining Schedule 4 land in 2010, its minerals division has granted eight permits for prospecting or exploring on Schedule 4 land, and the Department of Conservation (DOC) has granted access arrangements to two companies. Addison Mines Limited has been granted an access arrangement by DOC to prospect in Paparoa National Park, while Newmont Waihi Gold has been granted access to three areas of Schedule 4 in the Coromandel. Schedule 4 land is our highest rated conservation land.

“The Greens are deeply concerned that mining companies have been granted permission to start looking for minerals on our most precious conservation land,” said Green Party mining spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

“Why is the Government allowing companies to prospect and explore for minerals on land that they have promised is off limits to mining?

“The Government’s decision to allow minerals exploration on Schedule 4 conservation land betrays New Zealanders’ expectations of what they marched to protect in 2010.”

In 2010, tens-of-thousands of New Zealanders marched down Queens Street in Auckland to oppose the National Government’s plans to remove 7000 ha from Schedule 4, so that mining on the land could be considered on a 'case-by-case' basis. The Government then backed down on their plans.

“The National Government appears to be prepared to re-write history and break their promises about protected land and mining. Why else would they let companies prospect for minerals on land off-limits to mining?” said Ms Delahunty.

“This is symptomatic of DOC’s new focus on partnering with business to do conservation work.

“New Zealanders love and want to protect our national parks and wild places, they don’t want to see them dug up.

“To reassure New Zealanders that our National Parks and most precious conservation land won’t ever be open for mining, the Government should stop allowing minerals prospecting and exploration there.

“I plan to introduce an amendment to the Crown Minerals legislation currently before Parliament, to prevent prospecting and exploration on Schedule 4 land,” said Ms Delahunty.
