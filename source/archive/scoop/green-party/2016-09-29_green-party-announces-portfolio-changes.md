Green Party announces portfolio changes

The Green Party is today announcing changes to its MPs’ portfolios, to accommodate the arrival of new MP Barry Coates.

Mr Coates joins the Green Parliamentary team following the resignation of Kevin Hague, and will officially start on Monday 10 October. He will take on the trade, overseas development and senior citizens portfolios, as well as commerce, consumer and internal affairs.

“Barry brings years of real-world experience to Parliament, particularly around trade and overseas aid and development,” said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw.

“We’ve been fortunate to have had Barry waiting in the wings for a while and we are thrilled to now have his skills and talent in our Green Parliamentary team.”

Also as part of the portfolio changes, James Shaw will take on the finance portfolio, while Julie Anne Genter picks up health and Auckland issues, to go alongside transport and associate finance.

“Julie Anne has real expertise in two of the biggest issues that affect Aucklanders – transport and urban planning – and over her time as an MP she’s built a strong following in the city,” said Mr Shaw.

“Julie Anne is the ideal MP to expand on the great work Kevin Hague did in health, particularly around mental health and ACC.”

Canterbury-based MP Mojo Mathers will be the new conservation spokesperson, while continuing to hold the disability issues and animal welfare portfolios.

"Mojo has years of experience in conservation, including post graduate research, and is a passionate advocate for our wild spaces. Conservation is, and always will be, one of the most important areas of work for the Green Party,” said Mr Shaw.
