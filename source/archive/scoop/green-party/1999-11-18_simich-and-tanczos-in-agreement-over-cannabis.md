Simich and Tanczos in agreement over Cannabis
=============================================

**Thursday, 18 November 1999, 4:10 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The National Party's condemnations this week of cannabis decriminalisation are in stark contrast to comments made by their Police Minister Clem Simich, the Green Party says.

Just over one year ago Mr Simich was quoted in the Waikato Times (3 Sept 1998, p.2) saying: \"It's not a question of whether it's right or wrong to use the drug but certainly there are more effective ways of dealing with the problem."

Nandor Tanczos, the Green Party Justice spokesperson, says that he is in full agreement.

"I totally support the Minister's comments. Prohibition has clearly failed to keep cannabis out of the school yard. We need a new approach. The Green Party cannabis policy focuses on promoting the drug free lifestyle as the healthiest, on reducing harm to users and on reducing abuse."

"Clem Simich has been a long time advocate of cannabis law reform. It is a shame that he is no longer able to say what he knows to be true, but has to speak only what the spin doctors tell him to."

Meanwhile Mr Simich appears to have found a new avenue to promote his views. A flyer distributed by him in Tamaki shows photos of Mr Tanczos and Green candidate Sue Bradford, and says that voters should know what they are voting for if they vote for the Greens.

He states that Mr Tanczos has been involved in various organisations for cannabis law reform "and was, for instance, co-organiser of the Waitangi Day One Love/Unity celebrations in Auckland".

Mr Tanczos said he was proud to have helped organise the One Love/Unity celebrations and so was grateful for the endorsement from Mr Simich.

Nandor Tanczos: 025 246 5235, 09 302 5255 (w) Adam Shelton, Green Party parliamentary media officer, 04 470 6723 (w), 04 383 5531 (h)
