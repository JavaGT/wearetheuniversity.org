**Treasury documents show failed charter schools plan should be dumped**

Treasury documents on the creation of charter schools are in agreement with criticism from the Ministry of Education, showing the planned schools forced upon New Zealand children by the National / ACT coalition agreement should be dumped, the Green Party said today.

“The Green Party agrees with Treasury and the Ministry of Education that New Zealand kids need registered teachers, not unqualified adults pushing private agendas,” said Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

“Rather than requiring concerned citizens to spend their summer writing submissions against the Education Amendment Bill, the Government should announce that it is withdrawing its plans.

“New Zealand kids need investment in quality public education, not the privatisation by stealth that the charter schools plan provides.

“Treasury warns of ‘performance risks for nearby state schools’ in areas where charter schools are formed, which could lead to ‘significant risks for the cohorts of students’ in these areas.

“Kiwi kids deserve a Government that truly cares about quality public education, rather than one that continues to put them, and our education system, at risk.”
