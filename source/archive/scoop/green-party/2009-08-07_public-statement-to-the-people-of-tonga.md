We acknowledge the shared cultural and historic bonds that link us together as Tagata Pasifika, People of the Pacific.

We acknowledge the strong relationship between our peoples and we honour the extent to which the New Zealand-based Tongan community has contributed to academic, cultural, artistic, spiritual and sporting life in this country.

We also acknowledge the strength and maintenance of strong Tongan cultural traditions in Tonga, here in Aotearoa and in the United States, Australia and wherever Tongans have settled.

We send your our best wishes and our respect, with loving thoughts and prayers.

Me ngā whakaaro, inoi aroha atu. Me te mātou aroha nui atu.

Metiria Turei.
