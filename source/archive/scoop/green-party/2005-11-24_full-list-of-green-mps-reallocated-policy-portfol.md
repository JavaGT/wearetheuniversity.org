Full list of Green MPs' reallocated policy portfolios

The Green Party Caucus has completed the process of reallocating its policy portfolios following the death of Rod Donald.

Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says that while it has been unfortunate to redistribute portfolios under such tragic circumstances and so soon after the post-election allocation, she is confident that each of the Green MPs concerned will do an excellent job in their new areas of responsibility.

Mr Donald's principal portfolios have been redistributed as follows:

Sue Bradford is now the Government's Spokesperson for the 'Buy Kiwi Made' program (see the simultaneous media release from her for details).

Ms Fitzsimons is now the Green Party's Finance and Revenue Spokesperson. Keith Locke is now Trade Spokesperson. Metiria Turei's responsibilities now include Superannuation and Tourism.

Nandor Tanczos takes on Electoral Reform and Commerce and Rod's recently acquired Waste portfolio, and resumes responsibility for Justice, Constitutional Issues and IT, as well as picking up Environment and Forestry from Ms Fitzsimons.
