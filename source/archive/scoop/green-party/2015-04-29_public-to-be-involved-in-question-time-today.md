Public to be involved in question time today
============================================

**Wednesday, 29 April 2015, 9:48 am**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

**Public to be involved in question time today like never before**

Today the public will have a voice in Parliament’s question time in a way they have never had before.

Following the Green Party’s #myclimatequestion campaign, the top questions as voted on by the public will be asked of the Government in question number one in Parliament today.

“Over the last few days the public have submitted hundreds of great questions which they want to hear the Government answer about climate change,” said Green Party co-leader Dr Russel Norman.

“So far over a thousand people have voted on their top question and people still have until midday today to pick their favourite.

“Voters can then tune in to Parliament’s question time at 2pm today to see if their favourite question is asked.

“We think that the age of social media provides great opportunities for the public to be more involved in asking questions of those in power and holding them to account.

“Judging from the response we’ve had, the public agree.

“From the questions submitted for #myclimatequestion it’s also clear that the public are frustrated by a Government that is leading us in the wrong direction on climate change.

“The Government needs to be accountable to the New Zealand public for their inaction on climate change.

“It is all of our future which the Government is threatening by refusing to take action to curb our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a smarter, greener economy,” said Dr Norman.

Voting is open until midday today here: [http://action.greens.org.nz/myclimatequestion-vote](http://action.greens.org.nz/myclimatequestion-vote)
