Green MP Nandor Tanczos will speak at a student protest at parliament tomorrow, Friday January 30.

Students and delegates at the annual New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) conference will protest the government's refusal to implement the Emergency Unemployment Benefit by creating a cardboard city at Parliament at 4pm.

Many students are in Wellington to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the NZUSA. Nandor will also be attending this conference.

It is Green policy to reintroduce the emergency unemployment benefit for students over the summer holidays.
