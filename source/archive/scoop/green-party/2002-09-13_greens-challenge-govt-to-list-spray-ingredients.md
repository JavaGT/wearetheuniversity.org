Greens Challenge Govt To List Spray Ingredients

Green Biosecurity Spokesperson Ian Ewen-Street today repeated his challenge for Government to list all the ingredients in the spray which will be used in West Auckland to try and eradicate the painted apple moth.

In briefing papers dated March 12 2002, MAF noted that 'the components \[of the spray\] are commercially sensitive and cannot be publicly released'.

In response to an oral question from Mr Ewen-Street on Tuesday this week (below), Biosecurity Minister Jim Sutton said that 'The exact formulation of the material \[spray\] is, I understand, subject to patent rights'.

"This is outrageous," said Mr Ewen-Street.

"The Government has decided to spray tonnes and tonnes of the pesticide Foray 48B on large areas of Auckland, yet it seems MAF and the Government would rather honour 'commercial sensitivities' than tell the people what will be sprayed on themselves, their properties and probably their water supplies.

"Spraying has been delayed in Auckland because of rain today, but from tomorrow onward the spray programme will be seriously ramped up," he said.

"The people have an absolute right to know and I challenge Jim Sutton to make available immediately the full list of what exactly will be in this spray and in what concentrations.

"Anything less, for whatever reason, is scandalous."

Painted Apple Moth--Eradication, West Auckland Ian Ewen-Street:

Will the Government now accept the public's right to know, and make public, the chemical formulation of Foray 48B - besides Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki - now that the decision has been made to expand the spraying programme and thus expose many thousands more Aucklanders to the poison?

Hon. JIM SUTTON: The exact formulation of the material is, I understand, subject to patent rights. As far as the Government is concerned, there are no secrets in this respect that we keep from the public. In fact, this same material was used in the white spotted tussock moth campaign, and the district health board has provided the Government with a report that indicates there were no significant health impacts.
