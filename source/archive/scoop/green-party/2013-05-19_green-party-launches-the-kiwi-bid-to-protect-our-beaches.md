Green Party launches the Kiwi Bid to protect our beaches

**Green Party launches the Kiwi Bid to protect our beaches**  
   
Today in Piha the Green Party launched a major campaign to stop the Government’s planned expansion of risky deep sea drilling, including offering New Zealanders the opportunity to join a counter bid to protect our oceans and beaches.   
   
On May 24th the Government begins the non-financial tender process with oil companies for new permits to conduct deep sea drilling in New Zealand waters off the west coast of the North Island and the East Coast of the South Island. The Green Party announced today it is gathering support for a Kiwi Bid to protect these areas, rather than drill them.  
   
“While the Government is giving oil companies the right to bid to exploit our environment, the Green Party plans to submit a competing bid to protect it,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.  
   
“We are inviting New Zealanders to become stakeholders in our bid, called the Kiwi Bid.  
   
“It’s a bid to protect our waters for all of us, rather than allow corporations to conduct risky deep sea drilling. A bid by Kiwis for Kiwis: The Kiwi Bid.  
   
“By submitting the Kiwi Bid, we give the Government a clear choice. Pursue risky deep sea oil drilling that profits the oil companies, or accept the bid from thousands of Kiwis who love our beaches and pristine ocean and want to protect them.  
   
“There is no guarantee of safety with deep sea drilling, so we shouldn't be doing it.  
   
“If there is a leak from a deep sea oil rig there is no easy way to stop it. The consequence for New Zealand's environment, economy and reputation would be catastrophic.  
   
"Even the industry admits there is no guarantee of safety with deep sea drilling, so we shouldn't be doing it.  
   
"The Government is putting the economic interests of the oil companies over the environmental values of the people of New Zealand.  
   
"The Government's argument of an economic boon are rubbish. There is little evidence that there would be many jobs from these deep sea rigs and they put at risk the local economies if there is a spill,” said Mrs Turei.
