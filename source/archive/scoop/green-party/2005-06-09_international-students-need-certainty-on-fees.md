International students need certainty on fees

The Greens are congratulating Waikato University for guaranteeing international students their fees won't increase for the duration of their studies and are urging the Government to direct other tertiary providers to follow suit.

The Waikato University Council announced last night that it was to reintroduce "grandparenting" for international student fees, which means that those students can be sure their fees won't rise while they're studying.

"This is a welcome acknowledgement that international students come to New Zealand with a certain budget and often cannot cope with escalating fees," Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos said.

"This decision will give international students going to Waikato certainty about how much their education here will cost them.

"Far too often, international students are forced into desperation and poverty because universities jack up their fees from one year to the next. It's great to see Waikato joining AUT and Massey in addressing this problem."

However, Nandor said the Government had to acknowledge that grandparenting was needed across all universities and polytechnics.

"It's time for the Government to direct all universities and polytechnics to introduce grandparenting. This will require some minor legislative change, but it's just plain wrong that most of our tertiary institutions to continue to hit up international students for more and more money each year to the detriment of their wellbeing."
