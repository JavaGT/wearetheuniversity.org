Govt's gold mining on conservation land proposal undermines 100% Pure brand

The Government is further tarnishing our clean, green reputation by opening up our conservation land to gold mining, said Green Party mining spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

Ms Delahunty was responding to the opening today of the National Government’s second competitive minerals tender, called New Zealand Epithermal Gold 2013. The tender for metallic minerals exploration permits is open to companies interested in 8,040 square kilometres in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato regions of the North Island including areas of the Pureora Forest Park.

“Gold mining in our conservation estate is no path to prosperity for our communities. Many jobs in the central North Island, such as agriculture and tourism, rely on our 100% Pure brand,” said Ms Delahunty.

“According to a recent Greenpeace report, 50 percent of all New Zealand jobs rely on our clean, green reputation.

“Gold mining isn’t environmentally benign, it creates toxic tailings dams. The Government has had to pay nearly $15 million to clean up the toxic tailings dump at Te Aroha.

“Gold mining on conservation land in the Waikato is like shooting the goose that lays the golden egg.

“By undermining the 100% Pure brand the Key Government is jeopardising our tourism industry and our export economy which relies on the clean, green brand.

“We need to make our 100% Pure New Zealand image real, not undermine it as the National Government is doing by opening up our conservation land to gold mining.

"The Green Party will protect our conservation land, not open it up to mining,” said Ms Delahunty.
