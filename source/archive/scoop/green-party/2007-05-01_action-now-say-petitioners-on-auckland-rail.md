Auckland Green MP Keith Locke today received a petition with over 3000 signatures of Aucklanders from every walk of life – with all of those who signed being in favour of the electrification of the Auckland rail network, and of the Government providing a clear timetable and funding to enable the necessary trains and signalling systems to be ordered.

The petition was presented to Mr Locke by Cam Pitches, spokesperson for the Campaign for Better Transport (Auckland).

“There is a pressing need for Government to show its hand on the electrification issue. Road congestion, climate change issues, and the looming public transport investment decisions by Auckland local authorities are all bringing this matter to a head,” Mr Locke says.

“To date, Government has said electrification is a matter of when, not if. To which the Greens are saying - if not now, then when ? The thousands of ordinary Aucklanders who have signed this petition are looking for a clear commitment and a timeframe,” Mr Locke says.

ENDS
