**Joyce’s meddling removes important voices on university councils**

Steven Joyce’s tinkering with the size of university councils won’t save money while it will shut out important voices, Green Party MP Gareth Hughes said today.

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce today announced changes that will decrease the number of members on university and wananga councils. The requirement that councils include student and staff representatives will also be removed under the proposed changes to governance.

“Mr Joyce’s proposal to axe staff and student representatives on university councils is an idea that should get a fail mark,” said Mr Hughes.

“The voices of staff and student representatives are vital to university councils making sound decisions.

“Our tertiary institutions are of course made up of staff and students.

“This proposal seems driven by Steven Joyce’s desire to micromanage the tertiary education sector.

“Mr Joyce seems intent on stacking the councils of our tertiary institutions with his own choices.

“To keep our universities internationally competitive we should be funding them properly not axing representatives from university councils.

“More ministerial meddling will not lead to better educational outcomes.

“A top quality tertiary education sector is a vital part of New Zealand performing well on the world stage,” Mr Hughes said.
