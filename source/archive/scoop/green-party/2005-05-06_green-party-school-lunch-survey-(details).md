Green Party School Lunch Survey (details)
=========================================

Green Party School Lunch Survey

The Green Party conducted a survey of 50 primary and secondary schools to monitor what type of foods are being sold by schools to children who buy their lunches.

The results show that while many schools do offer healthy lunches, they are also selling foods loaded with fat and sugar.

Some of those schools with poor lunch menus are participants of the Ministry of Education supported Healthy Schools Programme.

Most schools sell lunches everyday, meaning that children are able to eat unhealthy lunches everyday if they chose to, or if their parents are unable to make lunches.

School Lunches Results

98% of schools sell pies, hotdogs, ‘hotbites’ or sausage rolls. 72% sell chips – ( in five of 50 schools those were corn chips, and in one wedges). 80% of schools sell cookies / cakes / chocolate / donuts In 68% of schools the menu does not include fruit. In 24% of schools the roll or sandwich is more expensive than the pie. In 22% of schools there is no roll or sandwich on the menu. 30% have yoghurt on the menu. 16% of schools sell muesli bars. 24% list water on the menu. In 8% school lunches are only available one day a week.
