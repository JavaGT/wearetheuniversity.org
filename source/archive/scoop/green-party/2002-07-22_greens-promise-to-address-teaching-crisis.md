Greens Promise To Address Teaching Crisis

The Greens today launched their education policy, promising 3000 new teachers over the next five years, maximum class sizes of 20 students and a review of the NCEA with a delay or stop of its implementation if necessary.

Last week the Greens mailed over 50,000 teachers with a leaflet setting out the party's goals and policy on education.

"A teaching crisis has developed under this Labour Government and the Greens want teachers, parents and students to know how we plan to fix it," said Green co-leader Rod Donald.

"While the Greens firmly want to see teachers paid more, based on their qualifications and responsibilities, there are a range of other structural problems such as large class sizes, unmanageable workloads and lack of pay parity that we are committed to addressing.

"We also want to establish the first Commission of Inquiry into the education system since Tomorrow's Schools to address the raft of problems and make the right changes," he said.

Green education spokesperson Ian Ewen-Street said one of the Green Party's key concerns with the NCEA was the workload it was putting on teachers.

"We want to review the NCEA and we want to look in particular at the work pressures this is putting on teachers. If these workloads are proving unmanageable then we are prepared to delay the implementation of the NCEA until it is fixed," he said.

"We also want to improve working conditions for teachers and the quality of education for students by cutting class sizes down to 20 students per teacher."

Mr Ewen-Street and Mr Donald said the immediate Green goal was for teachers to be paid what they were worth and to have students back in classrooms.

"We don't think this is too much to ask. Our policy would deliver this and go a long way further towards ensuring a sustainable, resilient education system that will last a long way into the future."
