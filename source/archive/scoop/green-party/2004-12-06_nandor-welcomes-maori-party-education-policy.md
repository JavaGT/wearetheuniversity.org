Nandor welcomes Maori Party education policy

Green Party Tertiary Education spokesperson Nandor Tanczos today congratulated the Maori Party on its commitment to ending the burden of student debt.

“It is awesome to see yet another party recognising the crippling effects the student loan scheme is having on our people and our economy,” Nandor said.

“The Green Party believes that education should be treated as a fundamental human right. Ending the discriminatory student loan scheme is one step towards recognising that right.”

Nandor said he also hoped to see the Maori Party address the commodification of education by international trade agreements.

“Education is not a commodity and should be excluded from commercial agreements along with other cultural, land, health and social rights.

“The Maori Party has made a strong commitment to deal with the burden of debt and places high importance on national interest. We look forward to it supporting our campaigns against free trade in goods and services.”
