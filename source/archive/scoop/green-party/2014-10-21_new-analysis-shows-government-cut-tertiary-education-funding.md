New Analysis Shows Government Cut Tertiary Education Funding

**New Analysis Shows Government Cut Tertiary Education Funding**

New analysis done by the Green Party today shows the Government has made cuts to funding of tertiary education since 2008.

Figures compiled by the Parliamentary Library show that between 2009 and 2015 Government funding to Tertiary Institutions dropped by 4 percent, adjusting for inflation and increases in funded places.

“The Government is forcing students to pay higher fees because they are not adequately funding tertiary institutions,” Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Gareth Hughes said today.

“We should be increasing the affordability of tertiary education, not putting it further out of reach of many students.

“On top of their cuts to Postgraduate Student Allowances this Government is cutting overall funding and making it harder for New Zealanders to study at a tertiary level by ramping up fees even higher.

“High fees are a barrier to participation and lead to years of debt for many students.

“Tertiary Education is both a public good and a way to address New Zealand’s low labour force productivity.

“High fees load too much of the cost on students who can’t afford them.

“The Government shouldn’t be shifting more of the cost of Tertiary Education onto students in an attempt to get into surplus,” said Mr Hughes.
