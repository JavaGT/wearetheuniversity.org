EEZ Act fix must not weaken environmental protections

**EEZ Act fix must not weaken environmental protections**

The Government must ensure the public that changes to the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Act 2012 will not weaken environmental protections and make it easier for mining applications to be approved, the Green Party said today.

The Government today announced emergency changes to the EEZ Act, which it says is to fix a technical loophole.

“The fact is this legislation has only been in effect for two years and has already been amended once, and now the Government needs emergency legislation to fix it,” said Green Party energy spokesperson Gareth Hughes

“This is an embarrassing botch-up.

“In his comments in the House today Nick Smith did not rule out changes being made to the Act to suit the seabed mining industry.”

Following EPA decisions rejecting two seabed mining applications, Chatham Rock Phosphate managing director Chris Castle said last week in the Otago Daily Times that he had met with ‘key Ministers’ and that _'_Changes will be made soon; the wheels are already turning ... Then it's going to get easier'.

“Any changes to this legislation must not weaken environmental protections to make things easier for the mining industry,” said Mr Hughes.
