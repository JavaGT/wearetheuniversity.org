**Green Party statement on passing of FCV legislation**

The Green Party congratulates all parties in Parliament for supporting the completion of the Foreign Chartered Vessel legislation.

Legislation passed today ensuring the end of a shameful era of human rights abuses under successive governments and several fishing companies.

“Human rights and proper monitoring of our fisheries should have been the norm but sadly it has taken a ministerial inquiry and years of struggle to get to where we are today,” Green Party fisheries spokesperson Steffan Browning said today.

“This legislation deals with a stain on New Zealand’s international reputation regarding working conditions.

“We hope that New Zealand contributes to eliminating the abuse of fishers and crew throughout the Pacific and beyond,” Mr Browning said.

The Green Party also congratulates the investigative journalists, human rights groups, churches, unions, academics and individuals that exposed the abuses occurring on foreign chartered vessels.
