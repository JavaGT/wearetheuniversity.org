Urgent action needed on aspartame, Greens say

The Greens are calling on the Government to urgently review current regulations governing the use of aspartame, following the release of a new three year study linking regular use of the sweetener with increased incidence of leukaemia, lymphoma and breast cancer in animals.

"Considering how widely aspartame is used and consumed by young children as well as adults, an urgent review is essential," says Green Party Safe Food Spokesperson Sue Kedgley.

"In the meantime, it's imperative that consumers are made aware of these findings, and of the significant number of adverse side effects that can be caused by aspartame in warning labels on food and drink products that contain the additive.

"The new study, published this month in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, also reported that when exposure to the sweetener starts during fetal life, the potential carcinogenic effects are increased. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Authority are planning to review this new evidence, and New Zealand must follow this lead," Ms Kedgley says.

"This is the second comprehensive study by the Ramazzini Foundation to show a link between carcinogenic illness and relatively low levels of aspartame, levels approaching the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans.

"Aspartame is one of the most common - and controversial - food additives in our food supply and it's potential adverse effects were highlighted recently by the case of Wellington woman Abby Cormack who thought she was dying after experiencing a range of severe side effects after consuming high amounts of chewing gum containing aspartame.

"Instead of just putting their head in the sand over this issue, it's time our regulators put the health of consumers ahead of the profits of the food industry," Ms Kedgley says..

Another concerning finding of the study is that when exposure to aspartame begins during foetal life, its carcinogenic effects are increased.

"This increases the need for warning labels to consumers, and in particular pregnant women.

"Aspartame is found in approximately 5000 food products, including diet drinks, chewing gum and many other products. The fact that thousands of children are consuming these products shows the need for urgent action," Ms Kedgley says.
