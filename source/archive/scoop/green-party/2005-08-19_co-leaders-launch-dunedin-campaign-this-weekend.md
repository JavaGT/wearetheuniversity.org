Greens Co-Leaders launch Dunedin campaign this weekend

The Dunedin Green Party's 2005 election campaign will be officially launched this weekend, with the arrival of both of the Party Co-Leaders over the next four days.

Rod Donald arrives today to campaign with the local Green team, and Jeanette Fitzsimons arrives on Monday for two days in Dunedin.

In addition to a number of speaking engagements, Mr Donald will be launching the campaign by canvassing with the Party's two Dunedin candidates - Philippa Jamieson and Peter Thomlinson - this afternoon.

Ms Fitzsimons will be meeting with a number of groups on Monday and Tuesday. She will also be delivering a key speech in the national campaign on Monday night in Dunedin, on the Greens' plan to prepare for the end of cheap oil. This speech will be at a public meeting being held at 7.30pm in Archway 3, University of Otago Campus, Cnr of Union St East & Leith Walk.

"Our campaign for the party vote in Dunedin will be focusing on our key messages of a cleaner environment, a fairer society, safe, sustainable energy and healthier food and people", said Ms Jamieson, the Greens' Dunedin North candidate.

"Another important aspect to the campaign will be educating voters about the MMP system and how they need to think carefully about their two votes. If voters want a Labour-led government with a strong support partner in the Greens, then they need to party vote for the Green Party this election," said Mr Thomlinson, the Greens' Dunedin South candidate.
