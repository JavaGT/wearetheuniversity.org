Stricter Controls Still Leave Wild Salmon At Risk
=================================================

**Wednesday, 23 February 2000, 1:37 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The Green Party said today that stricter controls on a genetically  
engineered salmon experiment have failed to provide the wild salmon  
population with enough of a safety net.

"The stricter controls imposed by the Environmental Risk Management  
Authority (ERMA) on the research by NZ King Salmon have brought the  
containment standards up to the level required under the Hazardous  
Substances and New Organisms Act, and of course I see that as an  
improvement," said Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons.

"But there is an important point everyone is missing - this research near  
Blenheim is of no use unless it can lead to commercial growing of salmon in  
sea cages, and salmon in sea cages escape," she said. "While there are few  
New Zealand studies about this, one overseas study has found that a quarter  
of all \`wild' salmon from one river in Norway came from salmon farms.

"I challenge King Salmon to declare that none of its non-genetically  
engineered sea-caged salmon in the Marlborough Sounds have escaped. It  
would contradict what we have been told by local fishermen, company staff  
and by Conservation Department officers."

In a recent study by Purdue University (Indiana, United States) researchers  
found that a 0.1 per cent intrusion of transgenic fish into a wild stock  
could bring that population to extinction within 40 generations where the  
gene reduces the offspring's ability to survive. They have dubbed this  
decimation theory the "Trojan gene hypothesis", on the grounds that the gene  
gets into the population looking like something good but ends up destroying  
the population.\*

"Uncontrollable incidents such as a hole being torn in the mesh or more  
importantly in respect to King Salmon's Kaituna Hatchery near Blenheim -  
flooding - could also potentially result in eggs escaping from research  
tanks into the wild. To date there has been little monitoring of conditions  
set by ERMA and we have seen nothing to reassure us that the integrity of  
the new screens will be regularly checked."

Nelson-based King Salmon conceded last year that a small percentage of the  
genetically engineered fish had been spawned with large, bumpy heads at its  
Blenheim research facility.
