Commonsense prevails with Wellington hospital
=============================================

**Thursday, 30 September 1999, 4:58 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green Party Health spokesperson and Wellington Central list candidate Sue  
Kedgley says commonsense has prevailed in the Government's decision to keep  
Wellington's major tertiary hospital in Newtown.

"It makes far better sense to have a hospital in the heart of a city, where  
most Wellingtonians can reach it easily, than in an outer suburban area of  
the city," she said.

"It also makes sense to locate it near to an already existing infrastructure  
of health care services. The cost of having to relocate these facilities  
would have been prohibitive, and would have made no sense at all," she said.

"The decision is good news for Wellington city, and especially for Newtown,  
which would have suffered a huge dislocation if the hospital and surrounding  
businesses had been forced to move away from it."

The Greens also welcomed the decision to upgrade facilities at Keneperu.

"This decision will meet many of the concerns of residents from Porirua and  
surrounding areas," Ms Kedgley said.
