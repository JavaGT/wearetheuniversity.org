**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Battle Of Oamaru Confirmed  
2pm Saturday 7 October Victory Park  
(near Whitestone Historic Precinct)

Official Declaration of War  
1pm TODAY on the steps of Parliament

Keith Locke, Nandor Tanczos and Rod Donald, the leaders of the Green Republicans, will receive a “Declaration of War” from Lieutenant Carl Layton and his Loyal supporters on the steps of parliament at 1pm today. The Declaration is attached.

The three Green MPs will respond by leading a band of 50 fellow republicans into non violent battle with Alf’s Imperial Army in Oamaru this Saturday at 2pm.

The event is all in a good cause. The MPs are lending their support to the Whitestone Civic Trust and the Victorian Town at Work initiative to help promote historic Oamaru as a living museum.

“Each town or region has its own unique tourist attractions,” said Green Party Co-Leader and Tourism spokesperson Rod Donald. “Oamaru is blessed with not only the Whitestone and Red Shed area but also two penguin colonies, an art gallery, a museum and a Sunday market, to name but a few local attractions. Come and join us for a fun filled weekend”.
