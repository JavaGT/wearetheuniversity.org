No more excuses – climate action starts today  

  
The Paris Climate Agreement coming into force is a triumph for ordinary people around New Zealand and the world who have demanded politicians take action to stop climate change, the Green Party said today.

The Paris Climate Agreement will come into force today after crossing the threshold of at least 55 countries, responsible for 55 percent of global emissions, joining the agreement.

“Around the world there’s a real desire for action on climate change, and I think we’ve seen that shift here in New Zealand," said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw.

“In the last few years thousands of New Zealanders have marched in the streets, petitioned the Government, and demanded real action on climate change.

“The National Government is slowly beginning to wake-up to the urgency, and also the opportunity, climate change presents – but now we need to see real evidence that they have a strong plan to actually reduce our emissions.

“National needs a rethink of its economic strategy to fit with the new climate reality. Carbon emissions have increased 19 percent since National took power.

“Tackling climate change represents a huge opportunity for New Zealand. It’s a chance to invest in electric public transport, build healthier, and more energy-efficient homes, and shift to more sustainable forms of agriculture," said Mr Shaw.
