Greens support Wellington rail network workers

The Green Party supports Wellington members of the Rail and Maritime Transport Union (RMTU) who are today striking to maintain hard-fought-for pay and conditions.

“The Green Party stands in solidarity with RMTU members and call on their employers to offer real wage growth and the retention of conditions,” said Green Party industrial relations spokesperson Jan Logie.

“These people work really hard to provide a high level of service to tens of thousands of passengers every day, and are often required to work long and flexible hours.

“Working people never take a decision to strike lightly, and that this is the first time there has been a major industrial action to affect the Wellington railway network since 1994 shows how important this is to them.

“Transdev are proposing a clawing back of basic conditions and pay commitments that they signed up to when they took on the contract only a year ago.

“Cost savings shouldn’t come out of the pockets of working people, and contract tenders should protect existing conditions.

“It’s unacceptable that the rights and conditions of the people providing our public transport are being attacked to increase the profits of multinational companies,” said Ms Logie.
