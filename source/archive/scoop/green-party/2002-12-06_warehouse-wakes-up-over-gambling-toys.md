Warehouse wakes up over gambling toys

Green Gambling Spokesperson Sue Bradford today welcomed a decision by The Warehouse to stop selling pokie machine toys, saying the move was socially responsible and commonsense.

"These toys which imitated adult pokie machines were designed for children as young as three. I am pleased that once the devastating impact of pokie machines on New Zealand families was pointed out to The Warehouse, the decision was made to remove them from the shelves," said Ms Bradford.

"Despite earlier comments from a Warehouse spokesperson about political correctness gone mad, the eventual decision recognises that pokie machines are very addictive and cause so much misery to many thousands of New Zealand families.

"The very last thing we want is to be socialising our children to pokie machines and normalising gambling through these insidious toys. I am glad that The Warehouse now agrees."
