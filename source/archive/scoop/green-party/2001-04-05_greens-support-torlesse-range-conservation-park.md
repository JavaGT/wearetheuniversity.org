Greens Support Torlesse Range Conservation Park

Greens Support Conservation Park For Torlesse Range

Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today said the Greens would strongly support a proposal to create a conservation park in Canterbury's Torlesse Range.

Ms Fitzsimons said creating the high country park would help protect the remarkable flora and fauna in the area as well as scenic values and public access to outstanding open space for recreation.

"This is the first of what I hope will be a chain of protected areas in the South Island high country.

"It has been made possible by the tenure review process under the Crown Pastoral Lands Act which provides for leases with significant conservation value to be returned to the Crown while areas suitable for farming can be sold to the lessee," said Ms Fitzsimons.
