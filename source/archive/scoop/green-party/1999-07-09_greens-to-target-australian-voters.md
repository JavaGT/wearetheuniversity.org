Greens to target Australian voters
==================================

**Friday, 9 July 1999, 6:31 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

9 July 1999

Green Party Co-convenor Christine Dann will be in Australia from July 12 - 26 to network with Australian Green Party members and to target New Zealand voters who live down under.

Ms Dann will also be presenting a paper on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority at the AgriFood Research Network Conference at Sydney University.

"Two per cent of the 18 million people in Australia are Kiwi and most of them are under 30," said Christine Dann. "This is a key group the Green Party will be targeting in the coming election and we will be encouraging them to use their special votes to vote Green," she said.

"There is a significant block of New Zealand voters living in Australia which could make a difference to the outcome of the election," she said.

During her trip Christine Dann will be meeting with Australian Greens to discuss an amendment to the ANZFA Act. The amendment, which has been through the Australian House and will go to the Senate in September, will seriously weaken consumer protection from the likes of genetically engineered food, she said.

"This is Australian legislation which, because of ANZFA, will affect all New Zealanders," she said. "I will be investigating how New Zealanders can become involved in this process and how we can make submissions on this crucial amendment."
