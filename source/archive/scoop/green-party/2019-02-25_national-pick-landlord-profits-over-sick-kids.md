National would rather save landlords some cash than look after sick kids: Green Party

The National Party is more concerned about the back pocket of property investors than sick kids and the elderly, Green Party Co-leader Marama Davidson said today.

“In Aotearoa thousands of kids and the elderly are being admitted into hospital with respiratory diseases linked to mould and damp in their rental property.

“If landlords can only justify an investment by leasing out a property that makes New Zealanders sick, then they shouldn’t be in the business.

“Most landlords are doing the right thing and are happy to invest the money in their properties to make it warm and dry.

  
“For Judith Collins to champion the plight of a minority of landlords who don’t want to spend the money making their investment property safe beggars belief.

“I am so proud this Government and the Green Party is prioritising the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders over a cluster of landlords who don’t want to fit critical insulation that makes a home dry, warm and safe.

“We will continue to implement policy that prioritises the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders”.
