Green art auction grows

Over 90 artworks will now feature in "The Great Art Auction" to be held in Christchurch on Sunday 12 December.

The event has been organised by the Banks Peninsula Green Party as an election campaign fundraiser.

Notable artists include Bill Hammond, Neil Dawson, Bing Dawe and Tony de Lautour. Altogether 60 artists have submitted work for auction, including several graduating fine arts students from Canterbury.

"We thought that holding an auction might be a good idea after two supportive artists offered to donate an artwork each to help with my next campaign," said Green MP Rod Donald. "But I never expected it would grow into the major event that it has become.

"Our website [http://www.thegreatartauction.org.nz](http://www.thegreatartauction.org.nz) is attracting a lot of interest, with 69 artworks from 55 artists already available for viewing," he said.

While a number of works have been donated, including three artist's proofs from Bill Hammond, most of the art is being auctioned on commission.

"It's great to be able to support the artistic community, especially the young graduates who have submitted work that is well worth collecting.

"The Great Hall of the Arts Centre is a fitting venue and with 'this is your life' Bob Parker as MC and professional auctioneer Bryan Andrews taking the bids it will certainly be 'the great art auction'!" he said.

The artworks go on show from 2pm with free viewing and a silent auction until 5pm. The doors reopen at 6pm for live entertainment and refreshments and the live auction commences at 7pm.

Evening entry is by ticket only - door sales $10, pre-sales $8 (available from the Arts Centre Information Centre or the Green Room, 16 Bedford Row).
