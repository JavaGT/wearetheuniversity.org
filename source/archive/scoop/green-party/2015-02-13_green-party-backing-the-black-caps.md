Green Party backing the Black Caps  

The Green Party is sending its very best wishes to the Black Caps as they begin their quest to win the ICC Cricket World Cup tomorrow.

“To win the World Cup on home turf would be an amazing achievement for the Black Caps and our country. With Brendon and the boys playing as well as they have been, we’re in with a real shot,” said Green Party MP (and cricket fanatic) Kevin Hague.

“We have had some fantastic New Zealand cricket teams over the years, but this particular batch of Black Caps seem to have something special about them. They play the game hard but fair and they represent our country admirably.”

With millions watching the tournament on TV around the globe and thousands of fans flying into New Zealand to watch their teams, the World Cup is also a great opportunity to show off our country.

“It’s an honour for us to be hosting teams and fans from around the world and to them we say, “Welcome!” We wish you the best of luck on the field (except when you’re playing us) and we hope you have a great time in our country!

“We also want to congratulate the World Cup organisers for all the hard work they’ve put in to getting us through to opening day. And to everyone who will be working at stadiums around the country over the next six weeks, we thank you in advance.

“Regardless of the outcome of this tournament, we are already so proud of the Black Caps. The next month and a half is going to be a wonderful celebration of this fantastic team and the game that many New Zealanders love.”
