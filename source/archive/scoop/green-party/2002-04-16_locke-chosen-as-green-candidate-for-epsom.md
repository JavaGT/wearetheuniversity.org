Locke Chosen As Green Candidate For Epsom Electorate

Green MP Keith Locke was last night chosen as the party's candidate for the Epsom electorate.

\"My main aim will be to double the party vote in the seat to 10 percent. This is achievable, as there a lot of Green friendly voters in the seat. In 1990 the Green Party won 13 percent of the vote in Remuera."

Mr Locke has lived in the electorate, in Mt Eden, for the last 15 years.

"I'll be focussing on stopping the Eastern Highway slashing its way through the electorate," said Mr Locke, who is the party's Associate Transport Spokesperson.

"We don't need more motorways pouring more cars into central Auckland. The money available should go to completing the rail network as a top class passenger transport system, and improving bus connections.

"Newmarket station should be humming as a hub for this passenger rail system."

Mr Locke is also against the "huge supermarket" off Broadway being planned by Westfield.

"That would only bring thousands more new cars into an already clogged Newmarket and undermine shopping along Broadway. The Newmarket retail are has great character, which we don't want to lose."

Mr Locke, who is also the Green Party Foreign Affairs spokesperson, thinks voters will be attracted by the party's peace message.

"People of Epsom follow world events closely and are proud of New Zealand's nuclear-free status. Many are not happy that we are tagging along behind America in ventures such as Afghanistan," he said.
