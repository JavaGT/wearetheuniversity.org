**Media Advisory: Public Forum on the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery this Saturday**

**What:** “A Proud and Sustainable Christchurch” – Public Forum on the earthquake recovery  
**When:** Saturday 6 November 2010, 2pm – 5pm  
**Where:** Oxford Terrace Baptist Church Lounge, 286 Oxford Terrace, Christchurch  
**Who:** Green Party MP Kennedy Graham & Labour Party MP Brendon Burns

Green Party Canterbury earthquake spokesperson, Kennedy Graham, will co-host a public forum on the earthquake recovery with Labour Party MP Brendon Burns this Saturday afternoon at the Oxford Terrace Baptist Church Lounge.

“This meeting is to give the people of Canterbury a chance to say what they want from the rebuilding of Christchurch,” said Dr Graham.

“While the central government and the city council are the main vehicles for the recovery and reconstruction effort, there is scope for a democratic input into decision-making process.”

The forum will include break out groups on how to Christchurch a sustainable city, citizen engagement, preserving heritage, and revitalising the city’s inner business district, facilitated by local politicians, academics and experts.

“Everyone is encouraged to come and exchange ideas on how we can respond to this very significant and rare event,” said Dr Graham.

“Let’s use this opportunity to work together for a recovery we can be proud of.”
