One million reasons to change the Government

Auckland’s [average house price](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11704482) hit one million dollars today, as National tried to put a band-aid on the housing crisis with rushed [new legislation](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/special-housing-legislation-be-extended) to stop Special Housing Areas falling apart, the Green Party said.

“Aucklanders wanting to buy their first home now have one million reasons to change the Government,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.

“National has shown time and time again that they’re focussed on helping their property speculator mates, not helping first home buyers.

“John Key’s legacy is a generation of young people locked out of million dollar houses in Auckland.

“The broken housing market is failing to provide affordable houses in Auckland and the National Government has refused to fix it.

“The Government needs to stand up for young families, crack down on overseas investors, put in place a capital gains tax (excluding the family home), close the tax loopholes, and build thousands of affordable houses,” said Mrs Turei.
