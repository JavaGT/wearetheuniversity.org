Nandor rolls up his sleeves for E-Day

Green MP Nandor Tanczos is getting his hands dirty tomorrow by volunteering for E-Day 2007 collecting used computers and mobile phones for reuse or recycling.

He will be joining the Waikato 2020 Communications Trust between 11.30 am and 3.30pm tomorrow.

"Most computers when they reach their end of life are simply dumped in landfills without any of the recyclable components being removed," Nandor says.

"This is a double whammy. Not only does it mean that new resources have to be mined for the new replacement machine, but landfills are also bearing the weight of this extra and sometimes hazardous waste.

"Some component materials are being rapidly depleted such as the metal hafnium, increasingly important in computer chips, which could be gone by 2017 according to some experts.

"If not recycled from old computers this valuable metal will just end up buried in landfills," Nandor says.
