United Future urged to support Green microchip amendment

  
United Future should take heed of the 8000 signature petition it will receive today from Federated Farmers Waikato requesting that the law requiring the microchipping of dogs be repealed, Green Party Musterer Metiria Turei says.

"I hope United Future really listens to the petitioners and supports the Green Party amendment to remove the microchipping requirement for all dogs except those already identified as menacing and dangerous. This is an opportunity for the Greens and United Future to work together for the betterment of the whole community. It should not be about political point-scoring.

"United Future have been advocating a limited repeal for farm dogs only, but farmers have made clear today that they want everyone in the community enjoy the same reprieve. Federated Farmers understand that there is no reason why urban and provincial people should be discriminated against when it comes to their dogs," Mrs Turei says.

United Future will have the opportunity to support the Green Party amendment during the committee stages of the debate on the Local Government Law Reform Bill today.

"I sincerely hope that United Future will support our amendment, especially in light of this petition. To borrow some United Future terminology, our amendment represents the most common sense response to the microchipping issue, and it would be great to see all parties recognise this," Mrs Turei says.
