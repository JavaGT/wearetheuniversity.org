**Christchurch Ministry needs sustainability focus**

The new Christchurch Ministry needs to have a focus on sustainability from the start, said the Green Party today.

“It is vital that the people with expertise in sustainability and urban design are involved in the rebuilding of Christchurch from the outset,” said Kennedy Graham, Green Party Spokesperson for the Christchurch Earthquake Recovery.

“Christchurch can be a model of a green city that delivers prosperity and protects the environment. The city can be designed to reflect 21st century values and technology.

“The rebuild needs to be based on the principles of sustainable urban design for buildings, transport and green spaces.

“We also need to future proof our city from future challenges and build in resilience to earthquakes, rising oil prices and environmental hazards.

“The Ministry also needs to listen to the people of Christchurch. It is their lives, homes and city that have been shattered.

“The people of Christchurch need to be represented in the Ministry. This is only fair and it will help keep the agency locally attuned.

“Given the extensive powers that this body could have under the Canterbury Earthquake Response and Recovery Act, it needs to have cross-party parliamentary oversight,” said Dr Graham.

The Green Party is planning to host public meetings to discuss how best to sustainably rebuild Christchurch. Details will be announced shortly.
