Cannabis In Schools Mirrors Community Problems
==============================================

**Thursday, 25 January 2001, 2:57 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green Party MP Nandor Tanczos today said he agreed with the president of the Secondary School Principals Association Tom Robson, that the resourcing of schools to properly deal with cannabis use among students was crucial.

"What is happening in schools around this country is similar to what is happening in our communities. Schools are unable to deal with students who need assistance for cannabis-related problems because they are under resourced, so students are simply being suspended without the underlying issues being addressed.

"Likewise drug services in the wider community are also seriously lacking and people are unable to seek the help they need for cannabis-related problems - either because these services do not exist or because they are scared of being arrested," said Mr Tanczos.

"I was pleased to hear Mr Robson say this morning that if the schools were resourced properly to deal with a range of social issues - including drug issues - facing a small number of students, his association probably wouldn't be making too much noise about cannabis decriminalisation.

"This is a realistic position and shows a willingness on the part of the Secondary School Principals Association to help students with their problems instead of punishing them.

Mr Tanczos said there was no question that suspending and criminalising students was greatly exacerbating any harm caused by cannabis use and that it was time for a more realistic approach.
