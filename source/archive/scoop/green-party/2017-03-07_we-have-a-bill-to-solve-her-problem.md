We have a Bill to solve her problem

Paula Bennett’s first speech as Minister for Women was underwhelming and will not change things for New Zealand women, the Green Party said today.

New research released today by the Ministry for Women, and promoted by the Minister, shows about 80 per cent of the gender pay gap is due to ‘unexplained’ factors.

“For Paula Bennett’s first speech as Minister of Women, it would have been great for her to announce what her Government will actually do to ensure that women get paid more,” Green Party women’s spokesperson Jan Logie said.

“My next members’ bill, to be introduced in the ballot tomorrow, will see gender pay transparency indexes published. If Paula Bennett is serious about wanting more companies to pay women more, then she can support my bill immediately.

“For her to say she agrees with research is one thing, but women in New Zealand need the Government to take action. This is just more hot air from a Government that specialises in paying lip service to voters.

“New Zealand’s lowest paid workers, through their unions, have been calling for action for years now.

“If Paula Bennett is serious about the gender pay gap being one of her top priorities as Minister, then she needs to take bold, meaningful action.

“We’ve tried the hands-off approach of just encouraging businesses, but it hasn’t worked.

“18 months on from going into pay negotiations with aged care workers like Kristine Bartlett, the Government is still yet to make a pay offer.  
“Paula Bennett needs to make a serious pay negotiation offer to Kristine Bartlett and aged care workers so that tens of thousands of women can be paid better.

“We can fix the gender pay imbalance in this country and ensure that every woman is paid what she’s worth, but we need a real commitment from the Government to make it happen,” Ms Logie said.
