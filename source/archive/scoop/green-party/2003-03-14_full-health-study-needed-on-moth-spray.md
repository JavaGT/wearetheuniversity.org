Full health study needed on moth spray
======================================

Full health study needed on moth spray

Green Party Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley is calling for an urgent Government-funded independent inquiry into the full health effects of the painted apple moth insecticide Foray 48B.

Ms Kedgley's call follows the release today of a study suggesting links between human health problems and the Auckland moth spray campaign.

The study by Dr Keith Petrie, Elizabeth Broadbent and Mark Thomas from the University of Auckland has found that west Auckland residents inside the spray zone have suffered significantly increased stomach and airway problems after spraying.

The study is based on people's perceptions of their illness, rather than medically diagnosed conditions. The researchers said that while there were adverse health effects linked to the spraying, more time was needed to establish a direct link with the aerial programme.

Ms Kedgley said the researchers should be immediately funded by the Government to conduct a fuller study.

"If a Government insists on blanket-spraying a large section of its population, it must accept responsibility for fully researching, monitoring and treating the health effects.

"The Government can't keep turning its back on the large number of people suffering health problems from the spray."

Ms Kedgley repeated Green Party calls for the full list of ingredients in Foray 48B to be made public, to help people get proper medical advice.
