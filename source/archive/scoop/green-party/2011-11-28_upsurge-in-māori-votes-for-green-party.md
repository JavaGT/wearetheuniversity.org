**Upsurge in Māori votes for Green Party**  
  
Māori communities’ support for the Green Party has more than doubled between the 2008 and 2011 general elections.

Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said the surge in votes for the Greens from Māori was heartening.

“Each of the seven Māori electorates has rewarded us with a significant increase in votes. It shows our vision for Aotearoa is in line with the wants and needs of tangata whenua.”

The Green Party’s main policy priorities include raising 100,000 tamariki out of poverty in three years, restoring the mauri of all awa in Aotearoa and building a smart green economy to create jobs at all skill levels and protect the environment.

The party also advocates for a halt on deep sea oil drilling, fracking and the sale of state-owned assets.

The Green Party received 10.7 percent of the nationwide Party Vote, increasing its MPs in Parliament from nine to 13. The new MPs include Denise Roche who is of Ngāti Raukawa and Ngāti Huri decent.

In the Māori electorate Te Tai Tonga, candidate Dora Langsbury (Ngai Tahu, Ngāti Mamoe) secured 15 percent of the candidate vote up from 10 percent at the 2008 election and 15.5 percent of the party vote up from 7percent. In Te Tai Hauāuru, the Greens party vote tripled from 3.5percent in 2008 to 11 percent. Eighteen-year-old candidate Jack McDonald (Taranaki Iwi, Te Whakatōhea) received 11.2 percent of the candidate vote.

A founding principal of the Green Party is respect for and adherence to Te Tiriti O Waitangi.
