Corporal Punishment not a Private Matter

The Green Party is concerned by the findings of a Law Commission report  
which suggests private schools are unchallenged over use of corporal  
punishment.

"It seems bizarre that private schools can be considered above the law  
of the land, especially when they get $40 million of state funding a  
year and are expected to meet modern standards in all other ways," Green  
Party Education Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.

"It is even more illogical - given the changes to section 59 of the  
Crimes Act - that any school would be able to act inconsistently with  
the ban on corporal punishment."

Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey Palmer's foreword to the Private  
Schools And The Law report shows private schools inhabit a grey area  
legally and regulation has never had systematic attention.

More than 30,000 students attend New Zealand's 99 private schools and  
they deserve the full protection of the law, Ms Delahunty said.

Non violence needed to be upheld in all homes and all schools and  
regulations protecting all children applied across the board: "Private  
schools can teach from their own philosophical perspective but we  
believe the Ministry of Education has a duty to ensure all schools  
receiving any level of state funding are safe and free from violence  
against children."
