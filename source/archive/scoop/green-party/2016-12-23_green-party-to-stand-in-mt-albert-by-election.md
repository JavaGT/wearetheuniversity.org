Green Party to stand in Mt Albert by-election

The Green Party will be standing a candidate in the 2017 Mt Albert by-election.

“2017 will be the year New Zealanders opt for a positive and progressive government. The Mt Albert by-election is the start of that,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

“Aucklanders want MPs in Wellington who know the frustration of not being able to buy a house, of not earning enough to put food on the table and pay the rent, or of sitting in endless traffic jams.

“Most of all, they want MPs who’ll stand up for them and help make their lives better with positive, affordable solutions to the issues that matter.

“Aucklanders aren’t getting that from Bill English’s government and they’re hungry for change.

“If selected, Labour has a very strong likely candidate in Jacinda Ardern and she will be the favourite to win. However that’s not a reason for us, or any other party, to not field a candidate.

“The people of Mt Albert deserve to hear more than just one view on the issues they care about – that is their democratic right.

“It was weak of Bill English to opt out of running a National Party candidate in Mt Albert. He’s denied thousands of Aucklanders the chance to engage with the government on whether they’re ever going to fix the city’s traffic-clogged roads, or finally put first-time homebuyers before property speculators.

“The Green Party can’t wait to hit the streets and have these debates and discussions with the people of Mt Albert,” said Mrs Turei.

The Green Party will select its candidate early in the New Year.

“We will select a talented, credible and dynamic candidate, who will be an excellent voice in Parliament for the people of Mt Albert,” said Mrs Turei.
