Death of Sir Hugh Kawharu a loss to all New Zealand

The death on Monday of Sir Hugh Kawharu was a great loss to Ngati Whatua, to Maoridom as a whole and to all of New Zealand," Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says.

"Sir Hugh's journey from his birth in Ashburton to his brilliant university studies at Auckland, Cambridge and Oxford universities marked only the beginnings of an illustrious career.

"He later headed the Anthropology departments at Massey and Auckland universities, and served with outstanding distinction on the Maori Council, the Royal Commission of the Courts, and the Waitangi Tribunal, as well as within various United Nations organisations.

"By skill, integrity and quiet example, Sir Hugh became renowned as a masterful bridge builder. His wisdom and guidance will be missed by all New Zealanders, as the meaning of bi-culturalism continues to evolve in this country."
