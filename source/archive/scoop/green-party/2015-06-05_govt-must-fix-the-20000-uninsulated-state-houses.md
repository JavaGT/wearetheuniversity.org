Govt must fix the 20,000 uninsulated state houses

**Negligent Govt must fix the 20,000 state houses that remain uninsulated**

The Green Party is calling for the Government to immediately insulate and fix the 30 percent of state homes that it has neglected to insulate so far, despite promising to do so.

“Every New Zealand child deserves to live in a warm, healthy home. We cannot have another case like Emma-Lita Bourne – it’s an absolute disgrace that this is happening in 21st century New Zealand,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

“We know this Government has been a negligent landlord.

“It’s been almost a year since [the Green Party revealed](https://home.greens.org.nz/press-releases/national-breaks-promise-insulate-every-state-house) that the Government had broken its promise to insulate every state home and that 20,356 of HNZ’s 68,386 properties remained uninsulated.

“That’s 20,000 cold, grotty, damp homes that Kiwi families are spending this winter living in.

“Nick Smith says that those homes can’t practicably be insulated or heated. What a load of rubbish.

“Housing New Zealand could put thermal drapes and floor coverings in all of its homes.

“The house that Emma-Lita lived in had no wall insulation, no thermal curtains and no carpets.

“Thermal curtains and decent carpet would have made her family’s home warmer and dryer, and helped keep the family, including Emma-Lita, safe, warm and well.

“The National Government has failed to properly insulate state houses. The reason why is because it has been saving money by running the houses into the ground.

“As this country’s biggest landlord, the Government is responsible for the welfare of hundreds of thousands tenants.

“It can’t continue to shirk responsibility for these tenants’ welfare – the results are too tragic,” said Mrs Turei.
