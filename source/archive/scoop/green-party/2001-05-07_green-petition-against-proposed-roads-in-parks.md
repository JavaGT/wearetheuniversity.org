Green Petition Against Proposed Roads In Parks

Green Petition Against Proposed Roads In National Parks

The Green Party Executive today approved a petition seeking to stop proposed roads between Golden Bay and Karamea and South Westland and Otago.

The two roads would travel through two national parks and Green Party co-convenor, and petition holder, Richard Davies said the party was opposing their building on three key reasons.

"These roads are not economically viable, they will be bad for the environment and, quite simply, they are not wanted," he said.

Mr Davies said the two roads would seriously compromise some of New Zealand's most outstanding conservation drawcards - the Heaphy and Hollyford tracks.

Mr Davies will officially launch the petition on Tuesday 15 May at the Golden Bay end of the Heaphy Track. He will then do the 3 ½ day tramp to the other end.
