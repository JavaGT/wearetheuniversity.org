Govt’s cost cutting hits NZ kids learning

The Government has taken Treasury’s bad advice and increased class sizes despite knowing that this policy will negatively affect children, Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.

Class sizes are set to increase and teachers will come under tough performance scrutiny, in education changes announced this morning by Education Minister Hekia Parata.

“Increasing class sizes will have a negative effect on the quality of teaching in our schools and impact on already under pressure teachers,’” said Ms Delahunty.

“This will hit struggling kids the worst - research shows that class size matters most to those who struggle most.

“This policy has nothing whatsoever to do with improving educational outcomes. It is purely aimed at cutting costs and ultimately teacher numbers.

"The money the Government wants to spend on teacher appraisal, including possible performance pay, would be much better spent maintaining smaller classes.”

Ms Delahunty pointed out that research conducted by Michael Boozer and Tim Maloney, ironically for Treasury itself, based on the Christchurch Health and Development Study finds statistically and economically significant positive effects of children being assigned to persistently smaller classes.

Other policy changes announced by the Government include the requirement for teachers to have a minimum post-graduate qualification.

“While the Green Party supports post graduate qualifications the Government’s recent tertiary education tweaks are a barrier to this policy succeeding,” said Ms Delahunty.
