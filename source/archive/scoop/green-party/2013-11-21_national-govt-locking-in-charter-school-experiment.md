National Govt locking in charter school experiment

The Government is trying to lock in an untested education experiment with charter schools before its trial is even complete, the Green Party said today.

The Minister of Education has just announced she is opening a second application round for charter schools.

“The Government is barrelling ahead with its charter school agenda when it hasn’t even seen how its trial has gone,” Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.

“The Ministry of Education has already raised serious concerns about the first five charter schools before they have even opened doors to students. There is no reason to try and lock in more of these bad schools,” said Mrs Turei.

“The international experience is clear; charter schools don’t work for students.

“It’s time to cancel this disastrous and wasteful experiment, not extend it.

“The Green Party is giving charter school applicants fair notice that when in Government we will close charter schools and focus on what is actually effective for our kids; investment in great public schools and great public education.

“New Zealand kids all deserve to have a good future laid out before them and charter schools won’t provide that. A really strong public education system can.”
