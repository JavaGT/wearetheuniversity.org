Green Party selects Jo Wrigley as candidate for Hamilton West

The Kirikiriroa-Hamilton branch of the Green Party of Aotearoa has selected Jo Wrigley as the Hamilton West candidate for the 2017 general election.

“I’m excited to be standing in Hamilton West. As a community-based advocate for low-income families I have real-life insight into the struggles of people living in Hamilton,” Jo Wrigley said. “I’m keen to take that advocacy to Wellington.”

Ms Wrigley said house prices in Hamilton West had escalated out of proportion to family income and while affordable housing was important it was just as important to ensure that rental homes were warm, secure and affordable too.

“Rising rent takes a big toll on family budgets and, along with rising prices for other essentials, has a disproportionate effect on low income households. There are many families struggling to maintain a roof over their heads and good food on their tables,” she said.

Living costs for low-spending households rose more than twice as much as for high-spending households last year, according to Statistics NZ’s Household Living Costs Price Index data.

“The rewards for working hard are not being shared fairly,” Ms Wrigley said.

Ms Wrigley is also advocating for swimmable rivers. Last year she stood as the Greens candidate for the Waikato Regional Council and is deeply concerned that the Healthy Rivers Plan has a timeframe of 80 years for a relatively small improvement in water quality.

An active member of communities based in Kirikiriroa, Ms Wrigley is a Trustee of Te Whare o Te Ata/Fairfield Community House, runs a beneficiary and low income advocacy service with People’s Power Community Advocacy & Education and is a past trustee of Young Workers Resource Centre.

Ms Wrigley is the mum of four children, married to wife Ree, and lives in Fairfield with their youngest child in a home with a rambling fruit and vegetable garden, one cat and free ranging chickens.

“It’s time for a Government with heart,” she said. “A strong, Green Government will ensure families and the environment thrives.”
