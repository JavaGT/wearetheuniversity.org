Dolphins in danger need human help

The Green Party is urging the community to make submissions on the Doubtful Sound Dolphin Threat Management Plan before the submission process on the threat management plan closes tomorrow, September 5. The management plan provides options for protection measures to ensure both the survival of the remaining 56 animals, and their restoration to more viable numbers.

"The human impacts on these dolphins are varied. Researchers at Otago University claim the bottlenose dolphin population in the fiord could be extinct within 30 years because of pressure from tourism," Greens Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.

"Other questions have been raised about the impact of excess fresh, colder water from the Lake Manapouri power station on their habitat, feeding habits and the survival of the calves. This may be exacerbated if Meridian should seek and win consent to increase the amount of fresh water released into Doubtful Sound, especially if this happens before full research into the impact of water temperature changes is carried out.

"Both commercial and recreational boating could also be adversely affecting the dolphins. The management plan needs to consider the threats posed by all the human activities on this population, with the priority being to ensure the highest level of protection for this species. That can only happen if there are a wide variety of submissions from the community in the Sounds, and from around the country.

"The survival of these dolphins depends on everyone taking responsibility for the threats these creatures face, and that includes lending support to all the measures essential to ensuring that human activity does not drive the dolphins to extinction," Ms Turei says.
