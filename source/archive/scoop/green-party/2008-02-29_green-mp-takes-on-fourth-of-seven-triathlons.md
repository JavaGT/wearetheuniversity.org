Green MP takes on fourth of seven triathlons, Hamilton

Green Party MP Metiria Turei is this weekend to tackle the fourth leg of her gruelling schedule of completing seven triathlons and one half marathon this summer.

This Sunday, Mrs Turei will take part in the MoreFM Triwoman triathlon starting at Waikato University.

"I'm really looking forward to being part of an event with women who are willing to step outside of their comfort zone.

"My primary goal is not to drown and, that achieved, then to finish. As long as I am somewhere in the bottom third, I will be delighted," Mrs Turei says.

Mrs Turei will also be wearing a Green-branded outfit, to prove that no only to the Greens talk the talk, but they also walk the walk, swim the swim and bike the bike.

What: Metiria Turei tackles the MoreFM Triwoman Triathlon  
When: 10.30am, Sunday, 2 March 2008  
Where: leaving from Waikato University, Hamilton
