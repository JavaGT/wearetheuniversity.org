Interim Decision Means Supersized Schools
=========================================

**Interim Decision Means Supersized Schools**

The Government needs to take note of the concerns of Christchurch parents who do not want their schools supersized, Green Party associate education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said today.

Education Minister Hekia Parata this afternoon announced that four Christchurch schools will close to form a super-school. Aranui High School, Aranui Primary, Wainoni and Avondale will be closed to form one facility catering for Year 1 to Year 13 students.  One school proposed to merge, Chisnallwood Intermediate, will stay open.

“Bigger schools do not mean better schools,” said Ms Delahunty.

“The vast majority of the feedback to the Government has been that parents, children and their community do not want the Government to push through mergers and mega-schools.

“Communities still reeling from the trauma of the Christchurch earthquakes now have to deal with more upheaval and change with proposed school mergers set for 2017. 

“It is great news that Chisnallwood will be allowed to remain open and it is better that children, their parents and school communities have a decent amount of time to plan for the mergers.

“There is a suspicion though that the Government is using Christchurch communities to experiment with supersizing schools and that this policy could move beyond Christchurch.

“Christchurch families have suffered from years of trauma caused by the earthquakes.  These families should not be put through any more stress through badly managed school closures,” Ms Delahunty said.
