Gollum at risk of extinction in the Nevis River

**Gollum at risk of extinction in the Nevis River**  
  
While everyone is worrying about _The Hobbit_, a unique, rare, and threatened native fish species called Gollum is at risk of extinction in the Nevis River in Central Otago, the Green Party said today.

“A unique species of _Gollum galaxiid_ – named because of its resemblance to J.R.R Tolkein’s famous character – lives in the Nevis River and is found nowhere else in the world,” Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman said.

“A Special Tribunal ruled in August that the Nevis River should be protected from ever being dammed in order to save the Nevis Gollum from extinction, but Pioneer Energy has appealed this decision and wants to dam the River.

“The Special Tribunal report is very clear that damming the Nevis River would put Gollum at risk of permanent extinction.

“While everyone is trying to save _The Hobbit_, the Minister of Conservation has the opportunity to step in and help save Gollum,” Dr Norman said.

Dr Norman said that the Department of Conservation had a legal responsibility to preserve all indigenous freshwater fisheries and freshwater fish habitats, and should be obliged to act to protect Gollum.

“When I questioned the Minister of Conservation in the House today, she said DOC was yet to decide whether to join the appeal to protect the Nevis River.

“The optimum time for DOC to make a submission is in the next few weeks, and the Department has a clear responsibility to act to protect this threatened native fish species.

“The particular Gollum that lives in the Nevis is found nowhere else in the world, has outstanding natural value, and would not survive if the river was dammed.

“DOC’s own Chief Executive Al Morrison said in a recent speech ‘when ecosystems are degraded and species destroyed, the country’s prosperity is imperilled’.

“It is our unique and precious natural environment that makes New Zealand such an attractive destination for filmmakers. In the long run, protecting native fish like Gollum and rivers like the Nevis from destruction is as vital to our economy as retaining _The Hobbit_,” Dr Norman said.
