Greens to march in Hikoi on Maori representation in Auckland

The Green Party is calling on the Government to ensure that Maori are represented in the new Auckland Super-City.

The following Green Party MPs will march in the hikoi - Russel Norman, Metiria Turei, Sue Bradford, Sue Kedgley, Catherine Delahunty and Keith Locke.

"Maori have the right to have a say in the new Auckland Super-city. It is completely unacceptable that the Government is ignoring the Royal Commission's recommendation that Maori and mana whenua groups are represented in the new council structure, said Green Party Maori Affairs spokesperson Metiria Turei said.

"The Green Party will work with iwi and Maori community groups to fight for Maori representation in Auckland."
