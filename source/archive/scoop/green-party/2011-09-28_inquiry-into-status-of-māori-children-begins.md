**Inquiry into status of Māori children begins**

The terms of reference for the Māori Affairs select committee inquiry into the status and wellbeing of Māori Children were today confirmed.

The committee agreed to hold the inquiry in June of this year, but had not confirmed either the terms of reference or the opening date for submissions.

Submissions are now open for the inquiry

The Aotearoa Equality Group congratulates the Māori Affairs committee for its commitment to the inquiry.

The Aotearoa Equality Group, convened by Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei and Rāhui Katene Māori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga, and also involving Labour MP Louisa Wall, have been promoting this inquiry.

“We are very pleased that by working together across political boundaries the Aotearoa Equality Group has supported the Māori Affairs Select Committee to hold this crucial inquiry,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei. “We urge everyone in the community, whānau, marae, teachers, academics, health workers, indeed everyone, to make a submission.”

“We also want to thank Every Child Counts and Te Kahui Mana Ririki for supporting the Group and promoting this inquiry, “said Mrs Turei.

“Tiakina nga rangatahi, nga rangatira mo apopo. We must care well for our children and young people for they are our leaders of tomorrow. This inquiry will ensure our mokopuna are protected, valued and nurtured as the core of our whanau. The Māori Party is proud to be a joint partner in such an important forum,” said Rāhui Katene.

“This Maori Affairs inquiry provides an opportunity for the investigation into the State’s role in contributing to the development of our precious children. The Labour Party is concerned about the growing inequalities in our country, and the distribution of public resources needs to ensure all of our children have the best start in life so they can take full advantage of our world class education system and become fully productive citizens of Aotearoa,” said Labour MP Louisa Wall.

The terms of reference for the Māori Affairs select committee inquiry into the status and wellbeing of Māori Children are attached. Submissions on the inquiry are now open to the public. There is guidance on making a submission on the Parliament website.

The Aotearoa Equality Group is a cross party parliamentary group which works on policies that will create a more equal society. The group is affiliated to the Equality Trust and meets regularly at Parliament.
