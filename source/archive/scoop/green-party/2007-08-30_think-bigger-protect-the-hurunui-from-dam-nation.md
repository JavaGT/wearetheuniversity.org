Think bigger, protect the Hurunui from dam-nation

The Green Party is welcoming a proposal that hopes to protect the rugged Hurunui River from development.

Fish & Game and the New Zealand Recreational Canoeing Association today lodged an application with the Environment Minister for a Water Conservation Order on the upper Hurunui River and lakes. The Greens understand that the Department of Conservation and Ngai Tahu also support the application.

"The Environment Court defence of the Buller Water Conservation Order earlier this month shows the importance of these orders in protecting waterways with significant biodiversity and recreational values," Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.

A Water Conservation Order is one of the tools available under the Resource Management Act to protect significant waterways from developments that would impact on their wild values so much appreciated by the public.

"It would be a crying shame to see such a rugged and scenic valley drowned for a new think-big hydro or irrigation development, like the Central Plains Water scheme further south. The Greens hope that a Water Conservation Order will help protect the river from such large-scale projects, while still allowing current irrigation takes in the lower river," Mrs Turei says.

In 2002, Hurunui Irrigation and Power Trust proposed a dam on the Hurunui River that would form a 15-kilometre-long storage lake for an irrigation and hydro scheme. Such a dam would alter forever the wild value of the river.

"The Hurunui is a very significant river in North Canterbury, and an area much appreciated by the public for its conservation value and recreational uses, including fishing and picnicking.

"Upstream of the plains the valley landscape is quite stunning and rugged, with scenic lakes and wild gorges.

Following and outcry from environmental groups, including the Greens, the Environment Court ruled that it was inappropriate to alter the Buller Conservation Order in order to permit a hydro development on the wild Gowan River flowing from Nelson Lakes National Park.

The Greens call upon the Government to look favourably on this application to protect the natural values of the upper Hurunui for future generations.
