**Animal welfare groups urge MPs to vote for Green Bill**

Parliament has an opportunity to debate the institutionalised suffering of animals for the first time in a decade, and do something positive about it, Green Party animal welfare spokesperson Sue Kedgley said today.

Today Ms Kedgley launched the Animal Welfare Amendment Bill with the support of all New Zealand’s major animal welfare organisations. Ms Kedgley’s bill ensures that practices which breach key sections of the Animal Welfare Act must be phased out.

“I am delighted that the key animal welfare organisations have got in behind my bill,” said Ms Kedgley.

“SAFE, WSPA, and the SPCA are all supporting my bill, as is Mike King who helped put the plight of sow crates firmly in the public spotlight.

“These groups are appealing to MPs to vote with their conscience and help end the suffering of thousands of animals in New Zealand.”

Ms Kedgley said the Labour Party, United Future and the Maori Party have all pledged support for the bill, and she was hoping that ACT and National would support it as well.

“There is overwhelming support amongst ordinary New Zealanders for strengthening our animal welfare legislation and ending the cruel treatment of animals,” said Ms Kedgley

“People have seen the footage on television of sows locked up in their cages chewing the bars of their cages, in utter frustration.

“And they cannot understand why Parliament allows this to happen.

“MPs know that animals suffer when they are kept in cages for prolonged periods of time.

“Now they have a chance to do something about it,” Ms Kedgley said.

“My bill will be a test of whether animals, or vested interests, are more important in our Parliament.”
