Do you take your tea with human rights?

When Helen Clark sits down for talks with the second-most important Chinese politician tomorrow, she should serve him Tibetan tea and have a chat about human rights.

Mr Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress and second only to Chinese President Hu Jintao, is arriving in New Zealand this evening for a four-day visit.

"Helen Clark, who has been a human rights champion throughout her career, must speak her mind when she holds talks with top Chinese politicians," Green Co-Leader Rod Donald said. "That's why I'm urging her to raise the grave concerns Kiwis have about the Chinese Government's human rights record with Mr Wu Bangguo.

"The Chinese Government imprisons its political enemies, condones child labour, carries out the vast majority of the world's executions, and oppresses the people of Tibet," Mr Donald said. "The Prime Minister should be raising these human rights issues with Mr Wu Bangguo, and serving him some lovely Tibetan tea would be an appropriate accompaniment.

"Last year, China executed at least 3,400 people, or about 90 percent of the world's total. Thousands of its own citizens languish in prisons and forced labour camps, for no greater crime than promoting democracy or holding religious or political views that differ from those of China's government. The media is not allowed to criticise the government, and the internet is tightly controlled.

"Too many countries shy away from challenging China on human rights because it is an economic powerhouse. Our government, no matter how keen for a free-trade agreement with China, must take a more principled position."

China has an appalling record on labour standards, refusing to sign core International Labour Organisation conventions and to abolish forced labour, Mr Donald said.

"China operates prison labour camps believed to house seven million inmates, who are forced to work up to 16 hours a day, without health or safety protections or adequate food, producing a variety of products for export.

"Some of these slave-made products would receive preferential trade access to the New Zealand market were the Government to sign the free-trade agreement with China it's pursuing. That's why the Prime Minister must include a discussion of human rights issues in these talks with Mr Wu Bangguo, and make clear that New Zealand won't even start negotiations on a free-trade agreement until core ILO conventions are ratified.

"We can't be seen to turn a blind eye to the Chinese Government's human rights abuses at the same time as trying to do business with them," said Mr Donald.
