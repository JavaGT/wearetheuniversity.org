Kennedy Graham Green Party's Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson

Christchurch resident and MP Kennedy Graham will be the Green Party's spokesperson for earthquake recovery.

"Like many other MPs, I'm helping with the immediate emergency response right now," said Dr Graham who has been going door-to-door this week in badly-affected suburbs such as New Brighton, Parklands and Dallington.

"Over time, we'll look to work constructively with the Government on the broader issues around rebuilding Christchurch.

"We'll need to discuss how we pay for infrastructure, how we re-make a modern, safe and environmentally-friendly city, and we also need to make sure the people of Christchurch have their say in the project.

  
"But for right now, the focus remains on helping the many thousands of residents still in serious need of basics such as food and water."
