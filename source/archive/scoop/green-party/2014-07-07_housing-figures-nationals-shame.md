**Housing figures National’s shame**

The number of Auckland households in urgent and serious need of housing has increased tenfold since March 2012, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.

The Ministry of Social Development, which took over Housing New Zealand’s assessment responsibility for social housing in April, said there were 3,188 Priority A households ‘at risk’ that include a significant and persistent need that must be addressed immediately.

There were another 2,652 households with ‘serious housing need’, “where the household is unable to access and/or sustain suitable adequate and affordable alternative housing”. The national number of A and B households in urgent and serious need has risen 11 percent since March.

“In March, 2012, the number of ‘at risk’ Auckland households was 160, today it is 1,707. The numbers with serious need have soared to 1,632 from 921,” Mrs Turei said.

“These figures are a shame on the Government.

“All New Zealanders deserve secure housing, whether renting or owning,” Mrs Turei said.

“Today’s housing figures are the result of this Government’s policies that have left one in four of our children in poverty and where the well after have been looked after but not those most in need.

“We believe central and local government should take the lead in building more affordable housing. We will build more state houses and fund third parties to provide affordable housing.

“Under our Progressive Ownership initiative, home ownership will be put in reach for tens of thousands of families with children, through a rent-to-buy scheme.

“Our Home for Life policy will strengthen tenants’ rights and will limit rent increases. For Housing NZ tenants, we will cap rents at 25 percent of income.

“We will curb house inflation by introducing a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) and limit non-residents from buying our houses,” Mrs Turei said.
