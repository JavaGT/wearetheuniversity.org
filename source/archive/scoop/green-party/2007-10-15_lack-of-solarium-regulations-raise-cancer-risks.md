Lack of solarium regulations raise cancer risks

Lack of solarium regulations raise cancer risks

Green MP and Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley is calling for a legally enforceable standard to govern the use of solariums, including a prohibition on their use by people under 18, amid growing international concerns that they significantly increase the risk of melanoma.

Ms Kedgley's call follows confirmation by the Minister of Health, in response to a written question, that there are no legally enforceable standards governing the use of solariums in New Zealand.

A study by the World Health Organisation shows that people using sunbeds before the age of 35 raise their risk of developing melanoma by 75 percent. The World Health Organisation recommends that people under 18 should not use sunbeds because of their greatly increased risk of developing cancer.

\"Belgium, France and Sweden have legislation limiting the maximum proportion of UV-B exposure, and France has also prohibited sunbed use for under 18 year olds, Ms Kedgley said. "The Australian Medical Association recently called for a ban on under 18's using sunbeds, amongst other regulations. Both the South Australian and Victorian Governments look likely to act on this recommendation."

"But in New Zealand anyone can pay to get a tan, and children as young as 15 are being exposed to very strong ultra violet rays. There is a voluntary standard, but two Consumer's Institute surveys of solariums have found that only a tiny percentage of providers complied with this voluntary standard.

"Given that the level of UV rays that people are exposed to on a sunbed is up to five times stronger than the midday summer sun, this is totally unacceptable," Ms Kedgley said.

New Zealand and Australia have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. "If we are serious about reducing our huge melanoma risk, we must introduce a legally enforceable standard governing the use of solaria, Ms Kedgley said.

Ms Kedgley says an education campaign is also needed, particularly targeted at young people, to warn them of the health risks of solarium use." There is a perception that solariums provide a safe way of getting a tan-- despite the fact that research shows solarium use increases the incidence of melanoma, cataracts and premature ageing in people who use them."
