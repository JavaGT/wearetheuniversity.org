**Ministry must foster local innovation in education, rather than importing failure**

The Government should be supporting innovation from within the public education system to improve overall student outcomes, rather than importing failed ideas from overseas, the Green Party said today.

“If Ministry of Education Chief Executive Lesley Longstone truly thinks New Zealand’s education system is not world-class, she should start looking locally at proven solutions,” said Green Party spokesperson for education Catherine Delahunty.

“Instead of importing failed ideas from overseas like performance pay and charter schools, we should be expanding programmes like Te Kotahitanga, which has resulted in huge improvements for students at NCEA level.

“New Zealand educators are consistently innovative but support from the Ministry has been lacking for proven success stories, like restorative justice programs to address bullying.

“The Government has an opportunity to centrally fund school support staff, such as those working with disabled students, rather than leaving it to schools to play them off against other expenses.

“Education Minister Hekia Parata must listen to the leadership of New Zealand’s innovative teachers, not failed ideas brought over from England by Mrs Longstone.”
