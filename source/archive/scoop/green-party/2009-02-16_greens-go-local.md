Greens go local - media release

For the first time in Waitakere City, the Green Party is running a candidate under its own banner in local body elections. Former Community Board member, Registered nurse and Chair of Ranui Community House, Karen Perri, is standing for election in the Massey Community Board by-election as a Green Party candidate. Voting papers will be delivered starting Monday 16th February and must be returned by noon on Wednesday 11th March.

\"I'm really happy to stand as a Green Party candidate, because there's so much that we can do locally - here in Massey - to make our world a better place, now and in the future," says Karen Perri, Green Party candidate. "Our streets urgently need to be made safer and friendlier to both people and businesses. Any commuter knows that our transport network needs urgent improvement. Let's get buses, trains and ferries working properly. We need to foster more community gardens and encourage housing people can afford to live in. Above all, let's look at the local economy. Local businesses, jobs and households are hurting, but I see so much potential. There's just so much we can - and must - do together."

“My work in Ranui has shown me that the more we join together as small communities and work with each other for the common good, the better quality of life we can all enjoy,” says Karen Perri, Green Party candidate. “If I’m elected to the Massey Community Board I’ll work to make our streets safer for our children and all of us, to improve bus, train and ferry services and to foster more community gardens. I see local jobs and affordable housing as major areas for improvement. And I’ll support current projects which are good for people and our environment, such as Project Twin Streams, Sustainable Ranui and Massey Matters.”

“Green politics isn’t just about what happens in Parliament,” says Green Party Spokesperson for West Auckland, Kath Dewar. “It’s always been about working as part of our local communities to improve everyone’s quality of life. We have highly effective Green Party councillors in many areas of New Zealand. Waitakere Eco-City has thousands of people who vote Green in general elections and thousands more who want the chance to have a Green voice in their local authority. People like to know the views of the person they vote for and by voting for a Green Party candidate Massey residents can be certain they’ll get a representative who’ll speak out for everyday people.”
