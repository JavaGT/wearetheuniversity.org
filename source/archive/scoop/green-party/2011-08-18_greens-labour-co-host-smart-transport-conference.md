"New Zealanders want and need smart green transport investment," said Green Party transport spokesperson Gareth Hughes.

"The Government continues to waste billions on new motorways, but there are transport alternatives that deliver healthier and more vibrant communities and cheaper, easier and greener ways of getting around.

"We invited the Minister of Transport Steven Joyce, or other representatives from the National party, to attend the conference, but unfortunately they declined, I think because they don't want to hear that their motorway plans aren't smart.

"Smarter transport will be better for our economy and create more jobs and it is also better for our environment," said Mr Hughes.

"Out of the approximately 3 billion dollars that this Government has allocated to transport projects across New Zealand, only 0.7% goes into public transport infrastructure. For a country that prides itself on being at the forefront of global innovation and conservation, this is simply unacceptable," said Labour list MP based in Auckland Central, Jacinda Ardern.

"Public transportation in New Zealand has long been neglected and it's important that we start looking at ways in which we can build smarter transport networks in order to boost economic competitiveness and productivity.

"It's time that the Government realised that investing into smarter transport solutions could have some positive long-term effects. Not only are we investing in infrastructure which will make our cities more liveable, we're also preserving New Zealand's environment and living up to our clean, green image" said Ms Ardern.
