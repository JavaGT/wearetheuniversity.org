Another town, another highway

The Green Party today warned communities along the path of John Key' s election schedule to cancel all appointments with the would-be Prime  
Minister or risk having a multi-lane highway fast-tracked through their town.

"John Key seems to think all the world's problems can be solved by fast-tracking the building of a multi-lane road," Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says.

"First stop, the Waikato ($750 million), now Tauranga ($100 million). If Key announced his schedule, towns would at least have a chance to cancel all appointments with him before he announces a new motorway through their community.

"I strongly recommend to the quiet communities of Eastbourne, Takaka and Opotiki that they check their diary's for the next few days and cancel any appointments they might have with Key, before they find their parks and backyards have been inadvertently volunteered for a massive new highway.
