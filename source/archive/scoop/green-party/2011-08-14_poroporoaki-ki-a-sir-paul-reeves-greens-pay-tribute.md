Poroporoaki ki a Sir Paul Reeves: Greens pay tribute

The Green Party today pays respect to Sir Paul Reeves, the first Maori Governor General and former Archbishop of the Anglican Church.

“It was with great sadness that we learnt of Sir Paul Reeves’ passing this morning,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

“Sir Paul broke through many barriers to achieve what he did in his life, particularly because he lived through a period of overt racism in New Zealand.

“Perhaps as a result, he was always a staunch advocate for those living in poverty and for peace and justice.

“In recent years he did great work to advance the Treaty Settlement process for his people.

“We will always be grateful for his advocacy and compassion,” Mrs Turei said.

As well as being Governor General from 1985-1990, Sir Paul Reeves had been chairman of the Nelson Mandela Trust and chairman of the Fiji Constitution Review Commission. Most recently he was chancellor of the Auckland University of Technology.

“We extend our deepest sympathy to his whanau and join the nation in mourning his death,” Mrs Turei said.
