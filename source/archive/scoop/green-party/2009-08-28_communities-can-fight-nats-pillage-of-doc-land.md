Communities can fight National’s pillage of DOC land

The Green Party is calling on communities to defend their local heritage sites from pillage by mining companies.

Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee this week called for the most precious and significant land in New Zealand’s public conservation estate to be opened up for mining.

Because of a 1998 Green Party amendment to the Crown Minerals Act, the Government will have to consult with the public before it allows mining companies into the places listed in the Act as no-go for mining, which includes national parks, marine reserves, precious wetlands and internationally-recognised World Heritage Areas.

“The New Zealand public has an opportunity to fight the destruction of our National Parks and other national treasures. Kiwi’s who care about our environment can tell the National Party that they will not stand for mining in our most special places,” said Green Party Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei.

The Government is trying to justify mining in heritage sites on the grounds of economic development, but this completely ignores the economic and environmental benefits that the public conservation estate provides. It also ignores the vital importance of New Zealand’s clean green image to our economy, said Mrs Turei.

From 2004-2007, the public conservation estate returned some $22.5 billion to the economy. That return comes in many forms including flood protection ([Whangamarino Wetland – $5million](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0705/S00050.htm)); water services ( [Te Papanui Conservation Park –$136million](http://www.doc.govt.nz/publications/conservation/threats-and-impacts/benefits-of-conservation/the-value-of-conservation/the-value-of-water-in-the-te-papanui-catchment/)); tourism ventures ( [Fiordland National Park – $196 million](http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/benefits-of-conservation/economic-impacts-fiordland.pdf)); and marine conservation ( [Otago Peninsula – at least $35 million pa](http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:155044/WP144.pdf)).

“The public conservation estate also makes a massive contribution as a carbon sink and will have a huge economic value in future climate agreements”, said Mrs Turei. “In addition of course to being a vital asset in the fight against climate change.”

Some of the national treasures under threat from this proposal are: the Coromandel, Paparoa National Park, Kahurangi National Park, Aspiring National Park, Waituna Lagoon and the Awarua Wetlands.

“These are some of the most beautiful places in our country. To allow mining in them is beyond an outrage, we need to protect them for our children and future generations,” said Mrs Turei.
