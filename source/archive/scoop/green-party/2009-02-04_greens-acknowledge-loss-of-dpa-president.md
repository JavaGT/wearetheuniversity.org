Greens acknowledge loss of DPA President

The Green Party is saddened to hear of the sudden death of Disabled Persons Assembly President Eamon Daly.

"He devoted his life to fighting for the rights of people living with impairments and was dedicated to ensuring disabled people are treated with respect," Green Party Disability Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty said.

"Eamon was excited at the prospect of making sure New Zealand complied with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.

"He had a distinguished academic career and an unfailing commitment to justice, ethics and human rights for all. Eamon will be sadly missed by many. Our hearts go out to his family at this time," Ms Delahunty said.
