**Green Party saddened by death of Nelson Mandela**

The Green Party expressed sadness at the passing today of Nelson Mandela.

“Nelson Mandela’s life showed how one person’s struggle against the injustices of apartheid and colonisation made a difference,” said Green Party Co-leader Russel Norman.

“Despite Nelson Mandela’s imprisonment and ill treatment at the hands of the South African regime, he, more than anyone else, helped to move his country forward to a new era of democracy.

“Despite Nelson Mandela’s extraordinary achievements he was also a very humble man that readily acknowledged the part others inside and outside South Africa had played in apartheid’s overthrow.

“Our hearts go out to the thousands of others who played their part in the struggle that Nelson Mandela lead. Today will be a great day of sadness for all those who played their part in fighting against the iniquities of apartheid.

“Nelson Mandela was also an inspiration to indigenous people all around the world,” said Dr Norman.

“Whenever visiting countries where indigenous peoples had suffered through colonisation, Nelson Mandela would make certain to highlight past wrongs and suggest ways forward.

“For many New Zealanders and especially Maori who had opposed the Springbok tour of 1981, Nelson Mandela was an inspirational figure.

“His efforts and life since leaving prison and becoming South Africa’s first democratic President have shown the world that justice is inevitable for all oppressed people,” said Dr Norman.

“Nelson Mandela’s story will continue to give hope to all people who suffer under unjust regimes.”
