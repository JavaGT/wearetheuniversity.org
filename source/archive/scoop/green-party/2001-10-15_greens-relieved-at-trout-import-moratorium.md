Greens relieved at trout import moratorium

Green Party Sport and Agriculture Spokesperson Ian Ewen-Street today said the Greens were relieved at the Government decision to keep trout as a non-commercial fishery.

The Government has announced a three year extension to a moratorium on the import of trout flesh.

"The Greens have been concerned about possible plans to import trout flesh into New Zealand both in terms of the impact on the New Zealand fishery and on tourism in New Zealand," said Mr Ewen-Street.

"The New Zealand trout fishery is a significant natural asset that brings tens of thousands of tourists, and millions of dollars, into New Zealand every year.

"Importing trout flesh for commercial sale would invariably lead to illegal poaching of New Zealand trout which could damage the fishery and the tourism in brings," said Mr Ewen-Street.

"Any benefits from importing farmed trout flesh into New Zealand are heavily outweighed by the impacts on our domestic fishery.

"The Greens welcome this move but we urge the Government to continue with, and pass, Mark Burton's Conservation (Protection of Trout as a Non-Commercial Species) Amendment Bill.

"Passing this bill would give New Zealand recreational fishers, guides and tourism operators the security the need."
