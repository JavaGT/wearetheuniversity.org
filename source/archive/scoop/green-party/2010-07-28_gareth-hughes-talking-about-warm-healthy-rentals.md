Gareth Hughes Talking About Warm Healthy Rentals
================================================

**Wednesday, 28 July 2010, 3:52 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

**Gareth Hughes Talking About Warm Healthy Rentals**

**Who:** Green Party MP **Gareth Hughes**  
**What:** Public meeting on warm healthy rentals campaign  
**Where:** Commerce 2.25, University of Otago  
**When:** 12pm, 29 July 2010

Green Party MP Gareth Hughes is touring universities to promote his new member’s bill that will help ensure everyone has a warm home.

Tomorrow Gareth will be in Dunedin talking to students about the substandard housing they have to live in.

Gareth will also be touring cold flats in Dunedin between 3.30 and 4.30pm and will be staying the night in another cold flat - 620 Great King Street (by the University).

Adequate housing is an essential that all New Zealanders should be guaranteed. We know that there are a lot of cold damp rentals out there and that lots of people have to live in them because they don’t have the money to move.
