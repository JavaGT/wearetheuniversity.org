More Mediocrity From Labour On Tertiary Education
=================================================

**Tuesday, 2 July 2002, 3:07 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

2 July 2002

Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos today said Labour was continuing to ignore the structural problems in the tertiary sector, instead offering more tinkering around the edges.

"The Greens will release our own vision for tertiary education at Lincoln this Friday. Students will then see that there is hope for real change and that there is a party that wants to encourage people into education instead of putting them off," said Nandor.

"Labour's talk of a small widening of the eligibility for allowances completely missed the point.

"Why should students up to age 25 be regarded as dependent on their parents and why shouldn't students entering tertiary education be offered the same support as those on the unemployment benefit?" he asked.

Nandor said Labour and the Alliance had failed to address the student loan scheme or introduce universal student allowances. The Labour and Alliance vote against a Green bill to reintroduce the EUB over the summer holidays had been a bitter pill for many students who had elected this Government.

"Labour's announcement today does very little to redress the user pays disaster that swept through the tertiary sector in the late 80s and 1990's. Instead of offering incentives, the current system continues to discourage students from furthering their educations," he said.

"Labour's policy today shows why the Greens must have influence on the next Government. Without the Greens Labour will merely deliver more of the same and that is not in the best interests of students, staff or the country."

Nandor will release the Green Party's tertiary policy at Lincoln University this Friday at midday
