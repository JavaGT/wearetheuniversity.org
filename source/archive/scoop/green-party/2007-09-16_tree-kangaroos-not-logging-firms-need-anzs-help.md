Tree kangaroos, not logging firms, need ANZ's help

Green Media Release - 16th September 2007

The ANZ Banking Group needs to have a hard look at a new report from the World Conservation Union to see the consequences of ANZ's backing a huge logging company, Greens Co-Leader Russel Norman says.

The Green Party has been campaigning against the banking group because of its financial support of Rimbunan Hijau, the most significant logging company clearing rainforest in Papua New Guinea.

A "Red List" of endangered species, just released by the World Conservation Union shows that PNG has more than 60 forest species listed as endangered or vulnerable.

The list comes at the start of New Zealand's outdoor furniture "season". This country takes some 10 percent of PNG's sawn kwila, a tropical timber used for decking and picnic tables.

"Papua New Guinea is a hotspot of biodiversity with some extraordinary forest species listed as critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable, including tree kangaroos, birds of paradise, cassowaries, frogs and bats," says Dr Russel Norman, Green Party Co-Leader.

"Habitat loss due to logging is the major threat to these species.

"The most recent report commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry\* states that around 75% of all logging in PNG is suspected of being illegal, and most of it unsustainable.

"The biggest logging company in PNG is Rimbunan Hijau, which accounts for more than half of all logs processed, occupies a monopolistic position in the economy and has 'undue influence' on the PNG Government according to the MAF report.

"ANZ provides financial support to Rimbunan Hijau in PNG in the form of financial guarantees and foreign exchange services, and hence is facilitating the destruction of the forests that provide the habitat for these 60 vulnerable and endangered species.

Greenpeace has called Rimbunan Hijau one of the most destructive companies operating in Papua New Guinea, yet ANZ are continuing to provide Rimbunan with financial support.

"ANZ should stop their financial support to Rimbunan, and stand with the people of PNG who are risking life and limb in an attempt to stop the illegal logging of their ancient forests.

"The World Conservation Union has identified legal and illegal logging as one of the leading causes of the precarious state of tropical forest species such as the endangered Borneo Orangutan. Rimbunan is also clearing rainforest in Borneo.

The Greens will be continuing our series of colourful protests outside ANZ branches on Monday 8-9am at the ANZ branch on the corner of Victoria and Queen Sts Auckland.
