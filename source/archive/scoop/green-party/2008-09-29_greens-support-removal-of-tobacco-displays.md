Greens support removal of tobacco displays from retail outlets

The Green Party strongly supports the call to remove tobacco displays from their prominent position next to checkout counters in most supermarkets and dairies around New Zealand.

The Health select committee today released a report today calling for tobacco and cigarette displays to be out of sight in retail stores around New Zealand.

"There is no question that having cigarettes prominently displayed at the checkout counters in thousands of retail outlets around New Zealand is a constant temptation to young people and people who have given up smoking," Green Party Health Spokesperson Sue Kedgley says.

"We need to remember that cigarettes are not just ordinary consumer products. They are highly addictive and harmful substances, and tobacco related diseases are a huge burden on society and cost to our economy. So it's crazy to allow these harmful products to be advertised and promoted in almost every dairy and supermarket in the land."

Ms Kedgley says the 20,000-signature petition to remove tobacco displays from sight was strongly supported by public health groups and members of the public during the select committee hearing.

She hopes the Government will act urgently on the Health committee's recommendation and call for the removal of tobacco displays.

"For the sake of our children, we need to remove these displays out of sight, so that children do not see them every time they enter a shop. This would be another positive step in our fight to reduce tobacco related disease."
