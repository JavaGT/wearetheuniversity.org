Green MP to launch Dunedin 'Buy Local' campaign

Green MP Mike Ward will be launching the Dunedin Greens' 'Buy Local' campaign when he visits the city on his South Island Trike tour this weekend.

Mr Ward, the Green Party Spokesperson on Small Business, will kick off the promotion by visiting some of the businesses that have already got on board and presenting them with their 'Buy Local' stickers. The Dunedin Greens will then be approaching other companies over the next few months to ask them to encourage their customers to 'Buy Local'. They will also be installing a 'Buy Local' window display at their Stewart Street office.

Nelson-based Mr Ward, 61, is cycling 1021km from Bluff to Nelson to promote how easy it is to be Green and to gather stories to take to Parliament. A North Island leg will follow next spring.
