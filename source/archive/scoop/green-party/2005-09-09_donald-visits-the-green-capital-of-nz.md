Donald visits the Green capital of NZ

Green Co-Leader Rod Donald takes his campaign to Golden Bay today.

Mr Donald will be holding a lunchtime meeting at the Mussel Inn, at Onekaka, between Takaka and Collingwood.

"At the last election, the Green Party won 48 percent of the party vote at the Onekaka polling booth, making Onekaka the Green capital of New Zealand," Mr Donald said.

"Media are welcome to join me at the Mussel Inn for a Strong Ox, one of the best beers in the country, and a bowl of sausages."

In the afternoon, Mr Donald and Green MP and Nelson Candidate Mike Ward will visit businesses in the city, including an organic health food shop in which the Green MPs' super fund has just invested $50,000.

Mr Donald and Mr Ward will also be speaking at a public meeting in Nelson tonight, where they will be announcing a Buy Kiwi Made Campaign, including a funding package to promote New Zealand products to Kiwi consumers.

Noon: Public meeting, 'Eat your Greens', Mussel Inn, Onekaka, Golden Bay.

7.30pm: Public meeting, 'Free Market Slavery or Fair Trade and Buy NZ Made', Balling Theatre, Nelson School of Music, 48 Nile St, Nelson.
