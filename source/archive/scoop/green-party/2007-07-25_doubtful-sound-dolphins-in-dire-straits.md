Doubtful Sound dolphins in dire straits

The Greens are calling for urgent action over the plight of the Doubtful Sound bottlenose dolphin. "The entire Doubtful Sound dolphin population is only 56 animals and they are unique to Fiordland. Sadly, they are increasingly at risk from tourist boats operating within their habitat," says Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei.

"Why are these precious animals treated so differently from Takahe, for example, with only 130 remaining, who are intensively-managed in an entry-by-permit-only Special Area in the Murchison Mountains less than 20 kilometres away; or the 86 Kakapo which have an island sanctuary with no public entry?

"The Department of Conservation has just released a discussion document with options for their protection and people across New Zealand should be advocating for the strongest possible measures. Just as with the more widely known critically endangered Maui dolphin, these dolphins are at risk from human activity and we must not allow them to become extinct at our hands.

"Researchers at Otago University claim the bottlenose dolphin population in the fiord could be extinct within 30 years because of pressure from tourism. Doubtful Sound is an eco-tourism crown for New Zealand, but we run the risk of driving its very jewel to extinction," Mrs Turei says.

"Milford Sound is already at tourist capacity, and there is increasing pressure on Doubtful Sound - the only other readily accessible cruise destination - as a result.

"A recent Environment Court decision, which allows tourist operators to continue within a critical area of the dolphin's habitat, Bradshaw Sound, shows that we cannot rely on existing law to protect vulnerable marine mammals from the harm of economic interests. We need to intervene quickly with strong conservation measures that are not subject to commercial pressures but which are solely directed towards the protection and restoration of these fragile populations.

"The Minister of Conservation should act as quickly as possible to protect these dolphins. This may mean extending no boat-zones and permit-only areas, even closing all of Crooked Arm and Bradshaw Sound except to permit holders. Tourist operators may object to restrictions, but they will have little to sell if the dolphins become extinct.

"Long term, the DOC threat management plan is very important in the fight to protect these animals. Submissions on the plan close on September 5th. However, the longer the process takes the more chance it could be too late. Let's hope that time has not run out for these dolphins," Mrs Turei says.
