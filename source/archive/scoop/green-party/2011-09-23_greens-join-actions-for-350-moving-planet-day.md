Green MPs will be out en force around the country tomorrow on the global day of action to move the planet away from fossil fuels, organised by climate action group 350.

"Moving Planet" is a global day of action dedicated to moving the planet away from fossil fuels. Thousands of events are planned in over 170 countries around the world.

“It’s not too late to avoid catastrophic climate change,” said Dr Kennedy Graham, Green Party spokesperson on International Climate Change Issues.

“We have the opportunity right now to develop a clean green economy that protects our people and the planet.

“That is why Green MPs will be joining New Zealanders across the country to call for real action on climate change. We need to ensure that our global and national emissions peak and reduce within the next 5 years. ”
