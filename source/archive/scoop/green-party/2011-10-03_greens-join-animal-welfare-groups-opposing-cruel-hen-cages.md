**Greens to join animal welfare groups opposing cruel hen cages**

_**What:**_ Press conference regarding action against colony cages  
_**Who:**_ _**Green MP Sue Kedgley**_, SAFE, RNZSPCA  
**Where:** Museum room, Turnbull House, 11 Bowen Street, Wellington  
**When:** From 10am, 4 October 2011

**Green Party animal welfare spokesperson Sue Kedgley** will join New Zealand’s leading animal welfare advocacy groups SAFE and the RNZSPCA in calling on the Minister of Agriculture to prevent the use of colony cages. The Government is considering replacing cruel battery cages with so-called ‘enriched’ colony cages.

In August, Ms Kedgley produced documents showing that the Ministry of Agriculture had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars assisting the egg industry to move from one cruel cage system (battery cages) to another (colony cages), instead of requiring the industry to shift to free-range or barn systems.

Animal welfare experts consider colony cages offer no better conditions for hens than those they are currently enduring.

“If people saw colony cages close up they would be horrified. I've seen hens in these colony cages – and they are really no different to battery hen cages - they are just as unspeakably cruel," Ms Kedgley said.
