Greens across the country push for action on climate change

Green Media Advisory November 3 2006

Green Party members are organising more than 30 different activities around the country to publicise International Day of Action on Climate Change, Saturday November 4th. The full list of activities is below.

"It's time to translate talk into action", says Green Co-Leader Russel Norman.

"Green members will be handing out leaflets (http://www.greens.org.nz/campaigns/climate/6pack.pdf) about the six new climate change private members' bills that the Greens are putting into the ballot as well as giving people ideas on how they themselves can reduce their individual greenhouse emissions.

"Greens will also be providing a free bus, showing Al Gore's film, showing the impact of sea level rise by marking buildings, having a carbon free picnic, melting clocks frozen in ice, holding stalls and much more.

"New Zealand's greenhouse emissions have grown rapidly under National and Labour - it's time for action. We need to play our part to stop catastrophic climate change."
