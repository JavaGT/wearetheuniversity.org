Conservationists' commitment congratulated

Conservationists who moved into Happy Valley one year ago on Sunday to protest a mining company's plans to destroy one of New Zealand's rarest alpine wetland habitats should be congratulated for their perseverance, the Green Party says.

"The commitment shown by the Save Happy Valley Coalition is awe inspiring," Greens' Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.

"Happy Valley is home to the great spotted kiwi, the giant carnivorous snail Powelliphanta Augustus, kaka, kakariki and western weka. The area is unique for its tussock wetlands and the presence of rare bryophytes; iverworts and mosses.

"And the occupation has been a success: the area remains free of bulldozers, the wildlife continues to live there undisturbed. Many people have travelled to the site, including myself, to bear witness to its natural beauty. The plight of Happy Valley is now well-known to New Zealanders.

"The group has persevered despite enduring disappointments during the year, most importantly the decision by the Government to allow Solid Energy - its own state-owned enterprise - to mine the only known habitat of Powelliphanta Augustus,

"Members of the group have been spied on by private investigators, they've been rained on, faced bitterly cold weather and have been threatened by Solid Energy with the prospect of paying thousands of dollars in court costs.

"This is true commitment to caring for New Zealand's fragile environment," Mrs Turei says.

"If our Conservation Minister showed that same commitment, our list of rare and endangered species would be far shorter than it is."
