Buy and eat local produce this Christmas plead Greens

Green Party Buy Local and Christmas Issues Spokesperson Mike Ward is making a special plea to New Zealanders to up the Kiwi content of their Christmas dinner this year.

He says there is no excuse for eating less than fresh, local produce grown in a country that has produced food for a thousand years.

“There are many more good reasons for buying and eating fresh, local produce at Christmas than there are for eating imports,” said Mr Ward. "Apart from strengthening local economies and improving the chances of our money finding its way into the pockets of the people we care about, New Zealand produce tastes so good at this time of the year.”

“It also requires very little preparation. There is nothing simpler or yummier than bowls of blueberries, raspberries and boysenberries served with nothing more elaborate than cream, yoghurt and ice cream and perhaps a sprinkle of icing sugar.

“And for carnivores, New Zealand ham, mutton, pork, smoked chicken or fish accompanied with tomatoes, lettuce, spring onion, cucumbers, avocado, capsicum, fresh beans, peas with new potatoes is hard to beat."

Mr Ward said fresh, local, in-season, unpackaged and unprocessed is also the most economical way to eat.

“I’m happy to admit that growing, buying, preparing, sharing or eating food is a personal passion of mine. Life ought to be a series of highlights and meal times are great opportunities for a celebration.

"Most people aren't keen to spend all of Christmas in the kitchen, so share the work around and if you can't be bothered making your own food and drinks, seek out the products that our fellow New Zealanders are making - chocolates, wines and squeezed fruit juice.

"Many might ask: Is it possible to eat 100 percent New Zealand this Christmas? Well it's a challenge, but it shouldn't be beyond the collective imagination of the average New Zealand family.

“And if you can up the organic content at the same time, the taste buds are likely to really sit up and take notice. Buying local is the antithesis of globalisation. It is about spending our money in ways that pamper the palate, enrich our individual communities and minimise our impact on the planet."
