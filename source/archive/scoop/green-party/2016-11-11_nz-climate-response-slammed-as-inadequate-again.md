NZ climate response slammed as ‘inadequate’, again

Global climate experts have exposed an enormous credibility gap between the National Government's rhetoric on climate change and its actions, the Green Party said today.

New Zealand’s response to climate change has today been [labelled ‘inadequate’](http://climateactiontracker.org/countries/newzealand.html) for the fourth year in a row by [Climate Action Tracker](http://climateactiontracker.org/about.html) – an international group of climate science researchers.

New Zealand is ranked below the European Union, China, USA and India.

"Climate experts are effectively calling out the National Government for greenwashing," said Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter.

“New Zealand has been lumped in with the likes of Saudi Arabia, the Ukraine and Russia as laggards on climate action.

“The report states that ‘implemented policies are highly insufficient to meet New Zealand's 2030 climate target’, and that ‘climate policies are small in scale and mitigation potential’.

"The report shows that under current policies, New Zealand's emissions could balloon to 114 percent above 1990 levels.

"Now more than ever, New Zealand needs to stand up for what’s right and join with countries showing leadership on climate change.

“That means investing in electric rail lines in Auckland rather than more motorways, and building renewable electricity generation rather than Nova’s proposed gas-power plant in south Waikato.

“We don't have the luxury anymore of been able to freeride on the hard work of other countries that are taking climate change seriously,” said Ms Genter.
