The Way Ahead? Post-election directions for transport policy in Auckland

Tuesday 2nd November, 7pm, Green Party Office, 308 Great North Road, Grey Lynn

The council election results were a huge breakthrough for proponents of sustainable transport. Now we have a real opportunity to get Auckland moving in the right direction. You are invited to come and discuss solutions with our guest speaker Jan Scheurer. Jan is an urban design and transport planning expert from RMIT University, Melbourne. An advocate of car free cities, he has been involved in community campaigns on sustainable transport in Perth, Barcelona, Copenhagen and Hamburg since 1989.

All welcome – Free admission – Tea/coffee provided
