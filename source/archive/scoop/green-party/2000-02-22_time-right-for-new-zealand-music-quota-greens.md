Time Right For New Zealand Music Quota - Greens
===============================================

On the launch of his nation-wide campus tour Green MP Nandor Tanczos today said it was time to start talking seriously about radio quota for New Zealand music.

Nandor Tanczos is visiting around a dozen tertiary campuses over the next two weeks when most campuses are holding orientation weeks. He is giving public talks, holding meetings and conducting numerous interviews.

\"Orientation at New Zealand universities and polytechs has always been a celebration of New Zealand music," he said. "This time round there are some incredible line-ups of some of the very best New Zealand music."

However Mr Tanczos said it was sad that top musicians traditionally found it difficult to succeed in New Zealand and that it was a shame New Zealanders didn't hear more of their own music on their radio stations.

"Shihad are performing in New Zealand this orientation and I'm really looking forward to checking them out in the Wellington Town Hall. Like a number of top Kiwi musicians, however, they are now based abroad and this drift out of New Zealand is often due to the lack of support in this country," he said.

Mr Tanczos acknowledged the success of festivals such as the New Zealand Music Week but said radio had a responsibility to ensure broadcasts reflected the culture and identity of New Zealand listeners.

He said it was sad that only around five per cent of all music on commercial radio was New Zealand music but praised student radio, National Radio and Channel Z, among others, for their efforts in broadcasting more local music.

"The orientation festivals across the country provide the perfect opportunity to start discussing how New Zealand can better support, retain and encourage our musicians and artists.

"The Greens see quotas and the creation of a national youth radio network as the best way of achieving this. Quotas have given the South African music industry a massive boost and we hope to get this issue onto the agenda and work closely with the government to see rapid movement in this area."
