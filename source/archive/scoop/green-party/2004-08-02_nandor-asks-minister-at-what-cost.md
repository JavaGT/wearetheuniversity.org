Nandor asks minister: "at what cost?"

Green MP Nandor Tanczos today congratulated the Minister for Tertiary Education on his announcement that just over 10,000 students will be receiving fee reductions next year but questioned the real cost of that reduction.

"International students at Otago University are facing fee increases of up to 23 per cent for 2005 and International students at Waikato University faced increases of 6.7 per cent," said Nandor, the Green Tertiary Education spokesperson.

"Also due to the exceptions granted to various institutions, some students will still be seeing fee rises of up to 10 per cent.

"The Government is trying to keep fees down but they are only succeeding at contributing to the uncertainty new students are feeling as to what is to happen to their fees over the course of their degree.

"The Greens call on the Government to give students certainty by capping all resident student University fees at $1500 per year and Grandparenting for International Student fees," he said.
