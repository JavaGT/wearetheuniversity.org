Greens celebrate passage of Healthy Homes Bill

The Green Party is today celebrating the passing of the Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill, which works towards ensuring that no New Zealanders get sick from the house they live in.

“The passing of this legislation will make a huge difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of New Zealand families,” said Green Party housing spokesperson Marama Davidson.

“The Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill will significantly improve the quality of rental accommodation, lifting children out of poverty and helping to reduce deaths from preventable diseases.

“I congratulate Minister Twyford for ensuring the passage of this legislation so early on in the term of the new Government.

“National had nine years to improve situations for tenants, but under their watch things only got worse.

“We are proud to have put minimum housing standards and renters’ rights on the political agenda.

“My colleague Gareth Hughes brought the first rental warrant of fitness bill to Parliament in 2010, and National voted down a similar bill in the name of Metiria Turei in 2016.

“We will continue to push for everyone to have a warm, dry and affordable home to call their own and today marks a significant step in achieving that,” said Ms Davidson.
