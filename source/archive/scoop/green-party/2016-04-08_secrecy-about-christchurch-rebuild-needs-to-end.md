Secrecy about Christchurch rebuild needs to end

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee must stop pretending the central city rebuild is all fine and dandy and tell the people of Christchurch what’s holding up two key anchor projects in the central city, the Green Party said today.

Gerry Brownlee today launched a stream of abuse at Treasury officials who have blasted the Government’s central city rebuild as the worst performing of the Government’s major projects. The Treasury red-flagged the two anchor projects for the central city: the Christchurch convention centre and the regeneration of Otakaro/Avon River and surrounds.

“The people of Christchurch deserve answers. It’s totally unacceptable for the Minister to respond to the serious concerns raised by the Treasury with a stream of abuse,” Green Party Canterbury Rebuild spokesperson Eugenie Sage said.

“People want to know when these key projects will be finished, and how the concerns raised by the Treasury and others will be addressed.

“Millions of dollars of public money and the city’s future are at stake. Ngai Tahu has already pulled out of the Convention Centre, and we are losing an opportunity to build a vibrant and sustainable city.

“The Government needs to heed the Treasury’s warnings and front up about what’s going on. It’s better to rethink the anchor projects now, than land Christchurch with unaffordable, shoddy white elephants,” Ms Sage said.
