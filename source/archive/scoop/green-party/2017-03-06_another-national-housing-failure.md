Another National housing failure  

With new data showing building consents for new homes are [trending down](http://www.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/industry_sectors/Construction/BuildingConsentsIssued_MRJan17.aspx), the Government must do the responsible thing and step up to build more affordable homes, the Green Party said today.

“We have a serious housing crisis and it’s time for new thinking to solve it,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

“National might talk big when it comes to housing, but the numbers don’t lie. Simply not enough new homes are being built for all the people who need them.

“Our country’s history is full of examples of governments stepping up and building affordable homes, and it’s time for that history to be repeated.

“There are families living in cars and tents right now, but National is failing to make sure enough new homes are getting built.

“It’s incredible that after nine years, National is still refusing to build more houses for the people who need them.

“It’s clear that we need to change the government to see thousands of new affordable homes built and made available to families with [rent-to-buy programmes](https://www.greens.org.nz/home-for-life),” Mrs Turei said.
