**Green Party celebrates cross party approach to tackle the wellbeing of Maori children**

“Today’s inquiry hearings into the determinants of wellbeing of Maori children is a positive example of a cross party approach to an issue, says Green Party Co-Leader Metiria Turei.

The Aotearoa Equality Group, convened by Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei and Labour MP Louisa Wall, have been promoting this inquiry.

“Louise Wall and I are really pleased that this inquiry was accepted by the Maori Affairs committee. It is the first parliamentary inquiry into the solutions Maori propose for the wellbeing of our Maori children.

“The inquiry was developed by a cross party group which included child advocacy organisations.

“It is very important to have a specific focus on Maori children and to hear solutions from Maori.

“Government is working on the White Paper for Vulnerable Children and other government agencies prepare policy, but too often Maori solutions are ignored.

“This inquiry has been opened to everyone, to academics and policy experts, as well as whanau. Whanau can no longer be ignored. Whanau have solutions and today we make the space for Members of Parliament to hear them.
