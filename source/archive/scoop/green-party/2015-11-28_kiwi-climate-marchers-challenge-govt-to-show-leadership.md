Thousands of Kiwi climate marchers challenge Govt to show leadership  

  
The tens of thousands of Kiwis who marched in solidarity around the country today sent a loud and clear message to the Government that they want a climate change plan New Zealand can be proud of, the Green Party said today.

The New Zealand People’s Climate Marches, which continue tomorrow, are part of a worldwide weekend of action to urge political leaders to agree to a meaningful plan to combat climate change at the upcoming COP talks in Paris.

“Tens of thousands of New Zealanders have stood up for the climate today – it’s time John Key and the Government did the same,” said Green Party Co-leader James Shaw, who was one of the more than 15,000 people who marched in Auckland.

“The Paris COP talks are an opportunity for New Zealand to show leadership on a global scale but we’re heading there with one of the most woefully low pollution-reduction targets in the world.

“The Government’s current plan for reducing domestic climate pollution is completely inadequate, and that message was heard loud and clear today, all around the country.

“The nationwide action today was reminiscent of the massive marches against this Government’s plan to mine our national parks, which they finally ditched after listening to the people.

“The Government should listen to the thousands of New Zealanders who took to the streets today and come up with a stronger, more ambitious plan for reducing climate pollution.

“The whole world will be watching Paris ­– this is the opportunity of a lifetime and New Zealand must step up and show some leadership,” said Mr Shaw.
