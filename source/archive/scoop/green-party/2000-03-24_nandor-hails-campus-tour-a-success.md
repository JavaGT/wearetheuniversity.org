Nandor Hails Campus Tour A Success
==================================

**Friday, 24 March 2000, 9:36 am**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green MP Nandor Tanczos completes his speaking tour of New Zealand tertiary institutions today, having visited over a dozen universities and polytechnics during their orientation weeks.

Nandor has a series of engagements in Wanganui today which will officially bring his tour to a close. He said the tour was exhausting but incredibly rewarding and encouraging, and that the Green message went down extremely well with students.

\"It was really encouraging to see young people begin to show an interest in politics again after years of disinterest," he said. "I really appreciated the opportunity to listen to and talk with so many people with so many good ideas on how we can make this country, and this world, a better place."

Nandor gave speeches to crowds of up to 600 students and covered issues such as the environment, tertiary education, restorative justice, the Treaty of Waitangi and cannabis law reform.

On his tour Mr Tanczos accepted invitations to attend commemorations at Moutua Gardens in Wanganui and a national hui on drug use among Maori youth in Whangaruru. He gave a talk to ten-year-old school children, attended an alternative school in the Hawkes Bay, gave a press conference to journalism students, gave over 40 interviews and held over 15 public meetings.

Mr Tanczos said he was overwhelmed by the awareness of young people on a wide range of issues and was delighted at student interest in the Greens.

Since the election over 700 people have joined the Green Party, many as a direct result of the campus tour.
