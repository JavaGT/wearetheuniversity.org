Protest against the Infringing File Sharing Amendment Bill

What: Protest against the Infringing File Sharing Amendment  
When: 12–3pm Saturday 27 August  
Where: Aotea Square  
Who: Green MP Gareth Hughes

Green Party technology spokesperson Gareth Hughes will be attending the protest against the Infringing File Sharing Amendment Bill in Auckland tomorrow.  
Green MP Kevin Hague will also speak at the Christchurch protest.

The protest, organised primarily through Facebook and online discussion forums, is protesting the use of urgency to pass the law as well as the guilt-on-accusation nature of the law and the draconian three strikes clause which puts schools, universities and libraries at risk of fines or possible account disconnection.

The Green Party was the only party to vote against this controversial law and is encouraging greater availability of online content as a more effective means of reducing illegal online sharing.

“This law will have a chilling effect on public Wi-Fi internet and mean big costs for small businesses, schools and universities who will be responsible for all infringing on their account,” Mr Hughes said.

“The cost-recovery model adopted by the Government for ISPs to send the 3-strike notices could also see internet cost rises.

“The Government hasn’t done enough to prepare the public or schools for the introduction of this law who will face the penalties as account holders.”

Mr Hughes said that even the Speaker of Parliament would be liable for any infringing on the Parliamentary internet account.

“We support Kiwi creatives and think encouraging greater legal content available online would be more effective than this law which makes it cheaper and faster for large, very-profitable corporate media companies to enforce their old distribution models,” Mr Hughes said.
