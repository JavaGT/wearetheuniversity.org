More stupid school rules

Green Youth Affairs Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos today said he was struck by the sheer stupidity of a ban on eating in public for students at Macleans College.

"How petty is it to ban students from eating and drinking on the way to and from school?" said Nandor.

"The school needs to think about what it is there for, to provide students with a decent education or enforce a bunch of silly rules that serve no purpose?" he asked.

"Many people are becoming concerned at the mindlessness of many school rules. Where will it end?"

Nandor said the principal of Macleans should be more worried about whether students were coming to school at all rather than them catching breakfast on the go.

"No wonder there is a high truancy rate in some schools if this is what students have to put up with."
