Greens urge students to make submissions on WINZ

Green co-leader Rod Donald is urging tertiary students across the country to write submissions for the Ministerial review into WINZ.

Submissions from groups and individuals are now open as part of the review and Mr Donald congratulated State Services Minister Trevor Mallard for allowing all groups and individuals to make submissions on their experiences with WINZ.

"The Greens are very pleased that the submission process is wide and inclusive and we urge every student who has had problems with WINZ to tell their story," he said.

"Only then will the Government be able to get a truly accurate picture of exactly what has been going wrong in WINZ, and the impact this has had on tens of thousands of New Zealand students," he said.

"We have heard a lot about loan difficulties this year but we also know that post graduate students have had serious difficulties accessing allowances and other students have had similar problems getting the community wage student," he said.

"Of all of the groups dealing with WINZ it appears as though students have got the roughest deal."

Mr Donald said he has already been contacted by many students and was passing their experiences on to the inquiry as case studies. He will continue gathering material from students who wish to deal through him and will himself be making a submission to the inquiry.

Submissions should be addressed to:

Mr Don Hunn  
Ministerial Review Team - WINZ  
c/o - Office of Hon Trevor Mallard  
Minister of State Services  
Parliament Buildings  
WELLINGTON

No stamp is required.
