Greens Welcome Ongoing Support For Environmental Education

Green Party education spokesperson Ian Ewen-Street today welcomed ongoing support in the Budget for a primary and secondary schools' environmental education programme.

This Green Party budget initiative, negotiated with Education Minister Trevor Mallard, will see a further $500,000 from Vote Education put toward the programme over two years.

"We negotiated this important programme as part of last year's Green Package, and we're delighted with Mr Mallard's continued support for it. It brings the total figure for this programme to $750,000 over three years," said Mr Ewen-Street.

"Environmental education is a vital part of preparing students for the future - ensuring that students understand ecological processes and that all economic and social activities are utterly dependent on the environment," said Mr Ewen-Street.

"If schools are to meet their curriculum requirements in science, health, technology, social studies and physical education, students must have a firm understanding of sustainable land management, energy, water, and waste-reduction issues, biodiversity protection, and the natural cycles on which our lives depend."

"This renewed funding will enable the programme to be expanded to cover more geographical areas, and facilitate research about effective inclusion and integration of environmental education into school curriculums."

It will also allow for development of further resources, including Te Reo Maori, which are required to assist in the effective delivery of environmental education across the curriculum.
