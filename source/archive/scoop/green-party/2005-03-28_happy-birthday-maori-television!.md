Happy birthday Maori Television!

Happy birthday Maori Television!

The Greens are wishing the Maori Television Service a very happy first birthday tomorrow.

“I wholeheartedly congratulate MTS on its success over the last twelve months in providing quality New Zealand-grown television that is enjoyed by thousands of Maori and Pakeha New Zealanders,” Green Maori Affairs Spokesperson Metiria Turei.

“I’m proud that the Greens voted for the Maori Television Service Bill. If it hadn’t been for our support, the Bill wouldn’t have passed and the Maori Television Service wouldn’t have been established. The station’s success over the past year shows that we made the right call.

“It is absolutely critical that our country has a television station committed to showing the broad spectrum of Maori views and lives, that both celebrates and critiques contemporary Maori existence.

“Maori Television is doing a fantastic job of exposing the range of Maori experience and providing Reo services to our nation. We are one of very few monolingual countries in the world, and we should embrace our indigenous language as a key part of our national identity.”

“Of course, the Greens congratulate all the staff at Maori Television for their commitment to the kaupapa. It is the people on the ground researching, reporting and filming that make the station such a success, given the ups and downs suffered in the station’s management.”
