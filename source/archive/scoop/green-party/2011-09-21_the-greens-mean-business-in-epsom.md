**The Greens Mean Business in Epsom**

The Green Party launches its Epsom Campaign today with a gala event including a prestigious line up and invitation list. “We’re going to make a splash,“ Epsom candidate David Hay said. “The launch will say, loud and clear, that the Greens mean business in Epsom. We want to foster green business and low-carbon enterprise that will enrich our communities now and in the future.”

The keynote speaker for the launch is Auckland University Business School professor Susan St John. Musical entertainment is being provided by Mike Chunn’s Play It Strange and an auction will be held featuring original art works by Richard Killeen and Ralph Hotere and a “mystery item” from the Rainbow Warrior, which was sunk in Auckland Harbour in 1985. Sara Noble, Epsom Campaign Coordinator, says “The Epsom community is brimming with creative and professional people who are keen to make a difference. The support is fantastic.”

“Epsom voters are astute,” Mr Hay said “They want a smart, green economy that works for everyone. Epsom and the Green Party are at the forefront of this thinking.”

Mr Hay, an economist and public policy analyst who grew up in Epsom, says that the area has always had a large population of health-care professionals, educators and artists who support the Greens. “Now we’re seeing the business community join us,” he said. “More and more businesses want good Green growth and are seeking sustainable business solutions.”  
Our economy and our environment are inseparable, says Mr Hay. “As an economist, I know that in protecting our natural wealth, we are protecting our future“.

The Green Party’s election campaign is centred on the slogan, “For a Richer New Zealand Party Vote Green.” The Greens emphasise that quality of life is the issue stating that a richer New Zealand is one which is more happy, healthy, connected and equal.
