New exhaust rules will clear the air

The Green Party is delighted to have worked with the Government in developing a plan for New Zealand's first ever controls on vehicle emissions.

The Government announced today that New Zealand is finally to get minimum emission performance standards, with mandatory testing of exhaust emissions to form part of the warrant-of-fitness check. Used and new imports will have to meet appropriate standards before they are registered.

"Motor vehicles produce more air pollution than any other human activity in New Zealand," Green Party Transport Spokesperson, Jeanette Fitzsimons said today. "They are also contribute significantly to the level of greenhouse gas emissions.

"New Zealand is the only OECD country that does not have compulsory vehicle emissions testing, despite possessing an ageing and dirty vehicle fleet, the emissions from which contribute to hundreds of deaths and thousands of serious health problems every year.

"I get dozens of letters every year from people who can't understand how a civilised country still has no emissions controls," said Ms Fitzsimons. "It is great that this is to change.

"Tuning vehicles properly to make them run cleaner gives us a triple whammy - less air pollution, less climate changing greenhouse gas, and savings for the motorist. A well-tuned car uses less fuel to go the same distance - some cars are so badly tuned they are using 30 per cent more fuel than they need to."

The Green Party has been campaigning for mandatory vehicle emissions testing for years, and has been working closely with government on this issue.

Jeanette will be at the launch of the Government's emissions policy in Auckland at midday today at the Waitakere City Testing Station in Henderson.
