Nandor challenges Dunne to listen to the experts

Green MP Nandor Tanczos is endorsing calls for a more sensible policy on cannabis by the co-author of a major medical report.

Dr Richie Poulton, co-author of a paper by an Otago School of Medicine multi-disciplinary team, told National Radio today the new findings highlighted the need for a more sensible policy on cannabis.

"These finding back up what the Green have been saying for years," said Nandor. "The younger that people use cannabis, and the more cannabis they use, the more likely it is that they will have problems.

"We need an age limit for cannabis. We need to promote moderation for those that do use it. Right now, because of Peter Dunne's deal with Labour to keep drug law reform off the legislative agenda, the illegal market in drugs is booming.

"Dr Poulton affirmed today that around three quarters of young people have tried cannabis and that the law does not stop them using it. He argued for better health promotion and education, and a non-punitive approach. The Greens back that, with the addition of an age limit to protect kids."

Nandor congratulated the Otago team for conducting the research into cannabis, saying that New Zealand was leading the world in this area.

"It is just a shame that people like Peter Dunne refuse to deal with the facts. This issue is just too important for the future of our young people to play politics with."
