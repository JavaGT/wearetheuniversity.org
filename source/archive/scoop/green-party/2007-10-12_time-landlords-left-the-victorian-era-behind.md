Time landlords left the Victorian era behind - Fitzsimons

"It is time landlords stopped sheltering behind the story of cheap rents to avoid insulating their rental properties," said Jeanette Fitzsimons, Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation.

She was commenting on the statement by Paul Kinley of the Canterbury Property Investors Association in the Press today, referring to the release yesterday of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy.

"Government has for some months now offered to pay half the cost of insulating a rental property. The full capital value of that subsidy accrues to the landlord. Yet many of them are still not willing to pay the other half.

"Meanwhile their tenants suffer from asthma, colds and flu that are avoidable.

"It is poor economics to try to keep rents down but let power bills go up, with people still getting sick. After all, we are not seeking gold plated upgrades - just a decent standard of living where people can keep warm."

Ms Fitzsimons congratulated Stuart Shutt, Director of Investor Homes, who was quoted in the Herald today saying "I wouldn't live in an uninsulated home, and I wouldn't expect my tenants to".

"This is the kind of responsible attitude we are trying to encourage," said Ms Fitzsimons.

For tenants in serious need there are accommodation supplements available to assist.

"I would love to see EECA swamped by requests from landlords for the generous 50% subsidy," said Ms Fitzsimons. "But if, after several years opportunity, some are still unwilling, we will have to consider a regulatory approach."
