Greens mark new education law 'not achieved'

Greens mark new education law 'not achieved'

  
The Government's 'get tough' and 'more measurement' approach to education is ill-conceived and will have destructive effects, the Green Party says.

The Education (National Standards) Achievement Bill, to be passed under urgency before Christmas, will do nothing to improve educational standards, Education Spokesperson Catherine Delahunty says.

"Fining parents when their children are truant is a bizarre concept that will only have negative consequences. Truancy levels are an indicator that students are feeling alienated from their schools. Punishing parents financially will not improve the situation but will create even more stress for poor families.

"No-one has asked students why they are truant because it would expose the real problems in the education system. Schools need more resources and smaller class sizes so that they can be relevant to their students' learning needs.

"This Government's focus on getting tough and more measurement in education will achieve nothing positive."

The Green Party supports NZEI's call for proper consultation and a Select Committee process to discuss educational standards issues.

"Rushing legislation through in urgency, without a chance for people to have their say is undemocratic. I hope the Government will take heed of voices raised in protest."
