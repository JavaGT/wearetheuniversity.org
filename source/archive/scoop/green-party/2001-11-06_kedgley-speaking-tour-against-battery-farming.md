Kedgley launches speaking tour against battery farming

Green Animal Welfare Spokesperson Sue Kedgley will tonight hold the first in a series of public talks around the country opposing battery farming.

Ms Kedgley will speak tonight at the Manawatu Science Centre in Palmerston North at 7.30pm.

Following times and places are:

Nov 7 - Hamilton, Waikato University, 7.30pm. Contact Gary Clarkson 07 853 7122

Nov 14 - Christchurch, WEA 59 Gloucester St, 7.30pm

Nov 28 - Auckland, Grey Lynn Hall, 7.30pm. Contact Karen Kee 09 336 1455

Dec 5 - Dunedin, Arc Café, 7.30pm Contact Duncan Eddy 03 477 8502

Ms Kedgley said the use of the sow crate - a small metal crate in which a pig cannot even turn around - in pig farming was incredibly cruel and the time had come to ban it.

"Factory farming and the use of the battery cage for hens and the sow crate for pigs are this country's dark farming secret and the more consumers find out there more appalled they are.

"The Greens are joining a major SPCA and SAFE campaign to end the use of the sow crate and we are starting by letting people know exactly what goes on in factory farms up and down this country."
