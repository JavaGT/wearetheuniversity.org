Turei to challenge the prohibitionists' hypocrisy tonight

Metiria Turei will tonight be challenging prohibitionists to provide arguments based on real evidence as to how criminalising adult cannabis smokers actually reduces the harm caused by the drug.

The Dunedin-based Green MP will be one of a number of speakers at the 'Cannabis and Prohibition: weighing the harms' forum at the University of Otago.

"I want these people who favour the current legal regime around cannabis to explain their hypocrisy in not also calling for the prohibition of alcohol," said Mrs Turei.

"The Greens have consistently argued that the best way to stop young people using cannabis, alcohol or anything else is to have a clear age limit that is seriously policed. We need to undo the black market, because as long as cannabis is sold through tinny houses, there is no way to stop teenagers getting access to it."

Mrs Turei will also be calling for a rule change around the use of 'medical marijuana'.

The University's medical school and political science department, the Labour and United Future parties, the Destiny Church and the Community Action on Youth and Drugs will all be represented at the event.

What: Metiria Turei at the 'Cannabis and Prohibition: weighing the harms'.  
When: 6pm TONIGHT, Friday 13 May.  
Where: Quad 2 lecture theatre in the Geology building behind the Registry,  
Leith St, Otago University.

ENDS
