Greens Committed To Reducing Tertiary Fees
==========================================

**Thursday, 30 September 1999, 2:15 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The Green Party says it is committed to reducing student fees for tertiary education.

Green Party Education spokesperson Michael Tritt said the party planned a "social contract" scheme where the government would pay students' fees and in return students would have to do paid work or community work.

One year's work would equal the repayment of one year's tertiary fees. Or else students would be able to do the work in advance and build up credits for their education, Mr Tritt said.
