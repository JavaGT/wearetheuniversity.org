### Greens announce hip hop tour of universities

The Green Party today announced that it will be carrying out a hip hop tour of universities to help raise student’s awareness of environmental and social justice issues.

“We are always keen to find new ways to reach out to people not involved in politics and we think a hip hop tour is a great way to connect with a younger audience,” said Green Party youth spokesperson Gareth Hughes.

“On a personal level I’m keen to use this as an opportunity to change the image that we are all into morris dancing. I myself only morris dance semi-regularly and I don’t think it reflects the Green Party’s full range of dance interests.”

Gareth Hughes will be joined by Co-leader Russel Norman and David Clendon on the hip hop tour. The group is known as the Massive Salad and will feature MCs G-Roar (Mr Hughes), Rad (Dr Norman), and LL Cool D (Professor Clendon).

“I’ve been using LL Cool D for a while now,” added Prof Clendon,” It actually stands for ladies love cool David but I find the acronym less of a mouthful.”

“My mum always tells me how rad I am, so I decided to use it as my mc name,” said Dr Norman.

A sample from Massive Salad’s great green conversation song is outlined below:

“We are rolling ridiculous, but you know we dress meticulous,” kicked in G-Roar.

“I’m a hip hop hippopotamus, who never gets drunk and lost,” rumbled LL Cool D.

“I’m the Rad, I’m red, and I’m really really bad, my steps are so quick, my steps are so fast. My hair is ginger, I’m a bit like a ninja,” roared Dr Norman.

“We green, we great, there aint no need to hate,” all MCs.

The hip hop tour begins on the first of April 2011 at Victoria University.
