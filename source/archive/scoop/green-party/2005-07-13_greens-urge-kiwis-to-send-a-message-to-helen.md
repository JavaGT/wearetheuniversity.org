Greens urge Kiwis to send a message to Helen on Zimbabwe

The Green Party is urging New Zealanders to send Prime Minister Helen Clark a clear message that they want her Government to do everything in its power to stop the Black Caps' tour of Zimbabwe next month.

The Greens have produced an e-card and printed thousands of 'Stop the Black Caps' Tour' postcards for distribution at Henry Olonga's public meetings in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland and at the Stop The Tour march in Auckland on Saturday.

"We hope the public will flood Helen with postcards, thanking her Government for stopping the Zimbabwe tour to New Zealand and imploring her to make the Black Caps' tour of Zimbabwe illegal," Green Co-Leader Rod Donald says.

"Opinion polls show that the overwhelming majority of New Zealanders are opposed to the Black Caps' tour of Zimbabwe. This postcard and e-card are an innovative way for Kiwis to give the Government the explicit mandate it feels it needs to stop the tour.

"So far, the Government has lacked the confidence to do the right thing. We're hoping public pressure will lead to the Government matching its tough talk on Zimbabwe with decisive action. There is still time to legislate to stop the tour and get the Black Caps off the hook. The Government needs to listen to the voices of mainstream New Zealanders on this issue."

The e-card is available at: [http://greens.org.nz/campaigns/humanrights/zimbabwe/ecardZimbabwe.asp](http://greens.org.nz/campaigns/humanrights/zimbabwe/ecardZimbabwe.asp)
