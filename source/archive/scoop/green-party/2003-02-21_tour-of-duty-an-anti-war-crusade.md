It is time for students to get active and challenge the system, said Green MP Metiria Turei who launches a nationwide tour of tertiary campuses on Monday.

The Education spokesperson will visit at least 11 campuses over two weeks to coincide with Orientation celebrations as students begin the new tertiary year.

In addition to addressing issues in tertiary education, Metiria will deliver a strong anti-war message and encourage students to engage and challenge the future direction of our country.

"The younger generation are being written off as complacent, or lacking the fire that led to the massive anti-Vietnam and Springbok campaigns," said Metiria. "That's bollocks. Excessive fees and meagre allowances are being used to distract us and we must resist that.

"The Prime Minister has dismissed last week's protests as small because they weren't as big as the Vietnam and Springbok protests. We utterly reject that typically condescending arrogance.

"No more ancient slogans and chants. Let's get creative with our message, let's throw out the traditional rules of protest and spark the fire."

Metiria said she will be meeting with Student Association Executives, Maori and Women's student groups, as well as local greens.

"This is an excellent opportunity to meet with some of the people who will emerge as leaders. I am looking forward to discussing particular issues, such as Te Tiriti and 'user pays', as they relate to education."

The Orientation tour begins Monday, February 24 and concludes on Thursday, March 6.
