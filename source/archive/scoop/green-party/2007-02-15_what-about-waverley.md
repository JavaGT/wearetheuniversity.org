What about Waverley?

Chester Borrows  
National Party MP for Whanganui

What about Waverley?

Labour is trumpeting a $189,000 funding boost for two Wanganui high schools in a cynical attempt to divert attention from the crisis-ridden Waverley High School just 50 kilometres down the road, says the National Party MP for Whanganui, Chester Borrows.

"Now is not the time for Labour MP Jill Pettis to be issuing smug, self-serving releases about education funding when it is clear there are some extremely difficult issues facing my electorate.

"This is an unsubtle attempt to distract people from the Waverley High School disaster.

"The Labour Government has known about the problems at Waverley since 2002 but turned a blind eye.

"Jill Pettis was the local MP from 1996, and claims to have expertise in education, including working in the Ministry of Education's Regional Office in Wanganui before entering Parliament, yet she has never been to a public meeting on the Waverley crisis and obviously failed to act when she was the electorate MP.

"Now we have a school in disarray and a community with children who have missed out on quality education for over four years.

"For some of those students, that is almost their entire secondary schooling.

"If Jill Pettis was serious about quality education, she would put her energy into halting the tragic decline of Waverley High School, not issuing self-serving press releases touting funding allocations for other schools."
