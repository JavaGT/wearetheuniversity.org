**Canterbury University staff cuts short sighted**

The slashing of 150 jobs at the University of Canterbury is academically short sighted and bad for the local economy says the Green Party.

“The University is cutting nearly ten percent of its full time equivalent workforce. Cuts that deep will have a major impact on academic quality and the reputation of the University,” said Green Party tertiary education spokesperson David Clendon.

“Cuts to staff and courses is likely to exacerbate the problem of a declining roll, worsening the University’s financial position further.

“These staff cuts send a message of a University in crisis and decline. Staff and management have been working extremely hard to rebuild and restore the University, to make it even better than it was, and the lack of adequate government support for their efforts must be very disheartening.

“The University is a major contributor the domestic economy, making up around fifteen percent of local GDP. Investing in the University is an investment in Christchurch’s economic rebuild.

“The Government and city council will be spending millions on rebuilding a range of community facilities. The University also needs investment so it can be a central part of the Christchurch of tomorrow.

“These cuts are a blow to the economy now, but also to the role of the University in Christchurch’s future,” said Mr Clendon.
