**Government’s economic agenda on shaky ground**

The Government’s big idea is jobs poor and bad for the environment, said Green Party mining spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

Catherine Delahunty and Green Party energy spokeperson Gareth Hughes spoke at the “Ka Nui! – Enough!” conference held in Rotorua over the weekend about the economic costs and alternatives to the Governments mining agenda.

“The Government’s dig it, drill it, mine it agenda is on shaky ground,” Ms Delahunty said.

“The announcement of grants for risky gas hydrates last week, following the cancelling of an off-shore drilling permit along with a deferment of another, shows the Government is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

“Instead of betting on a boom and bust industry and selling off assets the government needs to invest in a clean energy future.

“Minister of Economic Development Steven Joyce is quick to challenge subsidies of clean technology in the House saying we shouldn’t pick winners but that is exactly what this Government is doing with mining.

“The reality is this Government’s vision for New Zealand is failing, with an 18 year high in unemployment figures.

“The Government doesn't need to resort to risky fossil fuel extraction when we have a wealth of smart green energy opportunities that will deliver real prosperity.

“Mining is not the future for the New Zealand economy; we can create tens of thousands of new, clean technology jobs here at home, if we’re smart,” said Ms Delahunty.
