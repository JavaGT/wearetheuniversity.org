National's tenancy law changes unfair and poorly timed

National's plans to reverse changes to residential tenancy laws show a  
lack of balance and very poor timing.

"It's odd that at a time when more and more people are entering the  
rental property market the Government should decide to remove reforms  
aimed at redressing some of the power imbalance between landlords and  
tenants," Green Party Housing Spokesperson Sue Bradford said.

"For example, Housing Minister Phil Heatley has said that National  
opposes the payment of professional tenant advocates at Tenancy Tribunal  
hearings, will not cap tenant liability for damage that is not their  
fault, and will reverse a change that would have banned real estate  
agents from charging letting fees to tenants.

The Green Party supported all these reforms when Labour announced them  
last year, and it is disappointing that National has decided not to go  
ahead with them when it brings the Residential Tenancies Bill (No 2)  
back to Parliament shortly, Ms Bradford said.

"National talks a lot about fairness and balance, but what's fair about  
removing measures that bring a lot more balance into the system?"

"Who bears financial responsibility for damages can be a contentious  
issue as a group of Dunedin students found out in a case where they were  
all held liable for a kitchen fire accidentally started by only one of  
them.

"Corporate landlords are likely to be represented at Tribunal hearings  
by a tenancy manager advocate who knows the legislation well and is a  
trained professional, while tenants with no knowledge of the law, and  
who often have language or literacy difficulties, have to represent  
themselves.

"This issue affects many New Zealanders as there were 24,297 tenancy  
tribunal hearings held in the 2006/2007 years.

"And many tenants just give up and don't even attend hearings.

"The playing field would be a lot more level if the tenants could access  
professional advocacy help at hearings."
