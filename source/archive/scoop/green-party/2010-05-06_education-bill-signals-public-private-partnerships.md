**Education Bill Signals Public Private Partnerships**

John Key’s Government is softening up New Zealand’s education system for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and privatisation, the Green Party said today.

“The Government wants to impose Public Private Partnerships via school buildings but there is no clear limit to the scope,” Green Education Spokesperson Catherin Delahunty said.

The _Education Amendment Bill_ will have its final reading in Parliament tonight. It allows the Education Secretary to appoint body corporates as managers of schools. The Green Party is the only party opposing the Bill.

“The corporate provisions in the Bill need to be read in the context of National and ACT’s real agenda for education. Bill English has already indicated state schools are part of the PPP experiment,” Ms Delahunty said.

“The Education Minister says PPPs in education have been successful — it would be interesting to see where she is getting her facts from.

“Overseas examples have shown PPPs in education infrastructure cost more to the taxpayer and can create huge debts for schools.

“Students will not benefit from a privatised education system, only the shareholders pockets will.

“Education is a public good. It should not be for profit.

“The Bill introduces the same language the Key Government has used around water, private prisons, ACC and all the other New Zealand assets planned for firesale if National gets a second term,” Ms Delahunty said.
