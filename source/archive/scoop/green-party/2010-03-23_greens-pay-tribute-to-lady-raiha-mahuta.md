**Greens pay tribute to Lady Raiha Mahuta**

The Green Party today honours the work and vision of Lady Raiha Mahuta of Ngati Manu and Ngati Rangi of Nga Puhi who passed away today.

“It was with great sadness that we learnt of Lady Raiha’s passing today. Her commitment to the environment was an inspiration to us all,” said Metiria Turei, Green Party Co-Leader.

  
“I would like to pay tribute to all the work she has done to protect the Waikato River for her people. She was a courageous negotiator on the Waikato River claim, and I know that she will be deeply missed.

“We mourn her passing into the next world, and our prayers and thoughts are with Nanaia and her whanau,” Mrs Turei said.
