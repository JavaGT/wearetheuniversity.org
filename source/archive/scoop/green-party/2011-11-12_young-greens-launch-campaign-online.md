**Young Greens’ launch campaign online**

Green MP Gareth Hughes today hosted the Young Greens’ campaign launch via a live streaming video.

“As the youngest Green MP, I’m stoked to have hosted this event which introduced the Green’s youth candidates,” Mr Hughes said.

“We’ve focused on how the Green’s priorities of rivers, jobs, and kids will make New Zealand a richer place for youth.

“Unemployment and finding a job after study are big issues for New Zealand’s youth. Our Green Jobs Initiative will create 100,000 green jobs and transform New Zealand’s economy.

“We’ve also made it a priority to reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance so that sole parents can access tertiary education and look after their children.

Other issues that were discussed included repealing the voluntary student membership (of Students’ Associations) law, how to keep the internet open, civics education in school, and having a review of how tertiary education providers are funded.

The launch used a combination of the uStream video streaming service and the new Google Plus “hangouts” to bring together Young Green candidates from Auckland to Invercargill.

“We’re using technology to take the democratic process to people our age,” Mr Hughes said.

“Youth are choosing to communicate through the internet and social media so we’re making sure they hear our message.”
