**Green Party extends support for Christchurch**

The Green Party is extending support for the people of Christchurch and Canterbury in the wake of two major earthquakes today.

“2011 has been a tough year for Cantabrians. Our hearts go out to every person in Christchurch and Canterbury today,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.

“Today’s earthquakes are an unwelcome intrusion on the Christmas period when families are coming together after such a challenging year.

“The people of Christchurch have shown great resilience in the face of adversity and the human spirit in the people of Canterbury is indomitable.

“We have seen this human spirit in the past and I have no doubt we will see it over the coming months.

“Our hearts go out to those injured in today’s quakes.

“The Green Party pledges to do all we can to ensure the people of Christchurch and Canterbury receive the help and support they need at this time.

“Our three Christchurch based MPs are ready to offer support to any person who needs or request it.”
