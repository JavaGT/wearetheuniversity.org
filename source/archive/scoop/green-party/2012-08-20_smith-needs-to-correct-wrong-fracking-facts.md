**Smith needs to correct wrong fracking facts**

“National MP Nick Smith is doing a disservice to the national debate on fracking,” said Gareth Hughes Green Party energy spokesperson.

“Nick Smith has been told that he is wrong on his claim hydraulic fracking has been used in New Zealand’s geothermal industry yet he continues to peddle mistruths by not distinguishing between processes that are completely different.

“The New Zealand Geothermal Association has stated that hydraulic fracking has not been used in New Zealand for geothermal energy and there is potential for our geothermal electricity generation to be doubled without any need for hydraulic fracking - contrary to Nick Smith’s claims.

“He needs to correct the opinion piece he has been touting around the country or he is deliberately misleading New Zealanders to promote his Government’s pro-fracking agenda.

“Nick Smith is missing the point, instead of a focus on earthquakes, he should focus on more pressing risks of fracking – especially the potential to irreversibly pollute ground water.

“Contrary to his claims that fracking in the oil and gas industry has occurred without incident – this is not the case,” said Mr Hughes.

There are reports consent breaches and contamination have occurred in Taranaki. In Southland the contaminated waste fracking water has been dumped straight in a local river. In Waikato Solid Energy undertook fracking without permission from the Regional Council.

“Agriculture, the back bone of our economy, depends on clean water which fracking puts at risk,” said Gareth Hughes Green Party MP.

“Given there are so many concerns taking a precautionary approach is wise.

“The New Zealand Government can invest in our massive clean energy potential instead of promoting fracking and risking our brand and environment.”
