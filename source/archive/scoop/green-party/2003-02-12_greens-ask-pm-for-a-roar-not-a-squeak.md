Greens ask PM for a roar, not a squeak

The Green Party is challenging Helen Clark and the Labour Party to return to their anti-war roots and finally send an unequivocal condemnation of America's war plans to the White House.

"This Saturday, the country will witness the biggest peace rallies since the Vietnam War," said Green Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Keith Locke. "Helen Clark and most of her cabinet colleagues were proud to march against aggression in Vietnam. What's changed?

"In those days she would have wanted the anti-war voice of New Zealanders to be heard as loud as possible in the corridors of Washington.

"Later, she and her colleagues in the 4th Labour government marched against nuclear ships and pushed through our anti-nuclear legislation. In those days we were the mouse that roared. Now, we are the mouse that can hardly squeak.

"Through its failure to loudly and clearly convey this country's abhorrence of an unprovoked and massive attack on Iraq, this Labour government is betraying New Zealand's mission as an advocate of peace.

"We appeal to Helen Clark and all the Labour MPs not to stand on the sidelines this Saturday. Join the Green MPs and tens of thousands of New Zealanders in sending a message to Washington: 'No Blood for Oil.'"
