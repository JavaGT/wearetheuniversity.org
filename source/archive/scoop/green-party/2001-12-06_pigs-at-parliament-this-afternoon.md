Pigs At Parliament This Afternoon
=================================

**Thursday, 6 December 2001, 1:29 pm**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Borris the pig and Libby the piglet will be arriving at parliament at 3.30 this afternoon to lobby on behalf of thousands of their peers who are contained in small sow crates up and down the country.

A delegation of junior SPCA members aged between five and 12 will also be presenting Green MP Sue Kedgley with 120 piggy banks - one for each MP - with the message 'We are banking on your support'.

The latest Colmar Brunton poll, released this week, showed 87 per cent of New Zealanders want sow crates banned.

If it rains the reception will be at the top of the steps.

Ends
