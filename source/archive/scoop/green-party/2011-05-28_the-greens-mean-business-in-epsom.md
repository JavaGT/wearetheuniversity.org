The Greens Mean Business in Epsom

The Greens Mean Business in Epsom

David Hay, Green Party candidate for Epsom has welcomed his ACT party rival John Banks to the race in Epsom.

“I will be going after this National and/or Act Party candidate on the issues of climate change and the economy at every opportunity,” says Mr Hay.

“The Act Party’s climate change policy is breathtakingly cynical,” said Mr Hay, “and is increasingly divorced from reason.”

“The voters in Epsom value education, so I am sure they will understand that the scientific question about climate change was settled many years ago. I will put it to them that New Zealand doesn’t need to constantly revisit that issue, we have to do something about it,” said Mr Hay.

A business as usual approach would not solve the climate problem, and it would not improve New Zealand’s economy either, Mr Hay said.

“Don Brash and his Act Party fellow-travellers represent the old guard in economic thinking. Their economic prescriptions are based on an idea of the economy that works beautifully in theory, but in practice is failing to deliver genuine progress. Doing more of the same, or doing it more intensively, will only make things worse,” said Mr Hay.

“What New Zealand needs right now is new ideas and fresh thinking. The Greens are leading the way in parliament on a platform of building a Smart Green Economy. I’ve got one message for the voters in Epsom: the Greens mean business.”

“We are serious about New Zealand taking responsibility for reducing its carbon emissions, and we are serious about leading the change to an economic future that is both successful and sustainable,” said Mr Hay.
