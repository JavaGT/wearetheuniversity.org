**Upcoming zero budget will see more jobless**

The Key Government has failed to deliver on its biggest promise to Kiwi families with employment growing at barely half the rate promised, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.

National’s 2011 Budget forecast employment growth of 36,000 in the year to March 2012 but the latest Household Labourforce Survey (HLFS) figures show that only an additional 20,000 jobs were created.

“On the eve of National’s next Budget, we learn that they have failed to achieve one of the pivotal promises they made last Budget,” said Mrs Turei.

“Kiwi families are fast learning not to rely on the promises of John Key and Bill English.

The HLFS figures show 9,000 more people became unemployed in the March quarter, an increase of 100 per day. Joblessness rose by 12,000, nearly 1,000 per week.

“The sharp increase in unemployment shows the economic policies of this Government are failing to create jobs for New Zealanders,” said Mrs Turei.

“We need a Government that will make an investment in New Zealand families and communities.

“A good first step would be maintaining control of our electricity generating state owned assets that will provide jobs and employment for thousands of New Zealanders.

“We should also be investing in procurement policies that keep jobs in New Zealand.

“Unfortunately the upcoming zero budget is likely see an increase in unemployment and lead to more hardship and inequality in New Zealand.”
