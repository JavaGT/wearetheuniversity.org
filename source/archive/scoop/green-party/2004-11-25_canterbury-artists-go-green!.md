Canterbury artists go green!

Artworks from over 50 of Canterbury's established and emerging artists will go under the hammer at an art auction to be held in the Great Hall of the Arts Centre on Sunday 12 December.

A feature of the auction will be a number of works from the final submissions of graduating fine arts students. Most of these are expected to sell for reasonable prices through a silent auction that commences at 2pm.

Headline artists include Bill Hammond, who has contributed three artist's proofs from his Fish Finder suite of lithographs, Neil Dawson, Llew Summers, Bing Dawe, Tony de Lautour, Diana Adams, Catherine Brough, Rudolf Boelee, Sam Mahon, Siene de Vries, Hannah Kidd, Helen Rockel, Robyne Voyce, Saskia van Voorn, Ross Gray, Gayle Forster, Sandra Thomson, Alan McLean, Wayne Seyb, Mike Glover, Charles Barrington and Chris Pole.

Their works will be available for free viewing from 2.00-5.00pm and will be auctioned by Bryan Andrews from 7.00 pm. The doors open at 6pm for refreshments before the live auction. Evening entry is by ticket only (pre-sales $8, door sales $10 - includes a complementary drink).

Phil and Wendy Norton will provide pre-auction live music. Banks Peninsula Mayor Bob Parker will be the master of ceremonies and the Greens Art Spokesperson and Wearable Art Award winner Mike Ward will be in attendance. Rumour has it he will be wearing this year's entry, titled "Post-Apocalyptic Pacific Troubadour".

Most of the art works can now be viewed on www.thegreatartauction.org.nz

Tickets are available from the Arts Centre Information Centre or the Green Room, 16 Bedford Row, phone 372-1375. Ticket numbers are limited.

'The Great Art Auction' is being organised by the Banks Peninsula branch of the Green Party to raise funds for next year's election campaign.
