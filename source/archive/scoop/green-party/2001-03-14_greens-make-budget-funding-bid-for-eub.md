Greens Make Budget Funding Bid For EUB
======================================

While students around the country protest against the failure of the Government to introduce the Emergency Unemployment Benefit over the summer, the Greens today said they are negotiating with the Government for funding in the current budget round to finally see the EUB reintroduced.

The proposal is the Green Party's largest bid in this budget round. Green Party MP Sue Bradford said the restoration of the EUB was a significant issue for the party.

"After recent statements from the Alliance in support of the EUB we expect to see Jim Anderton use his influence to endorse our proposal when he sits at the table with the Finance Minister to decide the Government's spending priorities," said Ms Bradford.

"It's the least the Alliance should do after voting with Labour to defeat my private member's bill which would have reintroduced the EUB last year," she said.

Ms Bradford congratulated students for the pressure they were bringing on this Government and said she hoped their efforts would not be in vain.

"The outrage from students at the defeat of my bill and their co-ordinated protests such as this national week of action will in the end prove too much for this Government," she predicted.

"In the meantime the Green Party continues to fully support the student body on this issue and will fight along side them for what is only fair," she said.

"The Green Party have consistently walked the walk on this issue and, with our latest budget bid, the pressure is on the Government - and especially the Alliance - to do the same."
