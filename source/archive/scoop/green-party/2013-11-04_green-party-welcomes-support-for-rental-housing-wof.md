**Green Party welcomes Bennett’s support for rental housing warrant of fitness**

The Green Party welcomes Social Development Minister Paula Bennett’s support for a warrant of fitness programme for all private landlords, and are calling on her cabinet colleagues to implement the programme, the Green Party said today.

The Green Party campaigned in 2011 to institute a warrant of fitness programme for all rental accommodation as a key part of its measures to tackle child poverty. Earlier this year the Greens further expanded on this policy in its Home for Life housing announcement.

“The Green Party has long advocated for a warrant of fitness for all rental accommodation, so it is heartening to see the Social Development Minister come out in support of the policy,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

On TVNZ’s Q + A programme this morning, Minister Bennett said that she was an advocate for bringing in a warrant of fitness scheme and extending it out to all private landlords.

“It’s time for Minister Bennett’s fellow National Party colleagues to stop dragging chain and implement this policy which will make a huge difference to the lives of New Zealand children living in poverty,” said Mrs Turei.

“A warrant of fitness programme now has broad cross-party support, with the Labour Party recently coming out in support, and now a National Party Minister.

“This policy is overdue. Substandard rental houses are making our kids sick with debilitating conditions like asthma, rheumatic fever and glue ear.

“A warrant of fitness scheme to ensure warm healthy rentals will make positive change a reality for the hundreds of thousands of children living in cold, inefficient homes,” said Mrs Turei.
