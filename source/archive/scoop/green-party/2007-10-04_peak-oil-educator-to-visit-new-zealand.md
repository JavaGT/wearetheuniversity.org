Peak oil educator to visit New Zealand

Richard Heinberg, one of the world's foremost Peak Oil educators and Research Fellow of Post Carbon Institute, is coming to New Zealand in October hosted by the Green Party and the Eco Show to give talks in Auckland, Wellington and Taupo.

"The end of cheap oil is a problem the world will have to face, and I am honoured to be able to host Richard Heinberg here at Parliament for a briefing to all MPs on this topic," Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says.

He is the author of eight books including The Party's Over: Oil, War and the Fate of Industrial Societies (2003), Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World (2004), and The Oil Depletion Protocol (2006). He is also a journalist, educator, editor, lecturer, and a Core Faculty member of New College of California where he teaches a programme on "Culture, Ecology and Sustainable Community". Since 2002, he has given over 300 lectures on Peak Oil to a wide variety of audiences—from insurance executives to peace activists, from local and national elected officials to Jesuit volunteers.

Richard Heinberg appears prominently in the film The End of Suburbia, which has been widely screened in New Zealand, as well as contributing to more recent documentaries such as; 11 th Hour, Crude Impact and Oil, Smoke & Mirrors.
