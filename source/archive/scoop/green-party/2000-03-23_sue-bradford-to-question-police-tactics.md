Sue Bradford To Question Police Tactics
=======================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Sue Bradford To Question Police Tactics

Green MP Sue Bradford will today question new police methods of dealing with demonstrators during question time this afternoon.

Ms Bradford's question will be around the same time as students from Hamilton protest against WINZ and their handling of student finances. The question and the letter to demonstrating students are attached.

Question for Oral Answer: My question is to the Minister of Police and asks, What is the Government's policy in relation to nose holds, choke holds and similar tactics in dealing with people on demonstrations?

To Fightback Waikato

Congratulations and very best wishes for your demonstration this afternoon. I hope your protest is constructive and peaceful and that police do not resort to the brutal methods as were employed in Auckland last week.

I will be asking a question in Parliament this afternoon to ascertain whether the Government supports these tactics against demonstrators or not. I have included this question and will forward the Government's answer as soon as I receive it.

The Green Party supports your call for Christine Rankin to be sacked and for a complete overhaul of WINZ, in the way it treats both students and beneficiaries.

Yours in solidarity

Sue Bradford Green Party MP
