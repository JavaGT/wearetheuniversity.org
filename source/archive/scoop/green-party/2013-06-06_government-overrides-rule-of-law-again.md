**Government overrides rule of law again**

National’s undemocratic law making is in the spotlight again with the Law Society slamming the constitutionality of new housing legislation, calling it _‘contrary to the rule of law and good legislation principles’_.

“National has a loose relationship with democratic law making. Their Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Bill is just the latest in a series of new laws that are deeply undemocratic,” said Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman.

“The criticism by the Law Society of National’s housing law comes on the heels of constitutional lawyer Stephen Frank’s criticisms of the legality of the SkyCity deal and leading experts criticisms of law making removing rights of family careers, protestors at sea and the removal of local democracy in Canterbury.

“National is riding roughshod over good law making in order to pass legislation that favours their backers.

“Under the new housing law the Minister can set up special housing areas without going through any basic consultation or resource consent processes.

“The main financial benefactors of this specific law will be National’s backers, property developers, who won’t have to go through normal building consent processes. That is crony capitalism.

“This is law making to fast track profits for National’s mates. The leaky buildings disaster should be warning enough about the dangers of lax regulations and rules in the building industry.

“This type of undemocratic law making is called a Henry VIII law. It is law by decree and it staggering that it is such a key part of National’s law making given we are supposed to be a modern democracy.

“The Government should listen to the Law Society when they say clause 88 of the housing Bill is undesirable and should be removed.”
