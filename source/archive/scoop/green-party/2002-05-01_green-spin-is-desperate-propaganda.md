Green Spin Is Desperate Propaganda
==================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Clearly the Greens have closed their minds to scientific analysis, something that is entirely consistent with their science free New Zealand approach, ACT Environment Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff said today.

"The Green Party's spin on the results of honest science at Otago University is simply desperate propaganda and an attempt to support what are extravagant claims by the organic food industry.

"The Otago Study confirms the results of other studies overseas and the conclusions of the Advertising Standards Authority of UK that organic food is objectively the same in nutrition and taste.

"One positive for the organic food industry from the Otago study was that organic food was also microbiologically indistinguishable from conventional produce. Some commentators had speculated that due to greater insect damage the opportunity for attack by fungi and other microbes was greater in organic foodstuffs. This was shown in the Otago study to be an assumption not supported by the facts.

"Diane Bourn and her team of scientists should be congratulated for their service to consumers and not have their words twisted and selectively quoted for political purposes by self-interested parties like Ian Ewen-Street," Gerry Eckhoff said.
