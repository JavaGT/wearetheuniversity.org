Canterbury’s future needs community input
=========================================

**Canterbury’s future needs community input**

The local community must be consulted on the rebuilding of Christchurch and its surrounding areas, Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman said today.

Many buildings important to Canterbury’s heritage and local communities were damaged in Saturday’s earthquake and some have since been torn down.

“The Government has responded well so far to the events of Saturday,” said Dr Norman.

“At present, making certain the traumatised population of Christchurch and its surrounding satellite towns are cared for is obviously the number one priority.

“However, looking ahead, Christchurch’s population need the chance to have input into what a post-quake Christchurch will look and feel like.

“This will mean - where possible - preserving iconic buildings important to local communities and building new urban structures that will complement Christchurch’s unique character.

“Decisions made in the next few weeks will shape the future of Christchurch for generations to come,” said Dr Norman.

“We are looking forward to working with the Government on developing a rebuilding strategy and ensuring that Cantabrians have full opportunity to contribute to that strategy.”

Christchurch-based Green Party MP Kennedy Graham is today visiting welfare centres.

Dr Graham yesterday told Parliament that there is an opportunity to ensure that any re-building programme reflects the very in sustainable building design and construction.
