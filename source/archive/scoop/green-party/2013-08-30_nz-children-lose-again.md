NZ children lose again

Today’s decision by the Court of Appeal dismissing an appeal by the Child Poverty Action Group condemns children whose parents are without employment to on-going poverty, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.

The Court of Appeal has dismissed an appeal by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) challenging part of the Working for Families package introduced in 2004.

“The in-work tax credit (IWTC) has lifted thousands of children out of poverty but hasn’t helped the one in five children whose parents study or are on a benefit,” said Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei.

“Children deserve better treatment in the law and in policy than this decision gives them.

“I am very disappointed. CPAG have been unrelenting advocates for children and we support them 100 per cent.

“While the courts may think the discriminatory impact of the on-benefit rule it is not out of proportion to the goal of incentivising people into work. We don’t,” Mrs Tūrei said.

“We would extend the in -work tax credits to the children of beneficiary and student families.

“234,000 Kiwi kids live in families supported by a benefit and don't get the IWTC. The IWTC would deliver an extra $60 a week for our poorest families with 1 to 3 children, and $90 a week for those with 4 children or more.

“We will continue to campaign against discrimination and for equity for children and their families regardless of today’s decision by the Court of Appeal, said Mrs Turei.

“We will put children at the heart of politics, not on the periphery.
