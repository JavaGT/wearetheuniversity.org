Green Party MPs Catherine Delahunty and Steffan Browning not seeking re-election

Green Party MPs Catherine Delahunty and Steffan Browning are announcing today that they will not seek re-election in 2017.

Both Ms Delahunty and Mr Browning will continue in their roles as Green Party MPs until the election.

“I’m very proud of my eight years as a Green Party MP, and the many, many years I spent before that as an activist fighting for women, our environment, and the rights of tangata whenua,” said Ms Delahunty, who holds the water, education and te Tiriti o Waitangi portfolios.

“It has been an honour to represent the Green Party and our supporters in Parliament.

“I feel particularly proud of the work I’ve done around building a quality, more inclusive public education system, leading our Party’s nationwide campaign for swimmable rivers, speaking up for the people of West Papua, and working for a national register of contaminated toxic sites.

“I intend on spending the coming months campaigning hard on these issues, which I know many thousands of New Zealanders care deeply about.

“After that, I am looking forward to continuing my lifelong commitment to activism and community building, as well as spending more time writing and being with my family,” said Ms Delahunty.

Mr Browning, who was elected to Parliament in 2011 and holds the pesticides, organics and food safety portfolios, among others, says he is pleased to have played his part in advocating for change.

“Holding the organics portfolio has meant that I’ve been working alongside some of the most innovative New Zealanders, who are creating a more sustainable future for our country, today,” said Mr Browning.

“Another personal highlight was my Spray Free Streets and Parks campaign. It’s really struck a chord with communities around the country who want a pesticide-free future for their kids.

“I’m also thrilled that just last week my Consumers Right to Know Member’s Bill was pulled from the ballot. New Zealanders should have the right to know where their food is from and how it’s produced – and, if it passes, it’ll be great for our local growers and suppliers too.

“I’ll be continuing to work hard on those kinds of issues, and more, after I finish up my time as an MP,” said Mr Browning.
