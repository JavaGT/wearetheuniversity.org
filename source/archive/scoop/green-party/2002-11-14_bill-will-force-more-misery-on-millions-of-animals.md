Bill will force more misery on millions of animals

Green MP Sue Kedgley today said a new Government bill being introduced into Parliament today would delay any moves to phase out sow crates and battery cages by at least another year and she urged all MPs from all parties to vote with their hearts and defeat the bill.

The Government's Animal Welfare Amendment Bill delays by at least a year, and potentially indefinitely, the implementation of revised animal welfare codes for animals like pigs and chickens.

It could potentially delay indefinitely the need for a review of codes of animal welfare.

"The bill is an outrage, and a slap in the face for all of those New Zealanders who have made submissions on these animal welfare codes," said Ms Kedgley.

"Far from being a purely technical bill, as it purports to be, the changes will have far reaching implications for the welfare of animals in New Zealand.

"It could mean that millions of animals in New Zealand will continue to suffer miserably in cages and other cruel devices for many years to come."

Ms Kedgley said there was no excuse for the delays proposed in the bill.

"I don't accept that the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee couldn't manage to get these codes ready for implementation in the three years they have already had."

Ms Kedgley said consumers and the public - and the tens of thousands of New Zealanders who have made submissions opposing the use of battery cages and sow crates - would be furious that Government was ignoring their views in favour of old fashioned industries which were resisting change.

"Sooner or later the Government and industry are going to have to bite the bullet and face the fact that New Zealanders want an end to animal cruelty. It is just a shame that this Government thinks it acceptable for business to profit from the extended suffering of millions of animals," said Ms Kedgley.

Sue will be speaking on this bill this afternoon in parliament.
