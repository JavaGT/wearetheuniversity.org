Greens Launch Orientation Tour Of NZ Campuses

Green MPs Nandor Tanczos and Metiria Turei will spend the next two weeks speaking and partying with students on campuses up and down the country.

Nandor and Meyt start their two-week, eight-city Orientation Tour in Wellington on Monday.

“Students know that tertiary education is not just an election year issue for the Greens,” Nandor, Green Tertiary Education Spokesperson said. “As the only party which has consistently spoken out about the concerns of students for the past five years, we’re looking to get input back from students about how we’re doing.

“I am looking forward to meeting as many students as possible so I make sure the Party is still on point.”

Nandor said he was expecting tertiary education to be a huge election issue this year.

“This Government has tinkered but we know that New Zealand can do better. The Greens will campaign alongside students to keep the pressure on for a universal student allowance, an emergency unemployment benefit over summer, and a cap on student fees.”

Meyt said she was expecting the two-week tour to be a lot of fun.

“It is crucial to have a philosophy of life as you travel through your future. For me it is very simple: there is no point doing anything if you’re not going to have a good time and fuck some shit up in the process.”
