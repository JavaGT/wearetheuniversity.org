150 years of Parliament: Is this as good as it gets?

As Parliamentarians polish their speeches and prepare their palates to celebrate 150 years of representative democracy in New Zealand, the Green Party is inviting the public to come along to a seminar on where we might go over the next 150 years.

Rather than dwelling on the past, speakers at the "Democracy: Is this as good as it gets?" seminar will explore a variety of future possibilities, including Te Tiriti, anarchist, republican and gender-equal models.

"Maybe this is as good as it gets," said host and Green List MP, Metiria Turei. "But I personally hope our democracy will evolve in a way that delivers a lot better for all those marginalized people who don't get a great deal out of the present system.

"Any successes achieved by parliaments over the last 150 years shouldn't blind us to the injustices. Only by an honest appraisal of what's gone before can we adequately plan for what comes next. Rather than just back-slapping each other over a job well done, politicians owe it to the people to ask how we can all create a just and peaceful society."

Metiria said entry to the seminar was free.

"We're hoping all sorts will turn up: students, businesspeople, media, even the odd non-Green MP. Like Parliament, everyone will get a chair and a chance to participate in question-time but, unlike the House, you won't need a big advertising budget or a safe seat to get in the door."

Theme: "Democracy: Is this as good as it gets?" Time: 5:30-7:30pm Monday 24th May. Place: National Portrait Gallery, Ground Floor, Bowen House, Wellington.
