Steve Irwin's death a loss to environment movement

Green Party Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei expressed her shock and dismay at the accidental death yesterday of Australian wildlife champion Steve Irwin.

"Like many thousands of New Zealanders I'd come to expect that Steve Irwin could take on the most daring and spectacular feats, while seemingly invulnerable to harm. A large part of what lent him that aura of invincibility was his passionate love for the creatures of the wild, and his respect for the dangers they can pose to the unwary. Typically, it was a freak accident - and not any carelessness on his part - that led to this tragic outcome.

"I think the environmental movement always needs people like Steve Irwin, who always seemed so much larger than life. Personalities like Steve Irwin manage to communicate their love of the outdoors to millions of people who might not otherwise be so receptive to messages of conservation," Mrs Turei says.

"Our thoughts are with Steve Irwin's family at this sad time. The environmental movement has lost one of its most colourful and effective leaders."
