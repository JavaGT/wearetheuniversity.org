Philip Morris Should Butt Out Of Efforts To Reduce Smoking

**Philip Morris Should Butt Out Of Efforts To Reduce Smoking**

Philip Morris knows its product kills New Zealanders but is pushing addicts to pressure the Government to drop measures which would make it harder to smoke.

The Government is proposing a series of tax hikes which will mean a pack of cigarettes will cost $20 by 2016. It is also considering plain packaging.

“Today’s revelation that Philip Morris has set up a website and is trying to get smokers to make submissions is disturbing,” said Green Party health spokesperson Kevin Hague.

“It is immoral for a company that knows its product is lethal to actively urge smokers to soften attempts to save lives.

“Around 5000 New Zealanders die every year due to smoking and second-hand smoke and half of long-term smokers die of a related illness.

“Tobacco companies spend enough money on lobbying without stooping to try and enlist the people they are killing.”

From Monday tobacco displays have to be removed from shops.

Despite arguments during hearings on that change research released today shows that retailers are not overly concerned. The University of Otago, research found most retailers were relaxed about the change.

Many retailers felt ambivalent about selling tobacco and would rather not sell it.

Previous research they did found that 65% of a sample of over 1300 smokers agreed with the statement 'tobacco companies should be more tightly regulated’”.
