National Brings Back Junk Food, say Greens

Green MP Health spokesperson Sue Kedgley says she is astounded that the National Party has scrapped a requirement that schools sell healthy food, and is giving schools the green light to start selling junk food again.

\"It is an astonishingly stupid move which will cost the nation dearly," Ms Kedgley said. The government announced today it was scrapping the National Administration Guidelines requiring schools to sell only healthy food. Ms Kedgley said anecdotal evidence showed that the new school food guidelines were working well and most schools were changing their tuck shop menus to encourage healthy eating. "Just as real progress is being made, the Government removes the incentive for schools to promote healthy eating and there is now nothing to stop schools from selling cheap junk food to students. "Poor diet is the leading cause of premature death and disease in New Zealand, the Government knows this only too well - a third of our kids are obese or overweight. Why on earth would it scrap a programme designed to tackle the looming epidemics in obesity-related illness and make sure our kids have healthy habits modelled at school?"

Ms Kedgley said it was well established that diet affects children's behaviour and their ability to learn and concentrate in class. "Many teachers report that when children eat healthy food, they are better able to concentrate in class, and are therefore able to learn better."

"Kids who are loaded with sugar and fat, or caffeine and colouring often struggle to concentrate. Why wouldn't the Government want our schools to offer the best possible learning environment to our children?" Ms Kedgley asked.

Ms Kedgley said the Green Party had surveyed school tuck shops for over the last five years, and the surveys demonstrated that until the school food guidelines were given regulatory force, a majority of school canteens dragged their feet and continued to sell a staple diet of unhealthy food. "Schools were not making the change voluntarily, which is precisely why the National Administrative Guidelines were amended to make it a requirement sell healthy food. "If we are to improve the health and well-being of New Zealanders, it's essential we start with children, teach them good eating habits and encourage them to make healthy food choices," said Ms Kedgley.
