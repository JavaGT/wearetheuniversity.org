WINZ Error Bad Omen for Students - Greens

WINZ Error Bad Omen for Students - Greens

A WINZ computer error which sent incorrect loan forms to 22,000 students is a bad omen for students, Green Party tertiary education spokesperson Michael Tritt said today.

The error has led to incorrect enrolment details appearing on the student loan contracts. The Aotearoa Post-Compulsory Student Union said today the most common mistake was showing students who have enrolled at North Island universities as having enrolled at Canterbury University.

"This error is extremely worrying as it shows that WINZ is still exhibiting the bureaucratic incompetence which caused so much stress and hardship for students last year," Mr Tritt said.

Mr Tritt said the error would cause confusion and anxiety to the 22,000 students, and would trigger an influx of phone calls to WINZ.

"I am concerned about the students affected by this mistake, but I am more concerned that it could be a sign of worse things to come," Mr Tritt said.

"Students have not forgotten the payment delays which caused many to resort to foodbanks, and some to face threats of eviction from rental properties."

"I call upon social services minister Steve Maharey, who was a prominent critic of WINZ last year, to ensure that there is no further repeat of the errors and delays that WINZ has become infamous for," Mr Tritt concluded. ends
