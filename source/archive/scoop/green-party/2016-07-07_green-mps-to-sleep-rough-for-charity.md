**Green MPs to sleep rough for charity**

**What:** Green Party MPs will take part in the Lifewise Big Sleep Out, raising awareness and money to address homelessness.

**Where:** AUT University Quad, Wellesley Street East, Auckland CBD.

**Who:** Green Party Co-leader James Shaw and MPs Marama Davidson, Jan Logie, and Denise Roche.

Green Party MPs will sleep rough in Auckland tonight as part of the [Lifewise Big Sleep Out](http://bigsleepout.org.nz/).

“Homelessness is a very serious problem, but the number of people taking part in the Big Sleep Out this year shows that Kiwis really do care, and we want to fix that problem,” Green Party Co-leader James Shaw said.

“Lifewise and other organisations do fantastic work on the frontline of the housing crisis, and they deserve our support,” said Mr Shaw.

The Green Party and the Labour Party yesterday launched a joint inquiry into homelessness, following a refusal by the National Government to initiate a cross-party inquiry.

“When one in a hundred New Zealanders are homeless or living in overcrowded conditions, we have a responsibility to step up and do everything we can to turn that around,” said Green MP Marama Davidson.

“That’s why we have launched an inquiry with the Labour Party to get to the bottom of what’s caused the explosion in homelessness, and to figure out the best ways we can fix the problem.

“National is missing in action when it comes to homelessness, but with political leadership and co-operation we can work towards getting our people off the streets, and into safe, secure housing,” said Ms Davidson.
