Green MP Gareth Hughes will be launching a new Member’s Bill today, which is aimed at helping people with student loans get into their first homes.

“Home ownership is part of the Kiwi dream but is increasingly out of reach for many young people. My Bill is one step in the right direction,” said Green Party tertiary spokesperson Gareth Hughes.

“The Government has made it harder for graduates to get into their first home by failing to act quickly to stop the housing crisis.

“My new Bill is one of the many solutions that the Green Party are working on to end the housing crisis and ensure that everyone in New Zealand can live in warm, dry and secure homes,” said Mr Hughes.

The Green Party will also be unveiling an online tool to help people understand how this Bill can help them save for a home.
