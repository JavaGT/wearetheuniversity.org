Easter Of Hope For Battery Hens
===============================

28 March 2002

Green MP Sue Kedgley today said she was delighted with news that the Minister of Agriculture's offices are being swamped with submissions from members of the public demanding an end to the use of battery cages in egg production.

In response to questions from Ms Kedgley in parliament today Jim Sutton said his office had already received around 5000 submissions from the public demanding an end to the use of battery cages in the two weeks following the launch of the SPCA campaign on March 14.

"I am delighted that at a time when images of happy fluffy yellow chicks are being paraded everywhere, the public of New Zealand is increasingly becoming aware of the truth of battery farming.

"Five thousand submissions in just two weeks is the tip of the iceberg and by the end of this campaign I confidently predict well over 100,000 submissions will have been received," she said.

Ms Kedgley said the views of the public had to be respected and reflected in recommendations back to the Minister.

Ms Kedgley said she was planning a cross-party tour of MPs to visit organic, free range, barn and battery hen farms and she was pleased that Jim Sutton seemed agreeable to such a visit.

"This is an Easter of hope. The tide is turning on the battery cage and if this campaign continues to gather steam at this rate then, in the not to distant future, the cute chicks we see promoted at Easter every year will live significantly better lives than their poor battery peers."
