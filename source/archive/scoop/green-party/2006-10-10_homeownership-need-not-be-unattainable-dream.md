Homeownership need not be an unattainable Kiwi dream

There are ways and means of getting more low-income New Zealanders into their first homes, but this Government is lacking the nerve and vision to do so, the Green Party says.

Housing Spokesperson Sue Bradford says she was disappointed, but not surprised, to hear the most recent figures from Massey University showing that New Zealand's housing affordability was at an all time low.

"It's totally unacceptable that our Government is allowing the gap between the haves and the have nots to grow further and further apart.

"Increasing numbers of people all over the country have no hope of ever living the New Zealand dream of owning their own home and this is not good enough.

"I believe the Government should be more innovative when it comes to implementing new ways of getting people into their first homes.

"For example Housing New Zealand Corporation should be willing to take more risks in finding community-based housing organisations who can provide affordable homes to low income people - sometimes through unconventional means.

"The Housing Innovation Fund should be expanded to increased funding for third sector housing initiatives, not limited to a capped system as at present.

"Housing New Zealand could also be playing a much bigger part making a much bigger investment in rental properties. At the moment there are people all over the country in absolutely desperate need of rental housing," Ms Bradford says.

"With just a little more vision and a lot more courage this Government could be helping many more Kiwis into home ownership and ensuring them a more secure future."
