Greens urge big turn-out for peace

The Green Party's nine MPs are urging concerned New Zealanders to join them on Saturday at the wave of peace rallies being held around the country to voice opposition to Bush's War for Oil.

"There is absolutely no legal or moral justification for an American invasion of Iraq," said Green Co-leader, Jeanette Fitzsimons. "It is very important that people turn out on Saturday to send a message both to the White House and to the Beehive.

"We're pleased that Helen Clark has so far resisted pressure to join Bush's 'coalition of the willing' but we're concerned that she has so far refused to convey to Washington this country's condemnation.

"In fact, we're alarmed that she is sending a very different message to the White House by committing our navy and air force to effectively support a US invasion under the guise of 'searching' for al Qaeda agents in the Gulf of Hormuz.

"I'm heartened that the Prime Minister has given Labour MPs permission to join the rallies. It would be encouraging to hear some other voices in Parliament raised in favour of peace."

The New Zealand rallies are part of the International Day of Action Against the War, with millions expected to take to the streets world-wide.

The Green MPs will be speaking at the following rallies on Saturday:

Wellington: Keith Locke and Sue Kedgley (March starts at midday from Glover Park.) Auckland: Jeanette Fitzsimons (Midday, QEII Square.) Hamilton: Nandor Tanczos (Midday, Garden Place.) Rotorua: Metiria Turei (Midday, City Focus.) Nelson: Mike Ward and Ian Ewen-Street (11am, Wakatu Park.) Christchurch: Rod Donald (1pm, Victoria Square.) Dunedin: Sue Bradford (11.45, Museum; 12.30, Octagon.)
