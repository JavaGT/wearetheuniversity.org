**NZ Govt needs to call for Israel to halt air strikes**

The New Zealand Government must push for Israel to stop its campaign of terror in Gaza, the Green Party said today.

Thousands of civilians in Gaza have fled their homes as Israel has continued an offensive to destroy Hamas rocket sites located in Gaza. The Israeli offensive has killed at least 160 people according to Palestinian officials.

“Israel has ignored calls from the United Nations for restraint leading to huge numbers of civilian casualties in Gaza,” Green Party MP Dr Kennedy Graham said today.

“Both Israel and Hamas have violated international law with their targeting of civilians and both deserve condemnation.

“However Israel’s vastly superior firepower and rocket defence systems mean Israel has been able to inflict devastation in the Gaza strip while protecting its own citizens.

“The New Zealand Government can’t just ignore the situation in Gaza,” Dr Graham said.

“As every day goes by more innocent civilians will become collateral damage.

“Israel needs to recognise that it is part of the international community and must begin to abide by United Nations’ resolutions that it continues to flout.
