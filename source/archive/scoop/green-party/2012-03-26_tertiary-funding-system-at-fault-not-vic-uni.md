Tertiary funding system at fault, not Vic Uni

**Tertiary funding system at fault, not Vic Uni**

Accusations that Victoria University “rorts” the government’s tertiary education funding system highlight the model’s poor design and inadequacies, the Green Party says.

Green Party tertiary education spokesperson David Clendon said the Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) was a poorly designed model for funding.

“The funding model imposes high compliance costs and inappropriately influences decisions that should be driven by academic rather than financial considerations, such appointments and programme decisions,” said Mr Clendon.

A summary report prepared by Bruce Corkill QC found no evidence to support assertions of dishonest or unethical behaviour at Victoria University.

“However, Bruce Corkill’s report does highlight the lack of transparency and trust in the process,” Mr Clendon said.

“As it is, the system places unnecessary stresses on our tertiary education institutions, forcing them into difficult positions.

“The PBRF model encourages excessive weighting on research records compared to other important qualities such as teaching ability and student engagement.

“The PBRF is heavily biased toward international publication, no matter how esoteric or narrowly focused, and disadvantages researchers focusing on New Zealand issues and challenges.

“We need to return to a more balanced and transparent funding model that would gain the confidence of everyone involved in the tertiary sector,” Mr Clendon said.
