Meeting to discuss sustainable energy solutions
===============================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Public meeting to discuss sustainable energy solutions

Green Party Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons will address a public meeting tonight to discuss the energy crisis, the reasons behind it and how future crises can be avoided.

Ms Fitzsimons, a former Auckland University lecturer in energy planning and publisher of numerous energy articles since late the 1970s, said the energy crisis should not be a surprise after decades of unsustainable energy policies and practices and a culture of electricity waste.

Recent Government announcements to ensure reserve power generation won't go far enough to avoid future energy crises, said Ms Fitzsimons.

"Electricity demand grew at five percent in the last year. If that keeps up we have to double to whole system in just 14 years and then quadruple it in 28. No rate if building new supply can keep up with that.

"We need a 'power shift' from fossil fuels to renewables, from waste to conservation and from profit seeking to the common good."

  
What: Public Meeting: 'Why do we have an electricity crisis - and what should we do about it?'

When: Thursday, 5 June. 7.30pm

Where: Our City Cnr Oxford Terrace and Worcester Street.
