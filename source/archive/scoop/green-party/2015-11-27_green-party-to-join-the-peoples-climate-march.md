**Green Party to join the People’s Climate March**

The Green Party will be out in force this weekend, as MPs, celebrities and supporters join the Green Bloc to march in solidarity with thousands of Kiwis taking to the streets to demand action on climate change.

Across New Zealand, people from all walks of life will take to the streets, led by a coalition of humanitarian organisations, environment groups, trade unions and faith groups.

Tens of thousands of Kiwis are expected to join marches throughout the country on Saturday and Sunday, part of the world-wide People’s Climate March, which could prove to be the world’s largest climate mobilisation.

Green Party Co-leader James Shaw and MP Kennedy Graham will attend the march in Auckland on Saturday along with other Green MPs, TV and sporting personality Hayley Holt, and supporters, before leaving for the UN climate change summit in Paris.

“Thousands of people will be taking to the streets with us on the weekend, because they believe that the things they love are worth saving,” Mr Shaw said.

Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei will be marching in Dunedin on Sunday.

“Climate change is the most important issue of our time, and together we’ll be standing up for our families’ future and for an economy that works for people and the planet,” Mrs Turei said.

Mr Shaw will be representing New Zealanders at Paris as part of the official Government delegation, and Dr Graham and Green MP Julie Anne Genter will be attending as observers.

“Paris is the best chance we’ve got right now to secure a good climate deal,” Mr Shaw said.

“If a strong agreement is reached in Paris, it will genuinely change our children’s and grandchildren’s futures for the better.

“Thousands of New Zealanders have already called on the Government to back a climate plan that our country can be proud of.

“This weekend we’ll be making that call loud and clear in solidarity with hundreds of thousands of voices around the world. It’ll be up to the Government to show the world that they’ve heard it,” Mr Shaw said.
