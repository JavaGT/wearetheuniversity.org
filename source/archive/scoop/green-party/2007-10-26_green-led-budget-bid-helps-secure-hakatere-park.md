Green-led Budget bid helps secure conservation park

The Green Party is thrilled to have been integral in the formation of Hakatere Conservation Park.

“The Hakatere Conservation Park is the best remaining high country wetland complex in New Zealand. Its premium braided river habitats are outstanding examples of fresh water ecology,” Conservation Spokesperson Metiria Turei says.

“The Upper Rangitata is one of the few braided river habitats left in New Zealand which is largely free of invasive weeds and we are thrilled this will be protected.

“A Budget bid secured by the Greens has increased funding for the park’s management more than 10-fold.

“We are especially pleased with the conservation park, as it is a good way to raise awareness of the range of values that this wetland provides - at a time when wetlands are being drained for farms and other development. Only 45,600 hectares of wetland remain in this country.

“The area is of significant value to the mana whenua, as a mahinga kai area.

“The Green Party is focussed on ensuring that its Budget bids provide significant long-term, sustainable benefit to New Zealand. The park is a wonderful example of this and we appreciate Conservation Minister Chris Carter’s support.

“This new conservation park is easily accessible to thousands of New Zealanders. The lakes provide for fishing, windsurfing, kayaking and swimming. I hope many people take the opportunity to visit the park, walk and enjoy its beauty,” Mrs Turei says.
