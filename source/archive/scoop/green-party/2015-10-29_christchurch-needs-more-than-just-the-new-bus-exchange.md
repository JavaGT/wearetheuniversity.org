Christchurch needs more than just the new Bus Exchange

**Christchurch needs more than just the new Bus Exchange**

  
Christchurch deserves a co-ordinated transport agency with a region-wide plan, not just the new Bus Exchange that Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee is visiting today, said the Green Party.

“The National Government is tinkering around the edges when it comes to public transport, but what we need is a coordinated regional transport agency that’s able to make smart planning decisions for all the people who live and work in Canterbury,” Green Party Christchurch spokesperson Eugenie Sage said.

“The Green Party [has a plan](https://www.greens.org.nz/policy/smarter-economy/greener-christchurch) to get Christchurch and Canterbury moving with a single organisation, responsible for transport strategy, planning, and service delivery.

“The new Bus Exchange has been a great addition to the central city, but we need a step change to improve transport options and reduce traffic congestion.

“Cantabrians make more than 14 million public transport trips every year, but the public transport system is underfunded.

“Traffic congestion in greater Christchurch increased 40 percent from 2009 to 2013 and is predicted to increase further. Without a co-ordinated approach to transport planning for all Canterbury, we run the risk of gridlock and traffic hassles becoming all too frequent.

“Auckland Transport has been transformational in getting Auckland moving in a coordinated way, and shows why we need a similar Canterbury Transport agency,” said Ms Sage.
