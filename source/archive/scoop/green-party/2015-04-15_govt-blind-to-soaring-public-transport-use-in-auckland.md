**Govt blind to soaring public transport use in Auckland**

The Government should take note of huge increases in Auckland’s public transport patronage figures released today by Auckland Transport and bring forward funding for the City Rail Link, the Green Party said.

“The Government should stop delaying and fund the City Rail Link immediately,” Green Party transport spokesperson Julie Anne Genter said.

“The Green Party will be looking for significant increases in public transport infrastructure investment in Budget 2015. Anything less is short-changing hundreds of thousands of commuters.

“At the current rate, Auckland will reach the patronage target needed for Government City Rail Link funding three years ahead of schedule in 2017.

“The Government is forcing Aucklanders to wait for vital infrastructure investment even though public transport patronage figures show that there’s a clear need for immediate investment.

“There were a million more public transport boardings in March 2015 than in March 2014 in Auckland. This kind of growth means investment in public transport infrastructure must begin straight away.

“The National Government is too busy with one lane bridges and expensive motorway projects to realise that the best way to get cities moving efficiently is investing in public transport.

“Rail patronage in Auckland set a new record in March 2015 – 1.56 million trips – and so did bus patronage and trips on the Northern Busway. The Government needs to show that it’s taking notice,” said Ms Genter.
