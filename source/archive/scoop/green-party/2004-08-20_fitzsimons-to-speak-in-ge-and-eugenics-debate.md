Fitzsimons to speak in GE and eugenics debate

Green Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons will be taking in part in a public debate next week on GE and Eugenics.

'GE Babies: Eugenics or Utopia?' is part of The 6 O'clock Views series hosted by Victoria University's Continuing Education Centre and is presented in association with Victoria's Disability Support Services.

Science is on the threshold of new radical technologies capable of preventing many genetic impairments. Are parents morally obliged to make use of these technologies? Or do 'designer' babies reflect deep-seated prejudices against people with impairments?

Other speakers will be - Jess Hammond, moral philosopher; John Forman, Executive Director, NZ Organisation for Rare Disorders and Paul Gibson, National Policy Adviser, CCS. Mike Gourley, broadcaster, educator and disability rights activist will chair the debate.

When: 6pm-7.30pm, Tuesday 24 August.

Where: Lecture Theatre 1, Ground Floor, Rutherford House, 23 Lambton Quay, Wellington (tower block by bus station opposite Parliament, between the High Court and the Railway Station). Debate enquiries to Victoria Continuing Education, 04 463 6556, conted@vuw.ac.nz.
