**Thanks Student Volunteer Army**

The Green Party thanked the Student Volunteer Army in Christchurch today, as the army wound down major operations.

Organised by Canterbury students, the student army recruited hundreds of volunteers to shovel liquifacted soil, leaflet, and door knock in areas badly affected by Christchurch’s devastating earthquake.

“The Canterbury student union deserves a medal for the efforts of the army,” said Green Party Tertiary Education spokesperson Gareth Hughes.

“They have shown exceptional leadership and community spirit.”

The army also enlisted squadrons, made up of three to five people who had their own transport and equipment, and then assigned them jobs.

Green Party MP Kennedy Graham and volunteers formed a squadron this week and went door knocking in Parklands and other suburbs. They were able to reach out to many vulnerable and isolated residents, some of whom said that the humanitarian visit was the first they had received.

“On behalf of the Green Party, I thank the student volunteer army for the tremendous job they have done, and the hope they have inspired,” said Mr Hughes.

To mark the end of their major operations, comedians and musicians will descend on UCSA carpark this afternoon.
