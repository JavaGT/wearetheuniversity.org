**Government hands out cash to wealthy school while Christchurch suffers**

The Government’s decision to more than triple the amount of money it gives to newly integrated Wanganui Collegiate while closing schools in Christchurch is yet another example of it privileging the privileged while everyday New Zealanders suffer, the Green Party said today.

“Hekia Parata is claiming demographics mean she has to close schools in Christchurch, but she agreed to integrate Wanganui Collegiate despite 1400 places already being spare at other high schools in the area,” said Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

“The decision to hand out more cash to Wanganui Collegiate is a slap in the face for Christchurch students, parents and teachers who are desperately trying to save the schools that helped them through the traumatic experiences of the last two and a half years.

“Both the Ministry of Education and Treasury repeatedly told the Government not to let Wanganui Collegiate become a state integrated school, but Hekia Parata failed to listen.

“The Ministry of Education warned that this decision could hurt other schools in Whanganui. This is yet another example of Hekia Parata’s failure to care about the impacts of her decisions on anyone other than the National Party’s rich mates,” Ms Delahunty said.
