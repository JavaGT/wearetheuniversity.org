**Greens acknowledge Fitzsimons CNZM investiture**

The Green Party congratulated former Co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons today on her investiture as a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

Ms Fitzsimons' long service to the Green Party and her 14 years as a Member of Parliament were acknowledged in last year’s Queen's Birthday Honours and she is to be formally recognised at an investiture ceremony this afternoon at Government House in Wellington.

"Jeanette is an outstanding champion for the environment, for a fair society and for honest politics," said current Co-leader Metiria Turei. "She deserves every accolade.”

Highlights of Ms Fitzsimons’ political career have included leading New Zealand’s debate on genetic engineering and championing a home insulation scheme which is now the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart program, a $323 million Government project that has already improved 90,000 Kiwi homes and will retrofit 180,000 in total.

Heading into winter, hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders could thank Ms Fitzsimons for warmer, drier homes, Mrs Turei said.
