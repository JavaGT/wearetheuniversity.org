More Free Mental Health Support for Young People
================================================

The Green Party welcomes the expansion of free youth mental health support announced today, says Green Party mental health spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick.

“We understand that mental health services are in crisis and that we need urgent solutions grounded in communities. That’s why the Green Party made this a priority in our Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Labour Party,” Chlöe Swarbrick said.

“For the last two years I’ve worked with dedicated advocates at Victoria University Students’ Association in their fight to reduce wait times for students accessing crucial mental health services. Today, the Government is announcing the wait is over. This wouldn’t be happening without the staunch mahi of students and their representatives.”

“This roll-out of Piki to Victoria University of Wellington, Massey University, and institutions throughout the Wellington Capital and Coast DHB areas is a massive step towards delivering accessible mental health and well-being services for our country’s young people.”

“If you are between 18 and 25 you and in need of support, you can access Piki by reaching out, or having a GP do it for you.”

“Our Confidence and Supply Agreement guarantees a commitment to high quality and timely mental health services for everyone, including free counselling for those under 25 years. Today’s announcement works towards fulfilling that commitment. The Greens are dedicated to continuing our constructive work in Government, as well as advocating for the community, to see that everybody has the help they need when they need it,” Chlöe Swarbrick said.
