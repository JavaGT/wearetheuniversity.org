Civics education initiative should be expanded

The Greens are applauding a new website learning tool, launched by the Government today, which will make it easier for children to learn about the court system.

“Civics education has been a key Green policy for many years, and we are pleased to see the Government taking some steps towards this,” said Green Youth Affairs Spokesperson Nandor Tanczos.

“Understanding the legal system and the basic rights and responsibilities of citizenship is crucial to a healthy civil society. I congratulate Courts Minister Rick Barker for undertaking this programme.”

However, Nandor said he urged the Government to expand on the programme and make civics education a greater part of the schools curriculum.

“Schools can have a positive influence on children and young people’s lifestyle choices and behaviour. All students ought to be taught conflict resolution skills, to encourage them to avoid violence and think in terms of justice and reconciliation.

“They should also all be taught a broad, civics programme, including lessons about our parliamentary system, the law, and human rights.”
