Stop acting like Muppets and cancel all GE trials

Stop acting like Muppets and cancel all GE trials

"The scientists off the Muppet Show, Dr Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker, would have more luck in containing a GE field trial than Crop and Food Research," said Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons.

The latest botch up at Crop and Food has led to a 10 year vegetable genetic modification trial being cancelled.

Ms Fitzsimons said this was the latest in a series of compliance failures by Crop and Food which stretch back to the 1980s.

The Royal Commission on GM in its' landmark report highlighted the lack of safeguards around an earlier GE trial concerning tamarillos in Northland.

Now a trial at Lincoln, near Christchurch, has ended after quarantine failures and a report has recommended the trial manager be investigated.

"The public has completely opposed the growing of GE crops in New Zealand and the government has constantly assured the public that the controls around these trials are of the highest standard. This is clearly not true," said Ms Fitzsimons.

"For the sake of the environment, New Zealand's clean green image, and our organics sector, the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) must stop any more GE trials by Crop and Food - who are clearly not competent to protect the New Zealand environment. "If this pattern continues it will be sooner, rather than later, that New Zealand's environment and export advantage is completely destroyed. It is time to play it safe and stop all GE trials in New Zealand," said Ms Fitzsimons.
