Burger chain chomps into teen free speech

Green MP Nandor Tanczos says the banning of youth newspaper Tearaway from some McDonald's restaurants is censorship of issues important to young people.

Some McDonald's franchisee stores have banned the current issue of the magazine because it deals with sexuality and is running a competition giving away condoms and lubricants.

Nandor, the Green Youth spokesperson, said the move is denying an important source of information for young people.

"I am disappointed they would choose to ban this magazine because it talks about sex, an issue of vital interest to young people," said Nandor.

"We need to encourage young people to discuss the issues that affect them.

"The move to ban the publication, which is read by thousands of teenagers, is ignorant and prudish.

"I don't know why anyone would go to McDonald's anyway, but this is further proof that the social and physical wellbeing of young people is the furthest thing from Ronald's mind."
