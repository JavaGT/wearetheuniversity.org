Greens release MP portfolios for 50th Parliament
================================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

**Greens release MP portfolios for 50th Parliament**

With a new expanded caucus of 14 MPs, the Green Party today released a list of what portfolios those MPs will be concentrating on.

Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei will have overall responsibility of issues relating to society and justice, including Maori Affairs. Green Party Co-leader Dr Russel Norman will maintain a wide-ranging brief over the economics and environment portfolios.

A number of new MPs will bring a long history of specialist knowledge to their portfolio areas. Former transport consultant Julie-Anne Genter will be keeping an eye on new Transport Minister Gerry Brownlee’s plans. With big changes tipped for the industrial relations sector, long time worker’s rights advocate Denise Roche will be concentrating on the industrial relations portfolio.

Former Environment Canterbury councillor Eugenie Sage will also be playing a large role with big environmental portfolios to keep an eye on such as conservation and water issues.

The job of organising the expanded caucus moves from Dr Kennedy Graham to new Green Party musterer (whip) Gareth Hughes.
