A great step forward for young workers

The settlement of the first Collective Employment Agreement between Restaurant Brands and the Unite Union is a great step forward in the campaign for wage justice and equity for young workers, according to Green Party Industrial Relations Spokesperson Sue Bradford.

"This settlement has been achieved because of the brilliant campaigning and organising of the Unite Union, together with strong support from school students, young workers, other unions and the community as a whole. The Green Party is proud to be part of that community support," Ms Bradford says.

"I am delighted to see that the agreement provides for wage increases of between 7 and 47 percent, minimises the use of casual labour, and brings youth rates up from 80 to 90 percent of the adult rate. It is also pleasing to see that all workers under twenty years of age who hold positions of responsibility will be paid the adult plus responsibility rate.

"This settlement shows that major employers have no stomach to continue with exploitative youth rates. This is yet another compelling reason for Parliament to pass my Bill to scrap youth rates.

"Young workers now have the opportunity to use the political as well as the industrial processes to achieve their goals by making a submission to the select committee considering the Bill.

"I commend Restaurant Brands for reaching this settlement with the Unite union and challenge other fast food chains and employers of young workers to better this agreement. We should move quickly move towards a $12 minimum wage with no youth rates and an end to the exploitative casualisation system of work," Ms Bradford says.
