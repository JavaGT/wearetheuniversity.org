A victory for Kiwis who stood up for World Heritage Area

**Tunnel decision a victory for Kiwis who stood up for World Heritage Area**

Today’s decision to decline an application to build a tunnel under a World Heritage Area is a victory for the thousands of New Zealanders who have demanded protection for our spectacular national parks, the Green Party says.

Conservation Minister Nick Smith has declined Milford Dart Ltd’s proposal to run an 11.3 km private road tunnel through Te Wahipounamu, the South West New Zealand World Heritage Area. The tunnel through Fiordland and Mt Aspiring National Parks would have run from the start of the Routeburn Track through to the Hollyford Valley.

“This decision is a tribute to the thousands of Kiwis and supporters overseas who stood up for our national parks. More than 1200 individuals and organisations made the effort to make submissions, and more than 25,000 people signed the Stop the Tunnel petition,” Green Party conservation spokesperson Eugenie Sage said.

“The Green Party stood alongside these people seeking to protect our national parks and we highlighted concerns.

“It’s wonderful that the Minister has listened. His decision also reflects what is required by the law. The National Parks Act, the General Policy for National Parks and national park management plans, developed with community input, have clear rules on what is appropriate in our national parks. A private road tunnel would have been at odds with these provisions. Saying ‘yes’ to the tunnel would have risked a judicial review case in the High Court.

“Increasing tourism revenue is about protecting wild, unspoilt nature that makes New Zealand special and underpins our 100% Pure NZ brand. It’s about slowing visitors down so they stay longer and spend more; not pushing them 11 km underground to save a few hours travel.

“I hope Nick Smith will make a similar decision on the proposed monorail on conservation land through Snowdon Forest in the World Heritage Area near Te Anau.

“For the monorail, Riverstone Holdings Ltd wants legal control over a 200 metre-wide and 43 km-long swathe of conservation land. It wants to fell tens of thousands of beech trees for major earthworks on some steep slopes to construct the 43 km monorail track, maintenance track, bridging and power lines,” Ms Sage said.

“New Zealanders love and want to protect our national parks and conservation parks. They want to enjoy nature on nature’s terms. The tunnel and the monorail are at odds with that.”
