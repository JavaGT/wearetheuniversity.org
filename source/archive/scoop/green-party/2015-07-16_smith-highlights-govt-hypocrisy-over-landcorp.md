Smith highlights Govt hypocrisy over Landcorp

It is hypocritical of Nick Smith to celebrate the reduction in nitrogen in Lake Taupo while at the same time, the National Government is converting more forests into dairy farms just down the road, said the Green Party today.

“It is a total contradiction for Nick Smith to be on Lake Taupo, talking up the reduction in nitrogen plan, when the Government owned Landcorp is adding to nitrogen in the waterways in the area by converting forests into dairy farms,” said Green Party water spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

“Landcorp will be managing the Wairakei Estate dairy farm which plans to add 33,000 more cows by 2021 just down the road, which is significantly going to increase the pollution to our waterways in the area.

“It is a slap in the face to say to farmers that they need to get used to the pain and reduce their nitrogen levels, when at the same time the Government is doing the exact opposite; it is absolute hypocrisy.

“No one thinks the Landcorp conversion is a good idea, even the Waikato Federated Farmers have raised the issue of the impact of the conversion on the efforts of farmers to reduce nitrogen leaching downstream.

“Nick Smith should have a word in the ear of the Minister of State Owned Enterprises if he is so concerned about water quality and get him to put a moratorium on the conversions; the Government should not be part of the problem.

“The Green Party currently has a petition in from of the Primary Product Select Committee and if Nick Smith is serious about improving our water quality, he needs to support the petition,” said Ms Delahunty.
