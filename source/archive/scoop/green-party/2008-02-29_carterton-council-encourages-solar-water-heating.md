Carterton council encourages solar water heating

Government Spokesperson on Energy Efficiency and Conservation, Jeanette Fitzsimons, has congratulated Carterton District Council for its initiative to encourage solar water heating by waiving building consent fees, during a visit to the Wairarapa today.

"I am delighted that Carterton District Council is taking this positive step to encourage its homeowners to install solar water heating," Ms Fitzsimons says.

"Building consent fees for solar water heating vary significantly across councils and can be a price hurdle for homeowners considering installing a system."

Carterton District Council is among five councils to commit to zero consent fees for solar water heating. Other councils to have committed to the initiative are Hamilton City Council, Waitakere City Council, Westland District Council and South Waikato District Council.

"I strongly encourage other councils to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability by following the example set by Carterton District Council."

Hot water accounts for around $800 of an average household energy bill. A well-designed and installed solar water heating system can save up to 75 percent of a household's annual hot water bills. Solar water heating systems, including cylinder, typically cost between $4000 and $8000 installed.

The Government is encouraging solar water heating as part of its broad approach to promoting energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. The programme includes a website (www.energywise.govt.nz/solar) where consumers can get independent information about how to assess whether solar is the right solution for their homes, and a $500 grant towards installing a solar water heating system, Ms Fitzsimons says.
