Green Party has solutions to child poverty problems

The Green Party has a plan to address the child poverty problems highlighted in the TV3 documentary Inside Child Poverty tonight, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said.

“The Green Party has solutions that will bring 100,000 children out of poverty by 2014. We have made this an election priority,” Mrs Turei said.

“The Green Party’s plan to lift 100,000 children out of poverty addresses many of the issues which were raised in the documentary, including ensuring kids have warm healthy houses, minimum housing standards, and making Working for Families Work for the most vulnerable.

“We would also immediately raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance so sole parents can enter into University study.

Mrs Turei said that these issues are a result of both Labour and National doing nothing to help those children that need the most.

"Child poverty didn't happen overnight. Labour and National's policies over many years have created serious deprivation in New Zealand.

“National has done nothing to address child poverty this term. In fact their policies will make inequality and poverty worse in New Zealand.  
“National’s welfare reforms will increase the risks to children by forcing mothers to leave their kids in potentially unsafe situations while they’re forced into work for fear of losing their benefit.  
Mrs Turei said that the documentary showed there are huge costs to not addressing child poverty.

“Child poverty costs us all, but it doesn't cost much to end it. To implement our solutions to bring 100,000 children out of poverty would cost approximately $360 million per year for the next three years — less than 0.3 percent of GDP,” Mrs Turei said.

“As the documentary showed, kids need warm healthy houses. The Green Party will create minimum performance standards for rental properties and continue with the home insulation scheme.

“Inside Child Poverty also highlighted that Working For Families wasn’t working for the people who need it the most. The Green Party will extend the In Work Tax Credit to the families who rely on benefits.”
