Jeanette Fitzsimons Calls For Waihi Inquiry
===========================================

**Thursday, 13 December 2001, 10:18 am**  
**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Coromandel MP and Green Party Co-leader, Jeanette Fitzsimons is returning to her electorate to see for herself the damage from the latest subsidence in Waihi.

She is also calling for an inquiry into the spate of slips to plague the town, but one not organised by the mining company.

"Although much of Waihi sits above old mine tunnels, I note that this is the third subsidence in the area of town immediately adjacent to the existing mine," said Ms Fitzsimons.

"The existing mine continues to pump thousands of cubic metres of water a day out of the ground, while blasting can be felt all the way across the town."

"An engineering consultant's report after the last subsidence found no connection between the collapse and the activities of the existing mine," said Ms Fitzsimons. "However, this 'coincidence' is getting harder to believe with every subsequent collapse."

"We must have an independent inquiry into the causes of the last three collapses, with contestable evidence offered from geologists and engineers," said Ms Fitzsimons.

"The community needs to know."

Ms Fitzsimons will visit Waihi this afternoon to check on the safety of the residents and see for herself the damage caused by the latest slip.
