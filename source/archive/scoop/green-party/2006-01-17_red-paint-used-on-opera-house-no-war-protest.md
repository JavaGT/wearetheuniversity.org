Red paint can is Scully's chance to sparkle

Greens MP and justice spokesperson, Lee Rhiannon has called on Police  
Minister Carl Scully to step in and save the can of red paint that was used to paint 'No War' on the Opera House.

"Minister Scully will become the scourge of the peace movement in  
Australia if he does not stop this mean spirited effort to destroy a little piece of Australian history." said Ms Rhiannon.

"That little red paint pot is a symbol of the hopes expressed by half a million Australians who protested our involvement in the war in Iraq in 2003.

"When I saw the big red 'No War' letters painted on the Opera House walls I knew that history had been made.

"If Dave Burgess and Will Saunders cannot profit from the sale of the red paint can then it should be preserved for posterity.

"Destroying this evidence is tantamount to censoring the history of Australia's opposition to the war in Iraq.

"Students will learn about the 'No War' Opera House protest for years to come and form their own views about what must be the most controversial act of protest in our nation's past.

"The Greens and peace groups would be willing to raise money to preserve and exhibit these historical artefacts.

"I urge Minister Scully to step in and save this little piece of Australian history." said Ms Rhiannon.
