Free buses an idea whose timetable should come

Today's Otago Daily Times editorial urging a study into the feasibility of free buses for Dunedin has been welcomed by the city's Green Party MP, Metiria Turei.

"The idea of free buses has taken root in cities around the world, from Amsterdam to our closest city neighbour, Invercargill. I agree with the editor that it must be taken seriously by the city's decision-makers," Mrs Turei says.

"There are many obstacles to the use of public transport. Free buses remove not merely the barrier of cost. Free buses also address the issues of timeliness and frequency, which can also be barriers to the regular use of buses by the public.

"With petrol prices on the rise, our community is looking for solutions to their transport needs. Public transport services that are easier for everyone to access and use can only be good for them, and for our city.

"Transport is an important issue for New Zealand to tackle, because it is the fastest growing contributor to climate disruption, and already produces over 18 percent of this country's total greenhouse emissions," Mrs Turei says.

"We need to take all the chances we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - and increasing the use of public transport offers a significant opportunity to do so. "
