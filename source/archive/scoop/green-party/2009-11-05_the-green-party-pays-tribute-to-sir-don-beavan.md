The Green Party pays tribute to Sir Don Beavan

Green Party MP Sue Kedgley today paid tribute to Sir Don Beavan for his outstanding work on diabetes treatment and prevention. Sir Don Beavan died tragically in a house fire in Canterbury yesterday.

“Don earned respect worldwide for his outstanding research, and his passion to tackle the disease of diabetes,” said Ms Kedgley.

“He was absolutely convinced of the link between type 2 diabetes and diet and lifestyle, and he was passionately committed to improving the New Zealand diet.

“Don made submissions to Parliament’s Health select committee on many occasions in recent years, and MPs were always captivated by his passion, the depth of his knowledge and his conviction of the close links between unhealthy eating and the disease.

“The greatest tribute to him would be for others to continue Don’s research and to implement some of the many recommendations he has made over the years to reduce the epidemic of diabetes, and to assist people suffering from the disease.”

ENDS
