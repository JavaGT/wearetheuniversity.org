Green MPs kick off national tertiary tour in Auckland

**Green MPs kick off national tertiary tour in Auckland**

Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei and Green MP Marama Davidson are inviting one and all to come along to tertiary campuses to discuss rental housing, inequality and how Green Party policies, like a housing WoF, can make our country better for everyone.

Mrs Turei and Ms Davidson are visiting six tertiary campuses around the country to discuss these issues and more, starting in Auckland on 28 April. Media, students and their friends and whanau are all welcome.

“We’d encourage everyone to come along – whether you’re really interested in politics, like us, or if you just want to vent about your cold, mouldy, expensive flat,” said Mrs Turei.

“With the cost of housing going up and wages not rising to match, students are facing an uncertain future. Trying to find a decent job after graduating can be really worrying.

“It doesn’t have to be like this. In fact, there are heaps of ways the Green Party will do things differently to National when we’re in government, and we’re going to be talking about those on this tour.

“There are smart, sensible, compassionate policies we can bring in to make the playing field fairer for all New Zealanders, not just for those who are already doing well,” said Mrs Turei.

“I’m really looking forward to hitting the road with Metiria and hearing about what’s really going on with our students and young people,” said Ms Davidson.

“We all know it’s getting harder and more expensive to be a student, with housing costs going up and student financial support not reaching far enough.
