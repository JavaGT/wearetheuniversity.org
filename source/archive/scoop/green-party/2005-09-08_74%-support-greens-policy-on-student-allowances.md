Poll shows 74% support Greens' policy on student allowances

The Greens are today calling on all other political parties to follow their lead in supporting a universal living allowance for all fulltime students, following a poll showing three quarters of those surveyed want allowances extended.

The nationwide poll conducted by Colmar Brunton has found that 74 percent of the 700 people interviewed believed that more students should receive a living allowance.

"The Greens have been saying since 1999 that if you're a fulltime student, you should be getting a living allowance," Tertiary Education spokesperson Nandor Tanczos says

"Students are the only adults in our society who are unable to take full-time work and are often excluded from income support. It's time this inequity is addressed so that students no longer have to borrow money just to pay the bills."

"It's not just a question of increasing the number of students getting an allowance of some kind, if that just means a few more people getting ten dollars a week. All full-time students should get a full allowance.

"Labour's moves on student support are better than nothing, but they don't address one of the main drivers of debt in the first place, having to borrow to live.

"Only the Greens will ensure that the issue of student allowances is on the next Government's agenda and the best way to make sure that that happens is to Party Vote Green, " Nandor says.
