Greens Call On Govt To Wake Up On Child Poverty
===============================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The Green Party says the latest statistics on child poverty in this country highlight the callous approach that the Government is taking on this issue of national shame.

“Not only is it clear that the Government isn’t focussed enough on stopping child poverty, but also that its policies are making the problem worse by entrenching low-income households in the poverty cycle,” says the Green Party’s Spokesperson for Poverty Reduction, Ricardo Menéndez March.

“We can eliminate child poverty - we have enough in this country to guarantee that all children are adequately fed and housed. All children deserve this.

> “However, the latest figures show that more than half of children in material hardship live in working households - while at the same time the Government’s telling families that work is the only way out of poverty.

“As if these whanau didn’t have it hard enough - with the Government making them pay more at the doctor, more at the pharmacy and more for public transport - thousands of public service jobs are being cut while the Government reduces frontline support for those who are struggling.

“Māori, Pacific and disabled children are disproportionately affected by child poverty - the very groups who are hit the hardest by the policies of a Government which has bent over backwards to give 3 billion dollars of tax cuts to landlords and property investors while ignoring the many struggling.

“The Government must start listening to expert advice which in this case says unequivocally that sustained and cross-party commitment is required to properly address child poverty.

“The Chief Children’s Commissioner’s report also makes very clear that if we are to address the material hardship many children face it is paramount that we lift incomes, and provide practical support and investments focused on children’s wellbeing.

“We know that experiences in the first few years of a child’s life have a large bearing on the rest of their lives. Living in a household mired in poverty has long-term consequences for our kids and their wellbeing.

“But there is no good reason for children in Aotearoa to go hungry or to live in damp, cold houses. Child poverty is a political choice.

“The Green Party would guarantee liveable incomes for whanau, while investing in the support networks that communities need to ensure children have all their rights met - even when times are tough,” says Ricardo Menéndez March.
