Welfare Working Group Cries Crocodile Tears for the Poor

Comments by Chairperson of the Welfare Working Group Paula Rebstock on 'Q and A' this week expressed crocodile tears for beneficiaries trapped in poverty, said Green Party Work and Income spokesperson Catherine Delahunty today.

"She acknowledges people want jobs, but before their work is even finished, the Welfare Working Group's real agenda is clear.

"Paula Rebstock is helping to manufacture a sense of crisis and blame so that benefits can be cut and people sanctioned when they cannot find work in a recession.

"Paula's comments that 'any job is a good job if done well' ignores the state of the labour market and real issues for people with disabilities, who are solo parents or on the sickness benefit.

"Roughly three quarters of people who rely on welfare support do so for less than a year, to get through challenging situations.

"Her logic that being on a benefit makes you sick is a cheap shot. Sending sick and disabled people into jobs that are inappropriate for them will increase illness and stress," said Ms Delahunty.

"Where is the leadership from the Welfare Working Group on job creation and educational opportunities for beneficiaries?"

Ms Delahunty said the Government had cut the Training Incentive Allowance for sole parents and capped places in tertiary institutions.

"As disability spokesperson I am particularly concerned about the rhetoric around jobs being great for people with disabilities, when jobs are scarce and these most vulnerable people are last on the list of many employers.

"The focus should be on job creation for a living wage, raising the minimum wage and educational opportunities, not beneficiary bashing disguised as empowerment," said Ms Delahunty.

"A fair society provides the essentials so that people have opportunities, especially in hard times."
