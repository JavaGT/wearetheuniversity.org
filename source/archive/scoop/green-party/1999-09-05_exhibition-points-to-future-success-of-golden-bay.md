Exhibition points to future success of Golden Bay

A Golden Bay artists' exhibition at Wellington's Michael Fowler Centre this week is a pointer to the region's future success, says Green MP Rod Donald.

Art from about 50 Golden Bay artists goes on display from 7-11 September in the MFC's Fletcher Challenge Foyer. Mr Donald hosts the event on Tuesday, 7 September from 5.30pm -7.30pm, with guest speaker well-known mountaineer Peter Hillary.

Mr Donald said the exhibition was an exciting initiative which showed the beauty of the region.

"The economic future of Golden Bay rests heavily on its growing reputation for inspirational art, its remote and expansive beaches, unobstructed seascape, and native bush and natural heritage.

"This exhibition is a positive step towards helping that future vision take root."

The exhibition is organised by the Friends of Golden Bay Society in conjunction with Victoria University's Tourism and Services Management Programme.

Green Party West Coast Tasman candidate Richard Davies said the society had been active in opposing the extension of marine farming in the bay - excluding it from within three nautical miles of beaches - but the exhibition showed the society was not anti-business.

"We don't oppose marine farming, but the society is determined to find a balance between those activities that exploit the environment and businesses, such as art and tourism, that depend on keeping it in its natural state."

The Friends of Golden Bay Society's approach to commercial development in the area was very much in line with Green Party policy, Mr Davies said.
