**New MP in Hutt South?**

Lower Hutt Could Have First Female MP Since Sonja Davies in 2011

Green Party Hutt South Candidate Holly Walker has been confirmed at number 12 on the Green Party’s candidate list for the 2011 election. If elected, she would become the first female MP from Lower Hutt since Sonja Davies retired in 1993.

“It’s a great vote of confidence from the Party’s members to be ranked so highly and a great motivator for the campaign trail,” said the 28-year-old Petone resident.

“Support for the Green Party is growing and we’re expecting to have more MPs elected this year. I’ll be campaigning as hard as I can for the Party vote and hope to go to Parliament in December.

“It’d be great to have another voice for Hutt South in Parliament. It would be a particular honour to become the first female MP from Lower Hutt for 18 years, and to represent the interests of Hutt Valley women.”

If the Green Party receives 10 per cent of the party vote in November's election, as it has in recent polls, Ms Walker would be elected.

Ms Walker said she and other Green candidates would be talking throughout the campaign about the potential for a smart, green economy that looked after all New Zealanders. “Our environment is at the heart of our economy. If we look after our precious natural resources – like the Hutt River – we look after our future.”

Green Party co-leader Metiria Tūrei offered her congratulations to Ms Walker: “Holly has done really well to earn this ranking. We’ve got some very talented and hardworking candidates and it has been very competitive.”

Ms Walker grew up in Petone and attended Hutt Valley High School. In 2007 she was awarded a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford University, where she completed her Masters in International Development in 2009.

The Green Party has ranked 30 candidates for the 2011 general election and has an additional 15 candidates currently confirmed to contest the Party vote in November.

Party members voted on the list in April and May. It was then subject to minor adjustments in order to meet certain balancing criteria for gender, Maori, South island and youth representation.

It is the first time Holly Walker has stood in the Hutt South electorate where she sees great potential for the Greens’ Party vote to grow in 2011.

She has launched a website for her campaign: [www.hollywalker.co.nz](http://www.hollywalker.co.nz/).
