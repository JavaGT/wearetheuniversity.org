Research buried by political interference

The Green Party is alarmed by reports of censorship of state funded research that appears to have become the victim of political interference.

"The lack of independence shown by the Families Commission in suddenly withdrawing support for this research after one of its authors used its findings as part of a submission to Parliament is very disturbing," Social Development Spokesperson Sue Bradford says.

In an interview on National Radio this morning, Rotorua People's Advocacy Centre's Paul Blair described how the report, entitled 'Improving Work Life Balance for Domestic Purposes Beneficiaries Sole Parent Families', had been signed off, favourably peer reviewed and its publication assured. It suddenly became a political football after his use of an excerpt in a submission on the Social Security Amendment Bill. "I find the direct political interference in the release of a finished, commissioned piece of research incredible, especially at a time when the research is particularly relevant to MPs debating a bill before Parliament.

"The timing could not be clearer. Before 28 March everything was on track - the report and peer reviews were complete, the Families Commission had made a final payment for work done and signed it off for publication.

On 28 March, Mr Blair submitted a short summary of RPAC's research findings as part of his submission to the Select Committee, having sought permission from the Commission who authorised him to do so.

Two days later, the final report was suddenly renamed by the Families Commission, retrospectively becoming a 'draft final report' and eight pages of new demands for changes were submitted to the authors.

"Minister Benson-Pope's derisive comments on the research in the House on the 15 May, including calling the "so-called research...seriously wanting", are in complete contradiction to the opinion of both peer reviewers," Ms Bradford says.

The Families Commission's own external reviewer, University of Auckland's Professor Maureen Baker, called the study "...exceptionally well done and contain\[ing\] valuable recommendations for the Ministry of Social Development. In fact, the report is so carefully written that there are very few words that need to be altered."

"I congratulate the Rotorua People's Advocacy Centre for refusing to buckle to political pressure and for continuing to push for full publication of this highly relevant research as soon as possible. The taxpayer has invested in this project, and would want the results known and examined, rather than buried because the findings do not suit the Government line," Ms Bradford says.
