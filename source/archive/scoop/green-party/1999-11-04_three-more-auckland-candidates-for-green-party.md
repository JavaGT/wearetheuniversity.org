Three more Auckland candidates for Green Party
==============================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

The Green Party has announced three more candidates for Auckland, bringing its final number of electorate candidates to 50 for the November 27 general election.

The three new candidates are David Rose (Pakuranga), Adrian Tyler (Te Atatu) and Barry Larsen (North Shore).

David Rose, 41, is married with two sons. He has an MA in Political Studies and is currently Manager of the Howick Trade Aid outlet. He has been a campaign organiser for the Greens since 1990.

Mr Rose is also developing a 58ha block with a group of people committed to permaculture in both land and stock management. Adrian Tyler, 28, has a degree in Education and Sociology and a strong background in grassroots environmental activities. He has just returned from five months in Canada which included working on a roadshow opposing the World Trade Organisation.

Mr Tyler, Auckland born and raised, has a passion for the pollution issues of the Waitemata Harbour. He is particularly interested in Green issues from a bicultural and social justice perspective. Barry Larsen, 30, works in a flower nursery and in his time-off has given thousands of hours to the Green Party as a North Shore organiser.

Mr Larsen is highly respected as a grassroots person who works hard and is totally committed to organics, strong communities and a clean environment.

Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said the three new Auckland candidates were all strongly committed to the Green vision and would bring a fresh and exciting approach to the Green campaign.

The three candidates would be campaigning for the party vote to help the Green Party cross the five per cent threshold and ensure the return of Green MPs to the new parliament, Ms Fitzsimons said.
