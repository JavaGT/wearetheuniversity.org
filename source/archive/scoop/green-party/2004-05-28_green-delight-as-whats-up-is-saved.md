Green delight as What's Up? is saved

Green MP Nándor Tánczos says he's absolutely rapt that the Government has found the money to see youth counselling hot-line What's Up? continue its awesome work.

"It's fantastic that Ruth Dyson has listened to the concerns of the hundreds of students, teachers, parents and other concerned community members who signed the petition to save What's Up?

Nandor is full of praise for the 12-year-old who was concerned enough to initiate the petition, Shonam Reddy.

"I'm stoked that this valuable service for the youth of Aotearoa will remain open beyond tonight. I congratulate the Minister for seeing the value of this service and in particular, I want to congratulate Shonam and the pupils and staff of Randwick Park School for all their hard campaigning to keep "What's Up? running."

Sue Kedgley will present Shonam's petition to Hon Ruth Dyson at her office (4.1 Beehive) 3.30pm.

ENDS
