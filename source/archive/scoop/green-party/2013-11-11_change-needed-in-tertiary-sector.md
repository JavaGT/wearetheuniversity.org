Change needed in tertiary sector

The Green Party is supporting the Tertiary Education Union’s (TEU) call for New Zealand to rebuild our public tertiary education system after years of declining public funding and increasing pressures on tertiary students and staff.

The TEU has today released their report Te Kaupapa Whaioranga: The blueprint for tertiary education, which sets out proposals to return tertiary education in New Zealand to an equitable and accessible system focused on the public good, rather than the current market-driven system, focused on private needs.

“This report paints a highly concerning picture of our tertiary sector,” Green Party tertiary spokesperson David Clendon said today.

“Short-sighted changes made by this Government have undermined New Zealand’s tertiary education system, reducing it to a market-driven system focused on economic outcomes.

“We’re seeing a steady decline in public funding of the sector, at the same time as student numbers are increasing and the Government is demanding more from the sector.

“This is having a real effect on the student experience and the quality of employment for staff.

“The Government is being sent a strong and clear message with this report. Tertiary sector staff will no longer accept the current policies and decisions, which the TEU argue are destroying the quality of our tertiary education system.

“A vibrant tertiary sector is vital for the social, cultural, environmental and economic wellbeing of New Zealand.

“We need to return to a system that values the public good of education, guided by the principles of equitable and accessible education.”
