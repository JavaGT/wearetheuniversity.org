GE-Free and spin-free day

23 July 2002

All seven Green MPs will be out on the streets tomorrow reminding people that voting Green at the election is the only way to stop the Government lifting the moratorium next year.

"There's far too much spin in the GE debate already, so we'll be concentrating on setting the record straight and giving out very informative leaflets and stickers," said co-leader Ms Fitzsimons.

"I'm amazed by the comments from the Prime Minister on National Radio today that she is opposed to extending the moratorium because it could have a "devastating" impact on the economy.

"In actual fact, extending the moratorium could only benefit the economy by building on our international reputation for safe, natural, healthy food.

"By lifting the moratorium, the Government would be trashing that reputation. Embracing the release of GE is the surest way to devastate our economy."

Ms Fitzsimons said there were no New Zealand commercial releases ready to go in the next three years anyway, so extending the moratorium was a safe and reasonable way to go.

Green MPs will be handing out stickers and leaflets around the country tomorrow
