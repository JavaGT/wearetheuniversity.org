Prime Minister’s confidence in Hekia Parata woefully misplaced

John Key’s statement that Hekia Parata will remain the Minister of Education in the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle adds insult to injury for students, teachers and parents, the Green Party said today.

“Hekia Parata has time and time again frustrated the education sector, students and families with her damaging plans for education and her poor communication of those plans,” said Green Party education spokesperson Catherine Delahunty.

“From class sizes to Christchurch school closures and everything in between, 2012 was a year of poorly explained plans that would worsen our world-class education system.

“Parata has become known around the country for her incoherent rhetoric and her inability to answer simple questions, both in Parliament and with the public.

“Good communication involves listening as well as speaking, and Hekia Parata has time and time again refused to listen to those on the front lines of education.

“We need positive steps towards enhancing quality public education in New Zealand, and a Minister capable of communicating this to all those involved in education.

“Students, parents and teachers deserve a fresh start from this Government in 2013. Keeping Hekia Parata in place as Minister will mean that this sorely needed change in attitude will not occur,” Ms Delahunty said.
