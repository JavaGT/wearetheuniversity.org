**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green MP Nandor Tanczos will speak at several schools, the Hawkes Bay Restorative Justice AGM and play some records at a party when he visits Napier on Wednesday and Thursday 19 and 20 June.

Nandor arrives on Wednesday night and will help the Napier Green Party with their candidate selection meeting.

On Thursday morning, Nandor will have an informal meeting with students at Taruna College, an adult training centre at Te Mata Peak. He will meet with staff afterwards to hear their concerns on the re-organisation of tertiary funding.

He will also visit Taikoura Steiner School nearby at 11am.

Nandor will speak at the Eastern Institute of Technology campus at 12 noon on tertiary education issues.

He will address senior students at Flaxmere College at 1.15 and the Agriculture New Zealand Organics Course at 2.30.

At 3.30, Nandor will be at the Hastings Youth Centre on St Aubyn St to speak about the importance of voting in the upcoming election and to answer any questions young people may have.

The Hawkes' Bay Restorative Justice Group have invited Nandor to speak at their AGM on 'The State of Justice in the Community'. He will run a participatory discussion canvassing recent changes in the justice system, drawing on his experiences on the Justice and Electoral Select Committee over the last 2 ½ years.

The AGM will be held at the Baptist Lounge, Cnr Lyndon and Karamu Roads, Hastings starting at 7.30pm. Everyone is welcome to attend and to stay for supper afterwards, which will be provided by the Restorative Justice Group.

Later that evening Nandor will be at O'Flaherty's Irish Pub, 35 Hastings St, Napier from about 10.30pm to play a set of reggae, ska and dancehall vinyl.

Copies of the GreenRoom 001 CD recently released by the Green Party and LOOP recordings will be available.
