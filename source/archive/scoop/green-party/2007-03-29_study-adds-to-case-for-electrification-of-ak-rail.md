LTNZ study adds to case for electrification of Auckland rail

Green media release 28th March 2007

A new study by Canterbury University researchers for Land Transport New Zealand has added to the case for the electrification of the Auckland rail network, says the Green Party, and it’s time the Government agreed to partially fund the project.

“The study develops a model to examine the impact of peak oil on different kinds of urban development and shows that urban forms with higher densities and better public transport, as opposed to urban sprawl, are best able to cope with escalating oil prices,” says Russel Norman, Green Co-Leader and Economics Spokesperson.

“The kind of urban development that the electrification of the Auckland rail network will enable is exactly the kind of development that will best be able to cope with escalating oil prices. While this study looked at Christchurch, the same lessons apply to Auckland.

“The electrification of the Auckland rail network will create the opportunity to increase densities around the rail corridors in a way that diesel rail units do not.

“People are more willing to live closer to electric rail corridors because electric rail units are quieter and produce less air pollution than diesel units. This creates higher densities and much more energy efficient travel patterns.

“It is in the interests of all New Zealanders for central government to assist Auckland to electrify its rail network because Auckland is central to the national economy and one in three New Zealanders live there. Auckland’s gridlock is costing the country plenty and it cannot be solved by building more and more roads.

“It’s a tribute to Land Transport New Zealand that they commissioned this study. Now we just need to get the conclusions of the study incorporated into land transport planning in New Zealand.”
