Greens’ Climate Defence Tour hits Auckland
==========================================

Greens’ Climate Defence Tour hits Auckland

Green Party Co-Leader Jeanette Fitzsimons will be in Auckland this week leading the Greens' Climate Defence Tour. Ms Fitzsimons will host a public meeting and a local action workshop discussing what local communities can do about climate change in Counties-Manukau, followed by central and West Auckland next week.

“Climate change is one of the greatest threats facing the planet and as the recent IPCC Forth Assessment Report predicts less rain and droughts for some regions and heavy rain leading to flooding and erosion in others, the time for urgent action in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is now,” Ms Fitzsimons says.

“As I have travelled the country, visiting Canterbury, Marlborough and the top of the south I have been heartened by the level of interest in and concern about climate change. People want to understand the big picture and want to know what they can do, and I think that's fantastic,” Ms Fitzsimons says.

The Green Party has recently released its new climate change policy 'Kicking the Carbon Habit' and is proposing a Climate Defence Fund, as large as New Zealand’s defence budget; a price on carbon across the economy and recycling the funds into emission reduction; energy efficiency and adaptation initiatives.

The meetings and workshops will be at:
