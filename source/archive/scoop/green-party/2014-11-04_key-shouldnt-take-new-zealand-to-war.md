**Key shouldn’t take New Zealand to war**

Prime Minister John Key should not seek to involve New Zealand in a conflict with the Islamic State, Green Party Co-leader Metiria Turei said today.

Prime Minister John Key signalled this week that a New Zealand commitment to a campaign against the Islamic State in the Middle East could be for a long time, and pointed to the ten-year deployment of troops in Afghanistan.

“New Zealand should not be dragged into an overseas conflict by John Key and our top military brass that there is no need to be involved in,” said Mrs Turei.

“Prior to the election, John Key played down the possibility that he would involve New Zealand in a Middle East conflict.

“Since the election however, the Prime Minister’s words and actions point towards his Government involving New Zealand in a conflict against tens of thousands of Sunni militants who control large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

“There is no doubt that the Islamic State threat is a very real one to the people of Syria and Iraq, but that does not mean New Zealand should have any military involvement.

“At present there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance as a result of the crisis in Iraq and Syria.

“To assist the suffering of those involved in this conflict New Zealand can consider taking more refugees from this part of the world.

“We could do far more good by providing shelter and aid money to those displaced by conflict than joining a so-called global coalition against the Islamic State,” Mrs Turei said.

“John Key should not sign New Zealand up to a war where we don’t know what the exit strategy is or how participating could affect New Zealand’s own security.”
