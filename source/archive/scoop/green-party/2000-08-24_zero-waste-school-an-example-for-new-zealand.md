Zero waste school an example for New Zealand

Kaikoura electorate-based Green Party MP Ian Ewen-Street today offered his congratulations to Kaikoura High School on their adoption of a zero waste strategy for the school.

Kaikoura High is the first school to adopt a zero waste strategy in New Zealand. They will recycle food waste in compost, and have recycle bins for cans, paper and other reusable materials.

"I am absolutely delighted that Kaikoura High are picking up the torch of sustainability and running with it," said Mr Ewen-Street.

"As a core party policy the Greens are committed to an overall goal of a zero waste in New Zealand and we are delighted that Kaikoura, and the young people in the area, are setting the example."

Kaikoura has a goal of zero waste in landfill by 2015.

"The entire Green Party extend their congratulations to the students and staff at Kaikoura High. It is forward thinking like this upon which this nation - and eventually the world - will soon come to depend. I hope other schools, businesses and households take a leaf out of their book," he said.
