Green Support Surges Amongst Maori Voters
=========================================

**Press Release: [Green Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Green_Party)**

Green Party co-leader Rod Donald said the Green message was getting through to Maori voters, as a Marae Digi-poll today revealed the Green Party has broken the 10 percent threshold.

Mr Donald said he was absolutely delighted that Maori voters were ready to give 11.7 percent of the party vote to the Greens.

"When our list is released on Wednesday, I think we will be able to deliver to Maori voters who are prepared to back us, with up to five Maori candidates in the top 30.

"In fact, I don't think it is breaking any confidences to say I fully expect a very strong Maori candidate, Metiria Turei, to be in the top ten."

Mr Donald put down the Green Party's surge in popularity particularly to their strong stand on genetic engineering.

"Many Maori feel strongly about this issue. I think the whole message is getting out to Maori -we want to keep genetic engineering in the lab, but that doesn't mean stopping the production of medicines such as GE insulin.

"We're also striking a chord with Maori because of our commitment to eliminate child poverty, and achieve full employment."

Metiria said many Maori voters wanted to see the Greens have a role in Government to keep Labour honest.

"Our support amongst Maori is growing also because of the work our MPs have done over the last three years, including trying to get better funding for Te Reo at tertiary level, opening up a national debate on the Treaty, backing restorative justice and marae-based programmes."
