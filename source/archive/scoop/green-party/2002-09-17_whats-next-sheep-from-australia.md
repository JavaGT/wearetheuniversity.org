What's next - sheep from Australia?

What's next - sheep from Australia?

Green 'Buy Local' Spokesperson Mike Ward today said he was surprised to learn that large chunks of Lambton Quay were being repaved with bricks imported from Australia.

He said the council deserved full marks for increasing the pedestrian spaces in the city and for employing locals to do the work but it appears that they forgot to let the contractor know about the Councils commitment to buying local.

"New Zealand has had a brick industry for over a hundred years and we ought to be well equipped to supply these bricks ourselves, so why are we shipping them in from Australia?" he asked.

"It makes good sense to spend as much of the ratepayers' money where it can find its way back into the ratepayers' pockets. What next? Will we start importing sheep from Australia too?"

Mr Ward said the thousands and thousands of bricks required for the massive repaving could have kept New Zealand businesses and workers in jobs instead of supporting Australian industry.

"This is a classic example of the role a council could play in supporting the New Zealand economy and New Zealand workers through buying local.

"Sadly this is another opportunity missed for New Zealand workers."
