Jeanette's record, and pledges, in manifesto

The majority of Coromandel voters will be hand-delivered MP Jeanette Fitzsimons' manifesto in the week leading up to the election.

"We will be knocking on doors all round the electorate for the next week," said Ms Fitzsimons, the Green Party co-leader who is leading the race for the Coromandel seat.

"We think the booklet is well worth a read, and we're taking the time to put it in peoples' hands."

The remaining three thousand booklets will be distributed to more remote voters by rural delivery mail.

Ms Fitzsimons said the response to the hand delivery service had so far been very positive, even from non-Green voters.

"People appreciate the chance to discuss the issues that concern them personally, and clear up some of the misinformation that has been spread around the electorate."

The colourful 16 page booklet outlines Ms Fitzsimons' commitments to the electorate, based on Green Party policies. It includes pages on the future of farming, how to rebuild the local economy and how to upgrade Thames hospital to a full secondary hospital.

It also contains the parliamentary voting record of Ms Fitzsimons and National MP Murray McLean on key bills during the 1996-1999 term.

"The information has been verified through the Parliamentary library," said Ms Fitzsimons. "I am happy to stand on my record."

"In 1996, 66 per cent of the Coromandel didn't want a National MP, but by splitting the vote that's what they ended up with," said Ms Fitzsimons. "People are starting to realise that voting for me is the only way to get a change."

Jeanette Fitzsimons MP 07 8686641, 07 8686511, 025 586068, 025 2471489, 025 2874325
