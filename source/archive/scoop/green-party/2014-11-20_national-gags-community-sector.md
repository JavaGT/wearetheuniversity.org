National gags community sector

National gags community sector

More than a quarter of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are being silenced with gag clauses under the National government, said the Green Party.

The alarming statistic comes from a recent study, into the community and voluntary sector, by Dr Sandra Grey from the University of Victoria. In her 2008 study, she found that only 12.9 percent of respondents, with government contracts, were subject to gag clauses. In 2013, that figure jumped to 25.8 percent.

“This is an abuse of power by National,” said Green Party community and voluntary sector spokesperson Jan Logie.

“What we are seeing is our democracy being compromised.

“Under National, the number of NGOs being told to keep quiet has more than doubled.

“If the Government truly believed in what they were doing, there would be no need to gag the agencies they give contracts to.

“You cannot have a functioning civil society, if NGOs are too scared to speak out.

“One in three New Zealanders volunteer because they believe NGOs play a really important role in our society. This role should not be limited by government.

“The study found that democracy is being manipulated by key power holders behind closed doors.

“The Green Party supports a strong and independent community and voluntary sector.

“These organisations play a valuable part in helping society and also keeping governments in check – this should not be compromised by the widespread use of gag orders,” said Ms Logie.
