Fee Setting to Add a Twist to Massey Debate

Fee Setting to Add a Twist to Massey Political Debate

Massey University Students’ Association will be hosting the second Talk Tertiary, a political debate of tertiary education issues, in Palmerston North tomorrow, Wednesday August 31st, on concourse at Massey’s Palmerston North Turitea campus at 12 pm.

Association President Iain Galloway expects fireworks from students dismayed that the Government’s Fee-Maxima policy can be cynically abused as shown by Massey’s senior management who are proposing a ten percent student tuition fee rise in 2006. “I am certain that students will want to know if this was ever the intention of the policy and what other parties would do if they were in charge of the Ministry of Education,” Mr Galloway said.

Although the intention was to focus on often over-looked issues such as the Performance Based Research Fund, entrance standards, retention and completion rates, there is no doubt that fees and the government proportion of tertiary funding will be in the forefront of students’ minds.

Attending Talk Tertiary will be Simon Power, Steve Maharey, Bernie Ogilvy, Lawrence O’Halloran, Craig Nair, Matt Robson and Pakake Winiata.
