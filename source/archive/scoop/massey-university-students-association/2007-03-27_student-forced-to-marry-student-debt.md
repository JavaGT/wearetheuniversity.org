Media Release

Attention: Education Reporters  
For Immediate Release  

Student Forced to Marry Student Debt

  
Tomorrow, as student loan debt reaches a massive Nine Billion Dollars, the debt monster at Massey University Palmerston North plans to hook another student into a long-term commitment.

The monster has been allowed to grow over the years because of endless fee increases, drop in student allowances, and poor government funding. The wedding ceremony tomorrow, joining the monster and student, is to signify that student debt is a life-long commitment and one that can have serious consequences.

Massey University Students’Association President Paul Falloon says that government policy is forcing students into larger and larger debt. “Fees are going up and student allowances are going down, Labour must put an end to this or else the monster will continue to grow.”

Public are invited to the wedding which will take place at noon on Wednesday 28 March at Massey University Palmerston North’s concourse. Falloon has requested that “no gifts be brought to the ceremony, just bring an end to debt”.
