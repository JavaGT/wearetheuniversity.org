PM challenged to swap jobs with student president

Massey students challenge PM to swap jobs with student President for a day

Massey Students are today challenging Prime Minster, Helen Clark to swap roles for a day with the Massey University Students Association (MUSA) President, Adam Maynard so that she can see first hand the destructive effects of government polices on students.

“Student debt has more than doubled under Labour and is now well over $6 billion, Helen Clark should swap jobs with me for a day and listen to the concerns of students about their mounting student loan debts,” said Adam Maynard, MUSA President.

The challenge was issued by students at MUSA’s Annual General Meeting who are concerned that only one third of students are entitled to a student allowance and the rest are forced to borrow to pay for basics like food and rent.

“The best solution to the current student debt crisis is to introduce a living allowance for all students which is a policy that Helen Clark agreed with in 1991” said Maynard “She should come back to University as Student President to remind herself why she thought a universal allowance was such a good idea while in opposition”

“It is not fair that students are the only group in society that have to borrow to live,” said Maynard.

“New Zealand needs a living allowance for all students” implored Maynard “These students are the future of our country, but with raising student debt they cannot afford to raise families and are leaving the country to seek employment overseas”.

Maynard said that he is comfortable dealing with both George Bush and Tony Blair while Prime Minister, but that Tertiary Education would be his focus while in the top job.

March 26, 2004 Rt Hon Helen Clark Prime Minister PO Box 18888 Parliament Buildings Wellington

To the Rt Hon Helen Clark

I am writing to you on behalf of Massey University students. At a recent general meeting of Massey students we determined that the Labour party has lost touch with students. Labour’s present policies and support for students have not met the expectations set during the previous general election.

We therefore invite you to swap roles with myself and take on the mantel of President of the Massey University Students’ Association for a day. It is hoped that from this position you will see the hardship that students now suffer and will continue to suffer unless a living allowance for all students is implemented soon.

The generation of debt will have far reaching implications. Today’s students are tomorrow’s teachers, workforce and leaders. But with ever increasing levels of debt they cannot afford to raise families or become active members of the community. The greatest tragedy is that these students are failed by the country that they love and forced overseas to earn enough to pay off the student loan burden.

Kindest Regards.

Adam Maynard MUSA President 2004
