Massey Science Students declare University a contagious fee zone

Science Students at Massey University facing a proposed 5 percent fee increase will today be quarantining the University registry building by cordoning it off with danger tape in an attempt to stop the spread of crippling fees raises.

“Fees are a disease that is crippling the New Zealand society and economy. Massey students will not tolerate the spread of fee increases at their University,” said Adam Maynard, President of the Massey University Students’ Association (MUSA).

“We need to quarantine the registry building to put a stop to fee rises and send a message to the University that preventing fee rises is the best step in the battle against the devastating impact of student debt.”

“Students at Victoria University have already been contaminated by a 4.8 percent fee increase for 2005 and Massey students will be fighting against similar contagious fee increases.”

“The local MP and Minister of Tertiary Education Steve Maharey should take note that many other countries have banned the spread of fees and user pays tertiary education,” said Maynard.

“Steve Maharey should ban fee increases and progressively reduce fees to ensure that the future of New Zealand in not infested with student debt.”

Students will be cordoning off the Massey University Palmerston North Registry at 12 pm Wednesday 29th September.
