Labour Student Policy a Small but Significant Step

Labour Student Support Policy a Small but Significant Step

  
Today’s announcement by the Labour Party that it would wipe the interest on student loans for graduates remaining in New Zealand has been welcomed by the Massey University Students’ Association.

Other policy announcements such as continued regulation of tertiary fees and a commitment to increasing living allowance eligibility are viewed as a step in the right direction, although the lack of detail is a concern. “We would like to see a firmer commitment to reigning in the real drivers of student debt, but we are pleased that Labour has recognised that last year’s promises have not yet been fulfilled,” said Iain Galloway, MUSA President.

“I still maintain that the best way to deal with student debt is to help students avoid the need to borrow in the first place. However, this is the most significant relief students and graduates have been offered in some time,” Mr Galloway said.
