Massey students furious with proposed fee increase

Massey students furious with proposed fee increase

Students at Massey University are furious that the University is recommending that student fees be raised by 5 percent for the majority of students.

“The University is showing complete disregard for students by proposing that fees are raised by the maximum amount possible,” said Adam Maynard, President of the Massey University Students’ Association (MUSA). “Students will fight this unnecessary cash grab.”

“This University has a large surplus, wastes millions of student money on pointless marketing campaigns and has the cheek to ask students to pay even more in 2005,” said Maynard.

At the New Zealand University Students’ Association conference over the weekend, Tertiary Minister Steve Maharey said that Massey students might have a “nice surprise” when it comes to fees setting.

“Steve Maharey should get his facts right and stop believing that our universities care about students when they have shown time and again that all they are interested in is squeezing more money from poor students,” said Maynard.

Massey Council will be meeting at 9.30 am this Friday to set fees. Massey students plan to rally on the concourse of the Palmerston North campus and deliver a petition calling for a zero fee increase.
