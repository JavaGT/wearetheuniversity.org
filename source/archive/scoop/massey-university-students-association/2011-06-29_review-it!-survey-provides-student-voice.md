The Review It! survey, developed by Massey University students’ associations, will go live for Massey internal students for the first time this semester.

“Review It! appears to be a world first in terms of a student run, ethics approved, public database of student views about their courses. The reviews students post will assist other students in making their university paper choices,” says Ralph Springett, the Massey University Students’ Association Federation coordinator.

Review It! asks students to review the paper(s) they have completed and make their review(s) available to future students. “There are the benefits of making more informed paper choices as well the recognized benefit of having the student reflect on their learning process,” says Mr Springett. “Additionally if a paper has problems the department can move quickly to improve things for future students.”

The Review It! pilot, trialled over the summer school, was the first major student led project to be funded by Ako Aotearoa, the National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence. “We were immediately excited by this project proposal,” Peter Coolbear, Director of Ako Aotearoa says, “Massey students’ associations are actively seeking to encourage students to provide quality advice to other students and to their university. I think this is hugely empowering for students and shows great mutual respect between the parties involved.”

Massey University, in supporting the survey, is demonstrating their confidence in the quality of their courses as well as the professionalism of their student associations. Assistant Vice Chancellor (Academic and International) Professor Ingrid Day emphasised the value of constructive student feedback and its role in continuous improvement. She added “We are pleased to support initiatives that enhance our capacity to receive and respond to student views and experiences, and to highlight our excellent teaching. Review It! offers great potential and we valued the opportunity to work together with our student associations in its development”

Review It! will inform student awards for Best Paper and Best Lecturer each year. “Students recognise good tuition, Review It! offers students the opportunity to say thank you to those delivering great learning experiences,” says Mr Springett.

The Review It! launch includes a humorous video produced by Nick Gibb, the recent winner of the prestigious Billy T James Yellow Towel award. “The video is something that younger students worldwide will relate to,” says Mr Springett,
