Massey Vet Students to be Hardest Hit by Fee Hike

Massey Vet Students to be Hardest Hit by Fee Hike

Massey University's Veterinary Science students stand to be the hardest hit by the proposed ten percent fee increase that will be presented to the Massey University Council this Friday, September 2nd.

With current annual fees of $6,771.00, Vet students face a thumping $678.00 increase each year that will result in a total bill of $37,254.00 in tuition fees alone upon completion.

Massey University Students' Association President Iain Galloway says that the extreme intensity of the Vet Science programme means that almost no Vet students find the time for part time work. "Since very few Vet students are eligible for a living allowance, they are forced to borrow the maximum possible to cover their rent and expenses. This increase in their tuition fees is just another attack on one of New Zealand's most valuable resources," he said.

The announcement that Massey University's senior management wish to add to their Vet students' burden comes just weeks after Prime Minister Helen Clark announced additional Government funding for years three, four and five of undergraduate Veterinary science. From 2006, the per Equivalent Full Time Student (EFTS) subsidy for years three, four and five will increase by $5,684.00 bringing the total funding to $24,582.00.

Ms Clark stated that "Veterinary science is an area of high strategic relevance in tertiary education and it is of key importance to supporting our primary industries."

Mr Galloway agrees saying, "Massey clearly has an obligation to the nation to support Veterinary students in every way possible. This example makes it obvious that across the board fee increases do not reflect the costs, requirements and strategic value of individual courses. Massey University management must do more to display a genuine need for this extraordinary leap in fee levels."
