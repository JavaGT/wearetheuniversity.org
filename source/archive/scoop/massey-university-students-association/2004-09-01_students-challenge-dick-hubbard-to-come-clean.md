Students challenge Dick Hubbard to come clean to Aucklanders on student fees

Students are challenging Massey University Council Member and Auckland Mayoral Candidate Dick Hubbard to make his position on student fees public so that Aucklanders know whether he will be student friendly mayor.

“Dick Hubbard should publicly oppose fee increases for Massey students for 2005 and take a stand against the destructive effects of student debt on our economy and society,” said Adam Maynard, President of the Massey University Students’ Association and Student Member of the Massey University Council.

“By saying no to fee increases, Dick Hubbard can show that he understands the experience of Auckland graduates, many of whom are saddled with massive student debts that they have little chance of repaying.”

“If Dick Hubbard insists on voting for fee increases and even more student debt, he will be sending a message to Aucklanders that he does not care about the brain drain, workforce shortages and declining fertility rates.”

“Students already know John Banks's position on student support, given his leadership role in the National government which oversaw fee increases of 12% a year on average during the nineties."

Dick Hubbard is a Court of Convocation representative on the Massey University Council, his term ends on the 31st of December 2006

“Massey students were incensed when Dick Hubbard voted for last year’s fee increase despite the University’s massive surplus,” said Adam Maynard “He should come clean about his position on fee increases for 2005 so that students and Auckland voters can know what he really stands for.”
