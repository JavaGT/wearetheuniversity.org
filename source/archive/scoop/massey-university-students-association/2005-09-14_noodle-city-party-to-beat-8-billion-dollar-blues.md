Noodle City Party to Beat the 8 Billion Dollar Blues

The residents of Noodle City will be partying from 2 pm onwards today to take their minds off the unfathomable enormity of the 8 billion dollars of student debt that was reached today.

“This is just so huge, it’s hard to get our heads around,” said Massey University Students’ Association President Iain Galloway. “How do you respond to 8 billion dollars of debt? How did New Zealand let itself get into this mess,” he asked.

To cheer the students up, Noodle City will be staging live music and other entertainment into the night and of course there will be noodles. Noodles for all. Mr Galloway said that San Remo had delivered several boxes of noodles to the protesting students, enough to keep Noodle City sustained for a long while yet.
