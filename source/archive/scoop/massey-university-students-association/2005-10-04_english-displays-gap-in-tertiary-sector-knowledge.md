English Displays Gap in Tertiary Sector Knowledge

Poor English Displays Gap in Tertiary Sector Knowledge

National Party Education spokesman Bill English today showed a glaring lack of knowledge about the Tertiary Sector when he stated that the proposed fee increase at Victoria University is “just the beginning.”

Massey University elected to apply for a ten percent exemption a full month before this week’s edition of student magazine Salient was embargoed because it was to run a story claiming that Victoria University planned to increase fees by a similar amount.

“Massey students were already predicting a follow-on effect of the fee-setting decision made here in September,” said Massey University Students’ Association President Iain Galloway. “Mr English clearly relies on media sensationalism for his information rather than ensuring he has a full brief of the issues arising in his portfolio.”
