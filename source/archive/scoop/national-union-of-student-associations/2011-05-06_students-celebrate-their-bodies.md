Students celebrate their bodies

Students celebrate their bodies

Students across the country today are celebrating International No Diet Day (INDD). Founded in 1992, INDD is a day to celebrate body diversity and forget about societal pressures.

“INDD remains necessary because the media, the medical community, family, friends, and society in general constantly send out the message that fat is ugly, unhealthy and something to lose at all costs. Discrimination in employment, healthcare, education and housing exists for large people. Large people face accessibility issues daily.” Says Caitlin Dunham, National Women’s Rights Officer for the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations “An estimated 9% of New Zealand female university students have or will have an eating disorder at some stage throughout their time at university.”

Auckland University Students’ Association is holding a fashion show to celebrate body diversity and fashion at all sizes. It is being held in the Quad at the City Campus from midday, with models ranging from sizes 6 - 24. Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association is hosting a dessert lunch with piñata from 3 -5 pm in the Student Union Building, while Albany Students’ Association is giving out ‘Love your Body’ cards with inspiration messages

“Eating disorders can affect anyone at any time, and have a direct negative impact on people’s ability to maintain tertiary study. International No Diet Day is a day where we can remember that there are more important things than body image and diets” concludes Dunham.
