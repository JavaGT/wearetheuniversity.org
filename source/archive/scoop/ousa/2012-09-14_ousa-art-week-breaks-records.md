**OUSA Art Week breaks records**

The 5th annual OUSA Art Week beginning on September 17 is breaking student art exhibition records with 200 pieces on display.

“Art Week keeps getting bigger and better, and this year is set to be no exception!” said Laura Madden, OUSA Events Manager. “It’s an opportunity for students and Dunedin to actively participate in the arts because this event has grown from a student event to become a true Dunedin event.”

The programme presents OUSA’s largest ever student art exhibition and sale, showcasing 200 vibrant works available to view and buy in the University’s Link mezzanine. With the support of the University, there is also a number of special art on campus installations to view in a variety of different locations, and popular events like the White Night gallery crawl, artist-writer speed dating making a welcome return, and exciting new interactive projects.

“This year the student art exhibition is looking to be huge with a record number of exhibitors entering work to show the public and students,” said Madden, “It’s a great way to pick up great art and support the students who have entered works.”

There are plenty of free activities planned including daily activities such as Art Daily which brings a new artist on campus creating original work each day, and the contemporary installations throughout the campus as part of a longer term Art on Campus project with the University of Otago and the Blue Oyster Gallery.

“The Art Week team are running an Art Scavenger Hunt taking people around Dunedin as well as the campus to find our hidden art gems,” said Madden, “But for those wanting a concentrated shot of art we’ve also got the White Night Gallery crawl showing off Dunedin’s galleries in a one night, Dunedin event.”

It’s the second year OUSA has teamed up the Blue Oyster crew and local art galleries to run the White Night gallery crawl. It’s an evening where the public and students can browse the selection of galleries within the Dunedin CBD which stay open late with food and refreshments as they show off their flavour of artists to all students and Dunedin public that are keen on a slightly more different night out than the usual crawl!

The full programme listing all events and including the Art Hunt questions is available here.
