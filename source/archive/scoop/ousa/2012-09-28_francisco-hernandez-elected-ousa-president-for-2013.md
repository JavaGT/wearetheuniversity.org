**Francisco Hernandez Elected OUSA President for 2013**

This week the students of Otago University voted Francisco Hernandez, a current Masters student, into the leadership role for the 2013 year.

"I am excited about the challenge, "said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President Elect 2013, "I want to thank all the students that voted for me and I promise to work for all students.”

“The OUSA is in good hands for 2013," Said Logan Edgar, OUSA President.

But students weren't just voting for their new OUSA student executive representatives, they were voting to give the nation a finger on the pulse of student opinion. Over 3,000 students this week put forward their opinions on two of the nations hot topics; the sale of state owned energy companies, and same sex marriage.

Student opinion was obvious with voters 63% in favour of OUSA opposing the sale of the electricity companies, and 84% in favour of supporting same sex marriage.

“Students have spoken and the OUSA will faithfully push their views forward,” said Hernandez.

Other hot topics such as whether OUSA should support the University going smoke-free and whether or not OUSA should actively support pushing for postgraduate students to receive a student allowance also received support from the majority of voters.

The OUSA 2013 Executive will take charge of OUSA on the 1st of January 2013 after a handover and induction with the current Executive.
