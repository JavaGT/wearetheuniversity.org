OUSA Letting the Cat Out of the Bag for Students

The Otago University Students’ Association is teaming up with the Otago Polytechnic’s Veterinary Nursing School and local vets to run a cat clinic for students of Otago this Friday the 26th of July. Over 60 feline Scarfie friends will be given their very own student care package, an offer which was snapped up within three days of registrations being opened.

“We’re providing the opportunity for students to get a cheap check-up and registration for their cats while getting advice from professionals they may not usually be able to afford.” Said Lucy Gaudin, OUSA Animal Welfare Officer, “For twenty dollars the cats will receive a check-up, micro chipping and registration, deworming, first stage vaccination, and a goodie bag with products from one of our sponsors, Nutro.”

“A big part of our program focuses on responsible pet ownership. Dunedin has a serious problem with wild cats as well as adopted cats that are not looked after. By providing cheap micro chipping and registration, any pets that are lost or left behind can be reunited, and any owners found to be neglecting their pet can be followed up by the SPCA.”

As part of the process, each owner must nominate a vet clinic to provide any ongoing care. The goodie bags also contain information regarding the various desexing options available.

“The event wouldn’t be happening without the support of Nutro, Virbac, Otago SPCA, Otago School of Veterinary Nursing and the amazing vets and vet nurses from Green Island, Dunedin South, Gardens, Helensborough and Mosgiel Vet clinics.” Said Ms. Gaudin, “We’re thrilled with the amount of vet clinic staff who are giving up their time to help out on the day and think they deserve a round of ‘a-paws’.”

The inaugural event is being set up with a plan to carry it on in 2014.

Students and the Dunedin public that find a stray are advised to get in touch with the SPCA or Dunedin Cat Rescue so they can be taken off the streets and ideally rehomed.
