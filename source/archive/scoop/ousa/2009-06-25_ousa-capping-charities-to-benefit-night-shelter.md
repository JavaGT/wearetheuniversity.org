Dunedin Night Shelter, Girls Guides Group to benefit as OUSA Capping Charities

The Dunedin Night Shelter and the Girl Guides Otago (Cargill District) are this year’s Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) capping charities.

Each organisation will receive half proceeds each from lost property sales and donations made to the OUSA offices in 2009.

“In choosing these charities, we looked at ways we could best serve the Dunedin community. The Dunedin Night Shelter is a vital service to those who find themselves temporarily homeless” said OUSA President, Edwin Darlow, “while the Girl Guides supports the aspirations of young local women.”

OUSA is also planning to assist each organisation in their own fundraising efforts, where it is practicable to do so, through giving them access to students and the University community. The Association is currently selling guide girl biscuits from its main office in Cumberland Street.

“OUSA is pleased to be associated with both organisations in 2009” Said Mr Darlow.
