OUSA VSM Protest Debrief
========================

**Friday, 5 August 2011, 8:01 pm**  
**Press Release: [OUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/OUSA)**

For Immediate Release

Today, students from the University of Otago took to the streets as part of a peaceful protest led by the Otago University Students’ Association. Prime Minister John Key, the target of the protest, was in Dunedin for the opening of the new Robertson Library, part of the University of Otago’s College of Education. The event was attended by representatives from the Labour and Green Parties as well as NZUSA Co President David Do.

After being presented with an ‘I love OUSA’ t-shirt, Mr. Key indicated a willingness to talk to the protesters, but upon emerging from the library was bundled straight into a waiting car, to the dismay of the waiting students.

Logan Edgar, President of the OUSA said “It’s all about the scarfie spirit! I’m proud of OUSA, the OUSA staff, Executive and most importantly our students standing together to show John Key that we do not want VSM!”

OUSA demands that the National Party listen to these students and the 98% of submissions both of which clearly showed that Otago students do not want the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill to pass.

Katie Reid, Education Officer and University Council member was thrilled with the protest “This really shows that students are unwilling to have the Government ignore their views.”

Shonelle Eastwood, Welfare Officer says “Students are disappointed that the National Party are taking away our choice with this Bill and refusing to listen to the student voice.”

Sarah Louise Van Bellekom, Recreation Portfolio Executive and Chief protest leader: “Fuck, we go good.”

The OUSA would like to thank all the students, public and local political representatives that attended! CHEERS!

Have a good weekend all!
