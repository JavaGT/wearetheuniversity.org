For Immediate Release

  
Students Still Keen for Extra Work

Student Job Search’s latest figures show that while students placed in work are earning more and working longer, the number of jobs for students is down.

“The numbers show more students are signing up, we just need more businesses and the public to get on board and advertise jobs when they need a bit of extra help,” said Logan Edgar OUSA President, “It’s such a good service and being free for both students and advertisers it’s an easy option.”

Figures show student earnings are up 60% on average to just over $2000, and worker weeks and enrolls are up 24% and 30% respectively, but students placed in work is down 19% to 1,314.

“It shows students are keen to work, SJS just needs employers to get in touch,” says Mr. Edgar. “SJS and students are flexible, it could be one off or part time, they’re keen for the opportunity to get out and gain experience as well as earning some extra money.”
