Women's Week At OUSA
====================

Women's Week At OUSA

This week at OUSA is an important one for New Zealand and Otago, it’s Women’s Week! Throughout the week we have a variety of women’s focused events; free Yoga and Kendo, guest speakers and the very first Dunedin Slutwalk.

The free recreation classes are open to all Otago University students, and the Dunedin public is invited along to hear the guest speaker Kris Smith from the Tertiary Education Union to talk about ”The Effect of MMP on Women.” The Lecture will be held Thursday 11th August at 12:00pm in the Women’s Room on campus.

Timed to coincide with OUSA Women’s Week, the Dunedin Slut Walk is part of an international protest series created in response to a Toronto police officer telling a group of women that they should stop dressing like "sluts" to avoid being raped.

Slut Walk calls for an end to victim blaming. Statistically, what you wear puts you at no higher risk of victimisation. Violence does not discriminate.

After a successful international movement, SlutWalk has finally reached the streets of Dunedin, The Dunedin Slutwalk will consist of a walk and a rally. Women, men, children of all different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and gender identities will gather at 12:00 PM at The Dunedin Museum Lawn and walk down George St. to the Octagon where there will be music, speakers, dancing and stalls.

Shonelle Eastwood, OUSA Welfare Officer says, “I am proud to support the Dunedin Slut Walk. One out of four University aged women have been sexually assaulted or raped and it is important to dispel the myths surrounding victim blaming, people don’t get raped because of what they wear, it’s as simple as that.”

‘We are really excited about the march because victim-blaming is far too common in our community,’ said Georgia Knowles, the Rape Crisis Dunedin Community Education Worker and one of the creators of Slutwalk Dunedin, ‘The event is a good way to raise awareness and challenge damaging ideas around rape; the focus of the Dunedin Slutwalk is to emphasise a person’s right to be free from violence regardless of what they wear or how they act.’

The walk will start at 12:00pm from the museum and end in the Octagon at 12:30pm for music and speakers. Everyone is welcome, dress how you like and come along to support this international event.
