OUSA: Re-Orientation and VSM
============================

**Tuesday, 12 July 2011, 4:38 pm**  
**Press Release: [OUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/OUSA)**

### **OUSA Re-Orientation and VSM**

**For Immediate Release**

This Re-Orientation week OUSA welcomes back students from around New Zealand and the world. We have a sweet line up of entertainment featuring; international musicians, paint party pandemonium, Roller Derby destruction and international gastronomic delights!

**_Wednesday_**  
Wednesday shows off the OUSA Clubs Day where students and the public can come along to the Union Hall to check out the clubs and courses affiliated with our Clubs and Societies. It’s the perfect time to meet like-minded people and get a taste for the clubs we have on offer.

There’s also a wild Wednesday night on the cards, and we’re amped to welcome back the Night Cap crew returning to smash out another epic party at the Union Hall! This year they’re bringing 16-Bit fresh from the UK, Light Year from Australia, and our very own Alphabethead, along with Drum&Bass duo The Upbeats supported by the lyrical skill of the UK’s MC Lowqui.

**_Thursday_**  
The Dunedin rain has made its mark already on our Thursday of activities, with the Carnival on Campus CANCELLED due to the weather, but we will continue with the OUSA Market Day, the International Food Festival and the Dunedin Derby showing off their Roller Derby in the Union Hall! Throughout the day we’ll have bands and we’ll make sure the MCR is nice and warm too!

To feed the masses and take us out of our culinary comfort zone, we have the International Food Festival brought to you by OUSA and 15 of our International Clubs and Associations. Each year it gets bigger and this year we have presale tokens ($1 and $5) available from OUSA (including Clubs and Societies reception) from Monday 11th of July as well as on the night from OUSA and the Events Ticketing Window from 6.30pm.

For the first time on show in public, the Dunedin Derby, our local roller derby girls will be coming to the Union Hall to show off an exclusive Demo-Derby showcasing their skills and guaranteed spills! To finish off the night they follow up their 9.00pm exhibition with an after party in Re:Fuel from 10pm with local acts including the Black Rock Coffin Makers and more.

**_Saturday_**  
Come Saturday night we welcome back the Illuminate Paint party, last year the Union hall packed out and got a fresh look with paint been squirted and hurled by the crowd. This year they come back promising more paint, more mess, and more fun, with a paint slide, paint turrets and hand held paint guns!

**Coming Up – The OUSA Presidential Prison**

For two nights from 7pm Monday the 18th, OUSA President Logan Edgar will be locking himself in his “Presidential Prison” to protest the VSM (Freedom of Association Amendment Bill) currently awaiting further debate in parliament.

Logan plans to spend two nights in a cage (in the cold) on the Union Lawn until 7pm Wednesday the 20th of July. Logan’s lock in coincides with one of the final dates that the Bill could be passed by parliament before the election, and he is determined to promote to the nation how the bill will affect the services provided by OUSA and other student associations throughout New Zealand. The aim is to have all University campuses around the country linked up with Logan via a 24hour a day webcam in a ‘happy feet’ style set up, and projector screens in all their major campus hubs to promote the issue.

Logan says, “The government hasn’t listened to the 98% of submissions that opposed the bill.” He goes on to say, “The government are locking us out and not listening, so I’m locking myself in to make a stand. I’ll be in the cage until John Campbell turns up,” he then jokingly added, “but it’s OK if it’s a bad time of the month for him, we’re a diverse and accepting bunch down here at OUSA.”
