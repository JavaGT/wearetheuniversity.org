FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OUSA presents: Dunedin’s Next Top Flat

  
Four of the best and three of the worst student flats have been shortlisted for this year’s Dunedin’s Next Top Flat competition.

“The contest both celebrates the best and highlights the worst of student flats” said Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) president Harriet Geoghegan. “Landlords will also come in for some examination – how much do landlords contribute to making a good or bad flat?”

The judging team comprises Geoghegan, OUSA Welfare Officer Claire Jackson, Adele Evans from the University’s Accommodation Office, and the following candidates in the Dunedin City Council local body elections: Jinty MacTavish, Jono Clark, Andrew Eames, and Aaron Hawkins.

“It’s important to us that the Dunedin City Council is aware of how students live here in the student ghetto“ said Claire Jackson, “our contestants show how students work together to make the best of their flats. We’re not completely sure what we’re going to find with our three worst flat finalists, however!”

The contest replaces OUSA’s previous House and Garden and Landlord of the Year contests.

Judging takes place from this Friday September 25 at 1pm. The best flat will win prizes of grocery vouchers, while the worst flat will get a professional flat clean.

A list of entries/ addresses is available on request; media are welcome to come and look at the flats along with the judges!
