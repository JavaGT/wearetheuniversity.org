OUSA’s Biggest Battle (of the Bands)

OUSA has received over a third more entries than usual for its annual Battle of the Bands contest, garnering 43 entries this year.

“We had reached our usual total late last week” said OUSA Events Coordinator Dan Hendra, “yet on the last day for entries yesterday, people just kept coming in.”

OUSA is delighted at the response and has no plans to cut down any of the entries.

“There are four heats over four nights” said Hendra, “and we will squeeze everyone in. We don’t want a single band to miss out on this fantastic opportunity to compete.”

Most bands fall in the usual genres (rock, punk, metal) but there are some more unusual kinds of music for judges to grapple with this year – ‘porngroove’, progressive metal, “punk-ska-reggae”, “Alec Baldwin” all feature on the list.

The OUSA Battle of the Bands heats take place at Refuel on campus over the nights of May 07, May 14, May 21 and May 28 with the Final on Saturday May 29.

Doors open 8pm, bands start sharp at 8:30pm  
Each band has 10 minutes to impress the judges

Running since the mid-‘90s, OUSA’s Battle of the Bands takes place during New Zealand Music Month, entry to the venue is free, and the audience is guaranteed an interesting and varied night of local Dunedin music.
