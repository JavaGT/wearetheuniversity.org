The best and worst of Dunedin Flatting

OUSA Next Top Flat Competition – The best and worst of Dunedin Flatting

  
The OUSA Welfare Officer, Shonelle Eastwood, has announced the final winner of the OUSA Dunedin’s Next Top Flat competition.

Top Flats:

Best Flat: 543/5 George Street

Worst Flat: 49 Brown Street

Greenest Flat: 8A Beaconsfield Road

Special Mentions:

Best Landlord: 120/5 London Street

Worst Tenants: 402 Leith Street

  
“Dunedin’s Next Top Flat competition highlights the best and worst in Dunedin flats. It’s made up of great tenants, great landlords and on the other extreme shows how bad landlords and bad tenants can make flatting in Dunedin that extra bit difficult.” Says Shonelle.

  
“Judges were blown away by the state of some flats, both with sub par landlords and tenants.” Says Eastwood; “ We were relieved when we got to check out the Top Flat entrants who were backed up by great landlords and students making the most of flatting in Dunedin.”

  
The Best flat this year was not only a great quality flat it was also run by a group of students that were devoted to being great flatmates to each other, and also looking after their flat. They’ll receive $150 of supermarket vouchers to keep them stocked up!

  
On the other hand, the Worst flat wasn’t let down by tenants but rather by being allowed to fall into disrepair, truly disappointing for any flat in Dunedin but especially due to it’s high profile as the Scarfies flat. The flat will receive commercial cleaning or supermarket vouchers to help them out too.

“OUSA is focused on improving the conditions of flats in Dunedin and we believe it comes from both sides.” Says Eastwood; “The onus is on both students and landlords to make sure flats are being looked after, and we encourage any students needing advice about their flatting situation to contact OUSA Student Support.”

  
OUSA wishes to thank all entrants and guest judges Gareth Hughes (Green MP), Adele Evans (Otago University Accommodation Office), Jinty MacTavish (local Councillor) and Dunedin City Deputy Mayor Chris Staynes.

  
We look forward to making OUSA Next Top Flat BIGGER and BETTER next year, and keep an eye out for the new Land Lord of the Year competition!
