**Sporting basics focus of University Games 2013**

The Otago University Students’ Association will lead the management of the University Sport New Zealand University Games 2013 to be held in Dunedin between April 22 – 24 2013.

“The University Games 2013 will be a back to basics sports focused event”, said OUSA Recreation Officer and Chair of the Otago Uni Games Organising Committee, Blake Luff. “We’ve got great support from sports faculties at the University and the Polytechnic along with the University’s Unipol Recreation Services and the OUSA Recreation Centre. In addition the Dunedin City Council will support the event.”

The Event Manager will be Otago Polytechnic Senior Lecturer Geoff Simons. Mr. Simons performed this role for the previous two successful University Gamesevents in Dunedin and has been the Sport Liaison Coordinator for the NZ Masters Games for the last three times in Dunedin.

“The Uni Games will see a testing competition and it’s a good chance to meet students from around the country.” Said Luff, “We’re all looking forward to having a bit of fun to help recharge the academic batteries!”
