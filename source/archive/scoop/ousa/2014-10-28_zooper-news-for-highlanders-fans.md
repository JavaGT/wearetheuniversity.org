‘Zooper’ news for Highlanders fans

‘Zooper’ news for Highlanders fans

  
The OUSA is thrilled to announce the 2015 Zooper Pass which will give students the chance to attend all five home games for The Highlanders’ at the Forsyth Barr Stadium.

The ‘Zooper’ pass is a new addition to the Orientation Super Pass which are largely snapped up by first year students. Numbers will be limited to 2000 and available only with the purchase of the Orientation Super Pass.

OUSA has worked closely with The Highlanders to create a deal that will encourage new students to attend The Highlanders’ home games and maximise the use of the infamous Zoo at Forsyth Barr Stadium.

“We would love to see the Zoo full each game, students help to create the unique atmosphere at Highlanders games at Forsyth Barr Stadium and I know this motivates the players out on the grass,” says Highlanders General Manager, Roger Clark. “We see our events as a safe environment where they can enjoy the full student experience that comes with attending the University of Otago”.

With the current price of an individual game at $15, students who purchase the ‘Zooper’ pass will be able to attend five games for the price of two.

OUSA President-elect Paul Hunt strongly supports the relationship and the opportunity that it gives to students to watch top quality rugby.

“It’s a great way for freshers to experience Dunedin’s world class stadium and enjoy a bit of code. Sitting in the Zoo is a traditional Scarfie past-time which has continued from the days when students packed Carisbrook’s terraces.”

Individual student Zoo tickets for home games will also be sold from OUSA office on campus during the season.
