Otago Students Crack $4 Million
===============================

**Otago Students Crack $4 Million**

Otago students have passed the $4 million mark in earnings for 2012 after gaining jobs listed through the Student Job Search service. The web based service is governed and provided by student associations around the country and provides a free way to connect students with employers.

“It’s awesome to see the free service bringing in so much extra money and experience for students,” says Logan Edgar, OUSA President, “It shows that when it’s made easy both employers and students can make the most of the service. To us SJS is a win-win, good for our members and the local economy.”

Total student earnings are up 49%, which is almost $700,000 more than the same time in 2011. Worker weeks increased by 16%, meaning students are working longer even though the number placed in work was down by 19%.

“Placements are still an issue as the number placed in work is down,” said Edgar, “That could be due to a number of reasons including; employers not being aware of the service, or just the fact that there’s already of lot of people looking for work in Dunedin so employers are finding non students to fill the gaps.”

“The exciting thing is that more and more students are enrolling with the service to try and find work,” said Edgar, “Now all we need is for more employers to take a look at the service and give listing a shot.”
