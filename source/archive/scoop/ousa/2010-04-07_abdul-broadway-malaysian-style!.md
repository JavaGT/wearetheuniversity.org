**“**3 Abdul**” Broadway – Malaysian Style!**

The OUSA affiliated Otago Malaysian Students’ Association presents “3 Abdul”, a night filled with cultural performances that are colourful and vibrant!

Our Otago Malaysian Students Association annual cultural night is something different this year: we bring Broadway to you, Malaysian style.

Take a look into Malaysia’s popular ‘60s culture with songs from the great film legend, P Ramlee.

The main course of the night will be a remake of a famous P Ramlee film called _3 Abdul_. It’s about three brothers who inherited a huge amount of wealth from their deceased father but everything went sorely wrong with the arrival of a beautiful woman. So what will happen to the brothers? Who’s this beautiful woman? Find out at OMSA’s Malaysian Cultural Night!

Get your family and friends to join us and experience the Malaysian culture like you’ve never experienced before!

“It will be a great event” says OUSA International Students’ Officer Art Kojarunchitt, “We’re starting off the International Cultural Council calendar year with some Malaysian culture. Members of the public are very welcome to attend”

“3 Abdul” will take place in the Teachers’ College Auditorium at 7 pm on Saturday 17th April 2010.  
Tickets are $5 for Members and $8 for Non-members.  
There will be a flat rate of $8 door sale on the night itself.  
Tickets will be on sale at Hunter Centre on Wednesday (14th April) and Union foyer on Thursday (15th April) from 12-2pm, or email iso@ousa.org.nz for RSVP.  
Members of the public can buy at the door or by contacting Art directly.
