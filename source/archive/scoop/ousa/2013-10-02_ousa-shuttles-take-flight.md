OUSA Shuttles Take Flight

**OUSA Shuttles Take Flight**

The Otago University Students’ Association has announced it will be trialling a twelve dollar student airport shuttle service for the end of year examination period between 11th of October and 11th of November.

“One of my promises was to get students a cheaper option for airport transportation, and this service achieves that.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “The OUSA Shuttle Service will provide students with a guaranteed flat rate of twelve dollars without relying on the discount of other passengers also taking the shuttle.”

The OUSA service will be running eight shuttles a day from two locations from North Road in North East Valley and outside the OUSA Main Office on Cumberland Street. Airport arrival times have been linked with the check in times of the main flights from Dunedin Airport with the first shuttle pick-ups starting at 5.15 am and the final leaving at 6.15pm.

“We’ve made the service simple with a flat rate, designated pick up times, simple departure locations, and it’s all paid online so students can lock in their time and just turn up.” Said Hernandez, “For us it’s about making an easy system where students can just book, turn up and go. And if money’s a bit tight because you haven’t got your bond back yet, maybe even the folks can chip in for it by booking online.”

The service has been set up by OUSA who has secured an external shuttle provider who will be running services from North Dunedin to the Dunedin airport, a 30km trip that usually costs upwards of $20 for a single student.

Students looking to book will be able to do so via www.studentshuttles.co.nz with the website expected to be up by the 9th of October in time for the first bookings.

Airport shuttles will be available for all tertiary students.
