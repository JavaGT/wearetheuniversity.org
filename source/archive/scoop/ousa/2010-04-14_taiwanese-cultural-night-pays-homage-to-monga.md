“Taiwanese Cultural Night pays homage to MONGA”

‘Monga’ – the hottest film in Taiwan right now – provides the inspiration for the Taiwanese Cultural Night.

Within this theme, attendees will experience indigenous Taiwanese dance (choreographed by Jali Shen); a ballet performance performed by a professional dancer accompanied by professional cellist playing Taiwanese music; contemporary hip hop dance; and the final round of a karaoke contest.

“You can expect something different and we guarantee you will see something you would never have seen before” says Andrew Yin, President of the OUSA affiliated Otago Taiwanese Students’ Association.

Taiwanese Cultural Night takes place in the University Teachers’ College Auditorium at 7 pm on Saturday 24th April 2010.  
Tickets are $6 for Members and $8 for Non-members.  
Door sales $10 for all.
