==============================

**Press Release: [OUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/OUSA)**

**OUSA Art Week: September 16-20**

The Otago University Students’ Association is proud to announce our annual Art Week. The event aims to bring vibrancy to the campus through a range of events, with the feature of the week being the 25th annual Student Art Exhibition and Sale held in Union Hall.

“Art Week aims to expose students and the Dunedin public to the wonderful world of student art, and provide a platform for our students to show their work.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “For OUSA it’s one of our key events that bring together both the public and students and get them interacting positively like the Dunedin Craft Beer & Food Festival, and the International Food Festival.”

“This year we are also including established artists who are both past and present students, Jessica Crothall, Browyn Robson and Maggie Covell, to show at the 25th annual Student Art Exhibition and Sale.” Said Rachel Enright, OUSA Event Coordinator, “Having these artists on board means we have an even greater range of art on show and allows those entering for the first time to see where their passion can take them.”

The week-long event grows in participation and interest each year, with a range of both day and night time events located both on campus and around Dunedin as the very popular White Night Gallery Crawl again makes its way around thirteen Dunedin galleries during the Thursday evening. _More information can be found on page 2._

The Blue Oyster Art Project Space on Moray place have been long supporters of the OUSA Art Week, Gallery Administrator and past OUSA Art Week curator, Briar Holt says, “The Blue Oyster loves to be a part of the OUSA art week. It’s great to have students coming through the doors and being part of events like the ever popular White Night gallery crawl – always a highlight in our calendar”.

Other popular events that have proven popular each year include the Artist-Writer speed dating which brings together artists and writers for potential collaborations, and the Pecha Kucha night in which 12 speakers talk to 20 slides for 20 seconds each telling a variety of personal stories.

“Art is such a vast concept and we’re lucky to have a diverse range of events and artists on board that will allow students and the public to experience something new and different,” said Miss. Enright.

**White Night Thursday 19th September**

White Night is an evening where galleries from Dunedin leave their doors open in the evening from 5pm all closing at various times up to 8.30pm. White Night has been around for years with its name coming from the fact that galleries are blank white canvases for art to be seen upon.
