Otago students collect for RSA

Twenty Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) volunteers took part in the Poppy Day appeal today as part of the OUSA Volunteer Week.

“We collected $698.90 which is a good lead into our first ever remembrance service on campus this Anzac Day,” said Logan Edgar OUSA President.

“The response is part of a trend for this generation to want to thank those who stepped up, left their families and travelled across the globe to risk their lives for the sake of others” said Edgar.

“It’s about sacrifice, remembrance and hope,” said Mr. Edgar.

This Anzac Day the OUSA along with the Otago University will be holding a special ANZAC remembrance at 1.30 pm, the first of its kind on the campus.

“It is going to be very special and unlike any other around Otago in that it will focus on opening the service to the next generation of our young people,” said Mr. Edgar.

The 1.30pm service on April 25th is driven by the young student who believes that this is a generation that wants to remember those who served for the future of their families and their country.

A piper will welcome attendees and Mr. Edgar will begin the service with Lisa Pohatu, Tumuaki, of Te Roopu Maori. University Chaplain Greg Hughson will share the opening prayer. During the service there will be a gun salute, the last post and one minute’s silence. Vice Chancellor Harlene Hayne will share a reading, and the speaker will be Lt. Colonel Mike Hunter.

The ceremony will be concluded by the laying of the wreaths by University staff and OUSA representatives.

All students, staff and public are welcome to attend and partake in refreshments after the completion of the service.
