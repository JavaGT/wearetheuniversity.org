**Otago Student Earnings up 25%**

The latest figures from student association governed Student Job Search show that the free service has got Otago students into jobs that has led to a 25% increase in Otago student earnings over the past two years.

\"It's great news to see that students who are balancing study and their bank balance have earned more over the past two years," said Logan Edgar, OUSA President. "It shows Otago student earnings are outperforming inflation which is a great sign as it shows Otago students are worth their weight in gold, well maybe blue and gold in our case."

SJS figures show that in 2010 students earned NZD $3,349,530. That figure ballooned to NZD $3,889,317 in 2011 and rose another 9% to 4,234,467 in 2012.

"The service is getting more and more students signing up each year, and the figures show that when they're placed they're worth it because they're both earning and working more," said Edgar. "I encourage anyone looking to employ an extra staff member, to look at the free service SJS provides. It's not just about the money, it's about experience and helping give students a taste of the real world."
