**OUSA Student Elections see 300% increase in Voting**

Last night the winners of the OUSA Elections were announced after a voting period that saw a 300% increase in voter numbers compared to the 2010 elections. This year saw a peak of 3590 students voting and all referendum questions being passed.

“The voter turnout was really good.” said Donna Jones, OUSA Secretary, ”We believe that students this year have realised the importance of the services OUSA provides, and increased voter turn out has shown they want to have their say and make sure our services are in the best hands.”

President: Logan Edgar 68.36%  
Admin Vice President: Art Kojarunchitt 68.26%  
Finance and Services Officer: Ryan Edgar 44.31%  
Welfare Officer: Francisco Herndandez 62.78%  
Education Officer: Aaspreet Boparai 70.04%  
Recreation Officer: Blake Luff 45.91%  
Colleges and Comms: Ryan Edgar 65.13% (Ryan will choose only 1 position)  
Postgraduate Representative: Victoria Koszowski 89.33%

“I’m stoked I’ve been voted back in again.” Says Logan Edgar, who returns as President for 2012 in a landslide victory, “Even with VSM now confirmed we’re going to work with the university to make sure Otago University stays the BEST place to study in New Zealand.”

“The turn out shows your typical student is taking more of an interest in the way their association is run.” Says Edgar, ”Thanks to glowing results for our services such as Recreation, Student Support, Events, Critic and Student Job Search from our 2010 student survey we’ll all be working to make sure these services stay strong for our students.”
