**$7 Million Earned by Otago Students in 2011**

Otago University Students’ Association today announced that the 2011 year saw their students earn almost $7 million dollars thanks to student governed and funded Student Job Search.

OUSA President Logan Edgar was positive about the services benefits to his members saying, “It caps off a great year for SJS and our members - being only $8,000 away from 7 million is a great achievement. This year we’ll push it even harder!”

“The close to $7m achievement shows that students are good workers. However, the OUSA would like to see a few more jobs come in this January as there are still students looking for work”, Mr. Edgar said.

The new online system Student Job Search will be using to connect with students and employees is planned to roll out early March. In the interim students are still able to use the current website and the SJS Connect Kiosks located at the OUSA offices which are open now.
