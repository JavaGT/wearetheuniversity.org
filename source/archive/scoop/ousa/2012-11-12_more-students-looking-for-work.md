**More Students Looking For Work**

Today the Otago University Students' Association announced the latest figures from Student Job Search show the number of students enrolling to look for work is up 42% on the same time last year. The SJS figures show that 3,511 student have enrolled between the period 1/1/12 to 31/10/12 compared to 2474 in the same period during 2011.

\"While it's great that students are using the service it's also a grim picture of how tough students are doing it financially." Said Logan Edgar, OUSA President, "We really do encourage anyone looking for extra workers whether it's part time or just a one off to try the free service to list a job."

The figures also show that the numbers of students placed in work during 2012 is down 13% compared to 2011.

"The latest unemployment figures show it's tough out there for everyone, but it's important the public see the opportunity SJS offers for one off and part time employment needs." Said Mr. Edgar, "Students are now going into summer holidays so there's a real opportunity for the public and private sectors to make the most of the students' break and at the same time give them extra experience to add to their CVs."

The OUSA and student associations around the country govern the free SJS service, and 80% of those student surveyed in the latest OUSA research said that SJS is an important or very important service provided by OUSA. Listing a job on the SJS service is free and easy, all that's needed is to register on the website and follow the step by step instructions at www.sjs.co.nz
