The Student Job Market Slump
============================

_**For immediate Release**_

**The Student Job Market Slump**

The latest figures from Student Job Search show that tough times are getting tougher for Otago University students looking for part time work while they study. Enrolments are up 24 percent from 2012 at 724 from 583, and those lucky enough to find work are earning on average 11 percent more but that’s where the good news ends for the service and students.

“With figures getting lower during January and February, we are concerned at the lack of available jobs to supplement the already limited incomes available to students,” said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President.

The number of students placed in work has slumped, down 15 percent from 2012. Weeks worked has also taken a 4 percent hit from 3,609 to 3,449 in the first few months

“More students are needing extra work after post graduate student allowance cuts have reduced the income of a full time post graduate student to the amount that can be borrowed via the student loan scheme,” said Hernandez.

Reduced numbers of students being placed in work has also seen the total earnings for students down 5 percent for the year from $1,657,858 to $1,569,297.

“After a bumper year in 2012 we’re predicting more students needing work and our greatest fear is that even with a free job service there won’t be the jobs there for them,” said Hernandez. “Education should be within reach of all Kiwis, and right now it’s looking like students without a wealthy background might not have the same opportunities to make that attainable.”
