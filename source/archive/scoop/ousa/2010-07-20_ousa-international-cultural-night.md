OUSA International Cultural Night
=================================

Otago University Students’ Association

Media Release  
20 July 2010

  
OUSA International Cultural Night

The Otago Community Hospice will be the beneficiary of OUSA’s International Cultural Night being held this Saturday.

“International students at Otago University see the International Cultural Night as their contribution to the Dunedin community that takes them to their hearts while they are here. All proceeds are donated to the Hospice.” says Art Kojarunchitt, OUSA International Students’ Officer.

Sponsored by ANZ bank and supported by the Dunedin City Council, the Cultural Night will give Dunedin a show that is vibrant and entertaining, a mix of traditional culture and very modern interpretations.

Among the fourteen performances are the popular local Bollywood-style group Khaas, the return of the Japanese Fishermen’s Dance, a traditional dance from Uyghur, and the latest in Korean pop music.

“The show is completely family-friendly” says Art Kojarunchitt, “everyone who comes will have a great night.”

While international clubs regularly have individual cultural performances, this is the only time each year so many groups will come together in one evening.

OUSA’s International Cultural Night begins at 6:45pm at the Dunedin Town Hall this Saturday (July 24). Tickets are $8 (individual) and $20 (a family of 2 adults and 2 children).

Tickets are available from OUSA’s Main Office at 640 Cumberland Street, and from the door on the night.
