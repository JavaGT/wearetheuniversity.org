========================================================

**Press Release: [OUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/OUSA)**

Morning! Happy New Year!

  
Below is the final announcement of the line up for OUSA's Orientadium MMXII orientation events.

OUSA is proud to announce Shapshifter, Shihad and David Dallas to headline

  
**ORIENTADIUM MMXII**

February 20-25, 2012

  
This February, OUSA take over the brand new Forsyth Barr Stadium to present the biggest Orientation Week the country has ever seen, hosting top flight New Zealand music legends **Shapeshifter, Shihad, David Dallas** along with well known support acts such as **Cairo Knife Fight, Home Brew** and **Sunshine Sound System.**

  
“Otago University is known for having the best mix of top notch study and fun.” says OUSA President Logan Edgar. “Our team has sorted out the ultimate student stadium experience, and we’re ready to host the biggest O Week in New Zealand ever!”

  
OUSA Events Manager Kitty Brown says she is delighted to take advantage of such a great new venue for Orientadium MMXII. “We’re using Forsyth Barr Stadium as much as we can with the West Stand being used for seating during the comedy and hypnotist shows, and the East Stand will have the seats removed to make a huge dance floor for the live music shows”.

  
**Shapeshifter** are unquestionably New Zealand’s greatest drum and bass act, their live shows are an unmissable staple for a Kiwi summer and OUSA is making sure Dunedin gets their share this summer along with support from mainlanders **Sunshine Sound System** and **Nightshade**. On the back of touring in Europe and releases on the legendary UK based Hospital Records, Shapeshifter are exploding internationally and they’re back in Dunedin on Saturday 25th of February ensuring Orientadium MMXII is an O week not to be outdone.

**Shihad** have been forging their reputation as this country’s greatest stadium rock outfit since before most Otago undergraduates were even born, and they will be mining their two-decades-plus back catalogue at Orientadium MMXII. Add to that **Cairo Knife Fight** and Dunedin’s own **Knives at Noon** and you’ve got a Rock n Roll lesson so good it should be made compulsory.

  
Hip-hop heroism abounds when Harlem-based superstar **David Dallas** brings his full live band to Dunedin for the very first time, sharing the stage with heavyweights **PNC & P Money** and rap’s enigmatic _enfant terrible_ **Home Brew.**

  
Orientadium MMXII assembles New Zealand’s funniest Shorter Person (**Dai Henwood**), youngest Billy T Award Winner (**Rhys Mathewson**) and biggest fan fiction fan (**Rose Matafeo**) for a night of Big Laugh Comedy, and the legendary Toga Party kicks off the week’s celebrations with big time tunes from **Bulletproof** & **Jessie G**.
