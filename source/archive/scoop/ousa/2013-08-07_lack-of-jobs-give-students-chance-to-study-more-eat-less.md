Lack of Jobs Give Students Chance to Study More, Eat Less

**Lack of Jobs Give Students Chance to Study More, Eat Less**

Joining the bad news that is the employment situation in Dunedin, the Otago University Students’ Association’s latest Student Job Search data for Otago shows student employment, earnings and the amount of work given to those placed are all down.

“The figures are a disappointing read this month, all employment figures are down.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “It couldn’t come at a worse time for students with allowance cuts already making life difficult for students.”

The figures show that total weeks worked and dollars earned were both down 12%, with students earning almost half a million dollars less this year with $3,318,826 so far compared with $3,785,938 in 2012.

“The 2013 OUSA Student Survey ranked Student Job Search as the second most important service OUSA provides.” Said Francisco Hernandez, “Students are keen to work, what we need in Dunedin are the jobs that provide a chance for students and the public to make the most of the free service.”
