Staff versus Students Round 3

The annual OUSA & University of Otago Community Food Bank Appeal  
September 18th, OUSA Market Day on Campus

After two years it’s one round each as the University of Otago and the Otago University Students’ Association take on their now annual Dunedin Community Food Bank appeal.

“The Dunedin Community Food banks are in constant need of support and this is just one way students and staff can give a little to help those in need.” Said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “It’s also a bit of fun seeing who can donate more out of the students and the staff!”

The OUSA will collect the cans at the OUSA Market Day this September 18th, with a Staff vs Students tally being recorded as the day progresses.

“In 2013 staff just beat the students but in 2012 students won resoundingly.” Said Sycamore-Smith. “Now it’s up to this year to see who CAN take the lead!”

Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne congratulated the students for making this an important annual event.

“The score for students vs staff is all square and this is the all-important decider. I strongly encourage staff to rise to the challenge and give generously.

Of course, round three is a win-win as the more cans that are collected the better it will be for those in need of support from Dunedin’s food banks,” said Professor Hayne.

Any enquiries and early drop offs can be directed to the OUSA Student Support Centre.
