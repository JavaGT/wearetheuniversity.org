Campus Calling Out for Art!

  
Artists are being given the opportunity to showcase their art to New Zealand’s leading young minds as the annual OUSA Art Week opens calls for art installation projects.

“The week has really grown over the past five years with more artists from the University and Otago Polytechnic taking part creating truly interesting installations,” said Rachel Enright, OUSA Senior Events Coordinator. “The idea is to get pop-up art experiences into different spaces on campus and to surprise and delight students in the dead of their wintry study.”

The art can be fixed or interactive projects, and will be placed at nine locations around the university, but the project has the flexibility to allow other areas to open up for use.

“In the past we’ve had interpretive dancers performing on the Leith Bridge and a paint by numbers project alongside fixed work in the Link, so there really is space for almost any idea,” said Miss Enright. “The project is about opening up the campus to new ideas while allowing art to be seen by thousands of people over the course of the week.”

Community groups also have the opportunity with the students’ association offering support to help local groups set up a space on campus.

“There really is the opportunity for anyone to get their ideas out there and if a special group wants to create art on campus then we can supply the help needed to make it happen,”

said Miss Enright. “We have resources to help in a variety of ways so we’re encouraging community groups and even charities to get involved and try something new this OUSA Art Week!”

OUSA invites any artist or group to get in touch to talk about their project, or to find out more visit artweek.ousa.org.nz
