OUSA Elections Achieve “Best Voter Turnout in a Generation”

After two weeks of campaigning and four days of voting, the Otago University Students’ Association 2014 Executive Elections and Referendum have produced a new Executive with a voter turnout that is the best in a generation.

“This elections has seen the highest number of votes cast in a generation, with 25 percent of the student members voting.” Said Francisco Hernandez, the 2013 OUSA President, “Thanks to a group of passionate and competitive candidates and a strong promotional campaign, we’ve managed to secure a great result.”

“This shows that student representation is something not to be cast aside as the recently proposed student council changes announced by Stephen Joyce would have happen.” Said Mr. Hernandez, “It’s now up to the new Executive to maintain OUSA’s popularity and continue to improve the reach of our services and Dunedin events for all Otago tertiary students.”

“The turnout was awesome and I’m looking forward to getting to work and leading my executive next year.” Said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President 2014.

The 2014 Executive will receive training from the current executive before taking control of the 124 year old organisation from 1st January 2014.

The final vote count stands at 5193.
