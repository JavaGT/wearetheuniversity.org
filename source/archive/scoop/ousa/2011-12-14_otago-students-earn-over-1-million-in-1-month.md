**Otago students earn over 1 million in 1 month**

November saw Student Job Search securing paid work for over 720 Otago University students, earning on average $2000 and totalling to over $1.3 million dollars for their back pockets.

“OUSA is focused on providing useful support for students, SJS does just that, and so far Otago students have earned almost six million dollars in 2011.” says Shonelle Eastwood, OUSA Welfare Officer. “It’s exactly what we want to see from our services.”

Even during the summer holidays students are looking for work and they’re using Student Job Search to do so, and with it’s broad scope and connectivity between regions students can search for jobs around the country.

“SJS also gives students the ability to gain experience in the work force and helps out everyday Kiwis both at home and in businesses.” Said Ms. Eastwood. “Being a free service for employers and students means the scope allows for more one off work, so it’s not just businesses that get to benefit from a little extra help.”

OUSA and students associations around the country help fund and govern the Student Job Search service that is continuously evolving, and it’s now easier for employers and students with their services being based online.

“We encourage employers to look to SJS if they’re in need of workers because of its ease, its scope and most importantly we want to work!” Says Ms Eastwood.

Employers can contact Student Job Search at www.sjs.co.nz or 0800 757 562
