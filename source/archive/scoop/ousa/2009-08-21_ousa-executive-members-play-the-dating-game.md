OUSA Executive Members Play the Dating Game

  
Four OUSA members – one from each Division of the University – are heading off to a special lunch tomorrow. They are the winners of the Otago University Students’ Association’s ‘Date a Div Rep’ contest.

The contest, run on Facebook, invited students to answer some simple questions about services provided by OUSA – such as representation and advocacy.

One winner from each Division was chosen.

At midday tomorrow, the four will join Harriet Geoghegan (Commerce Divisional Rep), Fiona Bradley (Health Sciences Divisional Rep), Nathalie Saurat (Sciences Divisional Rep) and Cordelia Huxtable (Humanities Divisional Rep) for a meal at the University’s Staff Club Gallery Restaurant.

The contest was a fun way for the Divisional Representatives to communicate to students what their roles are and to remind them of some of the important things OUSA does for its members.

“102 people took the facebook quiz” said Fiona Bradley, “and most respondents got more than 60% of the questions right.”

The promotion follows the Divisional Rep Roadshow last semester, where each Divisional Rep organised a barbeque and big prize draw in their own areas of campus.
