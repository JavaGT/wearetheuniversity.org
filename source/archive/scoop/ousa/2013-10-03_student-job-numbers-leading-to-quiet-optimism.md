**Student Job Numbers Leading to Quiet Optimism**

The latest Otago figures released by Student Job Search has shown a small glimmer of hope in what has been a rough year for the student job market.

“This has been the best month since March for Otago students looking for work,” said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President. “While the numbers are catching up on last year we’re still behind, hopefully the summer will see more students in seasonal work to reduce the financial pressures they face.”

September saw students earning $435,940 in Otago compared to $299,613 in August, with total earnings so far this year down 4% still at $4,054,379 compared to 2012 which saw $4,234,467 up until the end of September.

“We had predicted we’d be seeing the downward trend stabilising and these numbers confirm that, hopefully this may give us some more reasons for quiet optimism for the future months.” Said Hernandez, “The free service is by far the best way to get in touch with an eager work force who not only needs the money but has the enthusiasm and the desire for the experience that comes with part time and summer work.”
