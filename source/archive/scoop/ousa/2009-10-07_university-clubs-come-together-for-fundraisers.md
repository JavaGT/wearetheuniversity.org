University Clubs Come together for Fundraisers

OUSA's affiliated clubs are coming together to organise a fundraising event to assist Samoa and Tonga Tsunami relief.

Spearheaded by Afrotago, the African students' group on Otago University campus, with assistance from the Sri Lankan and Indian Students Associations, a day of activities is planned for this Saturday 10 October at the North end of Alhambra Rugby Grounds.

\>From 11am to 3pm, there will be a sausage sizzle fundraiser, a raffle, games, sport, fun for the kids (including a bouncy castle).

Entry is free but organiser Miriam Bediako says people are invited to bring with them any donated clothing, tins of food. "Anything they think would be useful."

The combined University clubs are also supporting a fundraising concert organised by the OUSA-affiliated Otago University Samoan Students Association on Thursday October 15. Under the theme "I Love the Islands" there will be a fundraising concert at the Otago University Teachers College Auditorium from 7- 9:30pm. Presales are $7 students, $10 non-students and $2 children.
