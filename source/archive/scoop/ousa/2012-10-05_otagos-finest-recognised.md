**Otago’s Finest Recognised**

Last night the annual Otago Blues and Golds awards were presented to the top athletes and cultural stars from Otago University this evening by the OtagoUniversity Students’ Association.

“The awards recognise the best of the best, the people that give it their all while they’re here at Otago for both sporting and cultural pursuits,” said James Grubb, OUSA Clubs Development Officer, “Both OUSA and the University of Otago are proud to have such talented individuals, teams, clubs and societies making the most of and giving back to Otago.”

This year marks the 105th year of the Blues awards giving top honours to students involved in sports. The awards younger cousin, the Golds Awards, are in their 11th year. The awards recognise clubs, societies and individuals that have given time and effort to cultural endeavours in Otago.

“It really is a special occasion as we’ve given away three Golds this year to three very talented performers,” said Grubb, “And our sportsman and woman of the year are both New Zealand representatives, with Suzie Bates doing so inboth basketball and cricket.”

The Blues and Golds Awards also recognise clubs and societies and the impact they make on the culture of Otago. The hotly contested clubs awards this year went to clubs that have strived for excellence in everything from administration to volunteer and sporting achievements.

“We have over 100 clubs and societies covering both sports and cultural interests. For students clubs are a great way of getting involved and they really add to the social aspect of Otago.” said Grubb, “This year the Otago University Rowing Club took out top honours in the Blues, and the Indian Students’ Society took out the best club or society in the Golds.”

The OUSA and the Otago University congratulate all awards recipients and would like to thank the time and effort each person and club has put into representing and helping the Otago community.
