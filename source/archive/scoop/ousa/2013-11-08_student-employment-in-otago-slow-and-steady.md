Student Employment in Otago ‘Slow and Steady’
=============================================

**Student Employment in Otago ‘Slow and Steady’**

The latest figures released by the student employment service, Student Job Search, show that student employment in the Otago region is stable compared with the figures to date from 2012.

“We’re hoping that after the bleak winter months we’ll see the job situation in Otago continue to stabilise further.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “It’s been a tough year for students looking for work, and after two years of relatively good growth the lack of full and part time jobs for students this year has seen more students in hardship.”

This year has seen an increase of only one percent in the average earnings so far, with the average student earning $1,661 per place. During this time students placed in work, the total dollars earned, and the weeks worked have all decreased from two to three percent, with the total earnings being $4,685,471 compared to $4,775,491 in 2012.

“The effect of the poor performance during the middle of the year has seen more students seeking help as they face financial troubles, and with what looks to be less jobs opportunities over summer this may well have a compounding effect next year.” Said Hernandez, “This idea will be one of the key questions that delegates from for all over the country will be talking about in December at the Student Advocacy Network New Zealand.”

Student Job Search is a free service for students to find and employers looking to advertise work. Jobs can be advertised for free on www.sjs.co.nz.
