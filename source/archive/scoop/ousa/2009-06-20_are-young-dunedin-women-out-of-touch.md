Are Young Dunedin Women “Out of Touch?”

“You are out of touch” Deputy Prime Minister Bill English claimed to protestors outside Dunedin MP Michael Woodhouse’s electoral office this evening.

A vocal and boisterous group of young women from high schools, university and the wider community gathered together to protest Nationals scrapping of the Department of Labour’s Pay and Employment Equity Unit. A great deal of support was shown for the protestors by passing cars, buses, cyclists and pedestrians.

As fate would have it, he was chased down by protestors when trying to leave the venue.

English was good enough to step out of his car to speak to the group. After answering a flurry of questions he started repeating the same phrase “You are out of touch”, before speeding off through the busy intersection in his BMW.

Calling a group of young women concerned about their future out of touch begs the question: just who exactly is Bill English in touch with?
