**Cultural Night Raises over $4000 for Hospice**

A wide range of OUSA affiliated international student associations and lead sponsor ANZ have donated $4272.71 to the Otago Community Hospice. The donation was raised from the annual International Cultural Night held in July that attracted an audience of over 700 guests and public attendees, and included 12 OUSA affiliated Clubs and Societies.

\"It's a great way of showing Dunedin our a range of cultures and raising money for a great cause," said Yee Min Chua, OUSA International Officer, "Our International Clubs are so important to OUSA, they represent over 500 members and they all get right into it to pull off an amazing show every year."

The OUSA today handed over the cheque representing the sum that included the ANZ sponsorship donation as well as the money raised from the event.

"We're so happy to be a part of the event for the fifth year running," said Lyn Chapman, Otago Community Hospice Funding and Marketing Coordinator, "We love the work the cultural groups do and it's a real help for our fundraising effort."

This year the event was run in the Otago University's College of Education Auditorium meaning numbers would more restricted than in previous years when the event had been held in the Town Hall.

"ANZ are delighted to be involved with OUSA in helping the hospice for another year," said Graham Shierlaw, ANZ Branch Manager, "It's important for us to give to this event which helps make a difference in our community."

International Clubs contribute significantly to the overall club structure of OUSA, with international club membership equating to over 20% of total student membership for all clubs. They also make full use of all facilities provided by OUSA Clubs and Societies Centre, through weekly meetings, dance rehearsals, fundraising nights and classes.

"For the students it's a great to show off a little bit of what makes their home special," said Chua, "We have a range of international events, and the clubs are always keen to get involved and it shows in our yearly Golds Awards as they pick up awards every year."

OUSA would like to thank all of the clubs, societies, associations and sponsors for the 2012 International Cultural Night.
