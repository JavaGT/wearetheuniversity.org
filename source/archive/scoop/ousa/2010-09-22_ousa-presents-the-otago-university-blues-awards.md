OUSA presents: the Otago University Blues Awards

The brightest and the best are being celebrated this Friday at the Otago University Blues Awards.

The Awards ceremonies celebrate the best of sporting prowess and cultural involvement of Otago students.

Among the nominees are reigning New Zealand open men’s discus champion Marshall Hall, national swimming championships three times gold medal winner Kate Kenelly, 1500 metre track and field nationals winner and New Zealand record setter Hannah Newbold and 10,000 metre national athletics first place winner Rachel Kingsford.

The keynote speaker at the 102 year old Otago University Blues’ Awards is adventurer and writer Tim Mulliner. His book “Long Ride for a Pie” details his adventures cycling from London to New Zealand through 22 countries in 2001. Harriet Geoghegan, President of Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA), hopes that his story of physical endurance and mad enterprise will be an inspiration for people at the outset of their sports careers.

“We are proud to recognise our students who are not only studying hard towards a degree but also making great achievements in their chosen sports. To succeed in both is worth rewarding” says Otago University Students Association (OUSA) President Harriet Geoghegan.

The Awards night will see University Blues given out to 38 athletes across 12 different sporting disciplines. There are also the Otago University Sportsman and Sportswomen of the Year presentations, and the Otago University Sports Club of the year.

The Awards Ceremony takes place at a function in the University of Otago Council Chamber from 5pm on Friday September 24.  
Media are welcome to attend the ceremony.

Please contact Laura Barrantes to arrange attendance and tell her if you would like interviews with any of the award winners arranged.
