University invites students to discuss fees at fee fi fo forum

by [Michael Oliver](http://www.salient.org.nz/author/michaelo/)

Students and penny pinchers alike are being invited to attend a joint fees forum hosted by VUWSA and Victoria University on Wednesday.

The forum will give students an opportunity to be addressed by the university regarding the setting of domestic fees for 2010 academic year.

Speakers listed to appear at the forum include Emeritus Professor Chancellor Tim Beaglehole, and Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh.

Walsh is expected to address Victoria University’s financial position, and will also take questions “as appropriate.”

VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle said the forum would be an excellent opportunity for students to get in the ears of Victoria’s head honchos.

“The fees forum provides an opportunity for students to constructively engage with the university on the issue of student fees,” Freemantle said.

“Victoria students have not had this opportunity since 2006.”

The University Council will meet in October to determine the shape of course fees, as per the recommendation of the university’s Finance Committee.

The forum will take place at 12pm on Wednesday 9 September in Hunter 220.
