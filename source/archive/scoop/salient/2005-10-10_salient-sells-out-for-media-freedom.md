Salient Sells Out for Media Freedom
===================================

**Press Release: [Salient](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Salient)**

Salient Sells Out for Media Freedom

Salient's fight to overturn the High Court injunction blocking its publication last week has left it with around $8000 in legal fees and lost advertising revenue. The first copy that was liberated from Victoria University is now being auctioned off on TradeMe to help Salient recover its costs.

It is hoped that this auction will help demonstrate the strength with which New Zealanders believe in freedom of the press and transparency in our public bodies.

This gesture will also underscore the lesson for any future organisations that would consider using a similar tactic.

Oh, and it's a great read!

  
Auction can be found here:

Alternatively, we welcome direct donations, too. Please write out cheques to the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association and send it to Salient Defence Fund, C/O VUWSA, PO Box 600, Wellington. Or deposit the money into VUWSA's account, 06 0606 0008285 00.
