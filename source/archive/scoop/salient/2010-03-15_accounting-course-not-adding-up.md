**Accounting Course Not Adding Up**

By Angela Mabey

Victoria University has been forced to address course requirement policy, offer a refund and apologise to students after Victoria student magazine _Salient_ questioned why some students had to pay over and above course costs to complete their course.

Last week, _Salient_ questioned the university over Accounting 111 (ACCY111), a core paper for the Bachelor of Commerce and Administration. This paper required students to purchase a code, either with a new text book or separately, to access online tests on a publisher's website. Without a code, students could not complete the course requirements.

After being approached by _Salient_, Acting Pro Vice-Chancellor Commerce and Administration Professor John Brocklesby investigated the issue and as a result the university is taking steps to rectify it.

\"The university is pleased that _Salient_ has brought this matter to our attention."

Brocklesby says that including the tests as a course requirement was not appropriate.

"Students should not be required to pay extra for compulsory components of their courses and we would like to apologise to students for this oversight.”

Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Commerce and Administration Professor Bob Buckle says the online revision questions and online tests are still set for students enrolled in ACCY 111 in trimester one 2010.

"However, completion of the online work is not required to meet assessment or other course requirements this trimester."

The university has decided to offer a refund to compensate for the inappropriate use of the online tests as part of paper requirements.

The university has emailed students from last year’s ACCY 111 and ACCY 223 (trimester three offering) courses to apologise and to invite those students who feel they were disadvantaged to apply for compensation.

"All heads of schools throughout the university have been called personally to discuss the policy on fee setting to ensure students are not overcharged for any other courses at the university.”

When questioned how the situation arose in the first place, Buckle says it was a direct result of the review of paper points values.

"The issue with ACCY111 happened as a result of reorganising and streamlining the delivery of the course under the new 15-point paper regime.”

A student who took ACCY111 over summer says that it is disappointing the situation has arisen, but is pleased Victoria is taking the matter seriously.

"The lecturers and tutors didn't have to administer or mark our tests, if they wanted us to do tests online, it should have been included in our fees.

"It's a bit disappointing that Vic wasn't aware of the problem before _Salient_ brought it up, but it is good to see that they are making changes now they are aware."

VUWSA president Max Hardy says VUWSA has not received any complaints from students.

"We are pleased that Victoria is working to address the problem.”
