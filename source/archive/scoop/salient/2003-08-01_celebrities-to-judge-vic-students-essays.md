Celebrities to judge students’ essays

A panel of celebrities will be at Victoria University next Thursday night (7 August) to judge a student essay writing competition about whether commerce belongs in universities.

MPs Jonathan Hunt, Winston Peters, and Deborah Coddington will be joined by property tycoon Sir Robert Jones, cartoonist and playwright Tom Scott, politics Professor Margaret Clark, and Commander of the Joint Forces Major-General Martyn Dunne.

The essay writing competition - organised by Salient (Victoria's student magazine) and Jones – offers students a chance to win a first prize of $1000 or five second prizes of $100 by writing 250 words on the topic 'that the study of commerce has nothing to do with scholarship'.

At a function next Thursday night, the judges will read out shortlisted entries to a crowd made up of entrants and invited guests, eliciting crowd comment, before deciding upon the winners. The judging function runs from 6pm to 8pm, and media are welcome to attend. Refreshments will be provided.

WHAT: Salient-Jones Commerce Bash

WHEN: Thursday, August 7, 6pm

WHERE: Union Hall, Second Floor, Student Union Building, Kelburn Campus, Victoria University
