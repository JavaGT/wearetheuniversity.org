WEBVTT

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.120
Speaker 1: The chat is not available to the public.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.340
Speaker 1: We've

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.440
Speaker 1: been told, right? We've done what we can to get with it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.520
Speaker 1: We're

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.600
Speaker 1: live.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.520
Speaker 1: We

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.280
Speaker 1: are live? Right.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.740
Speaker 1: Nau

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:28.240
Speaker 1: mai, haere mai, piki mai, ki tēne hui. Welcome everybody, I welcome the public to part A of the Council meeting and I apologise for the delay in the start of the meeting.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:45.980
Speaker 1: We started with a kārakiia at the beginning of the briefing, so we won't do that. Do we have any apologies? I believe we have a complete - everybody from the council is here, so we have no apologies.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.180
Speaker 1: I'd

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:59.980
Speaker 1: like to - Can we just check - are we just checking that the meeting is up? I can just see meeting 27 button, which is the name of the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.840
Speaker 1: I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.059
Speaker 1: can't see anything else. My sound is off so I can't.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.520
Sorry.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.880
Speaker 2: We might have to put that camera on.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.820
Speaker 1: Sorry we're just making sure that we do in fact have the public meeting open.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.120
Speaker 1: I'm

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.600
Speaker 1: just refreshing the page, I'll try again.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.240
Speaker 1: Yes,

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:44.340
Speaker 1: it's fine. Okay, alright, we are in a public meeting, good, thank you very much. Okay, alright, so could I ask,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700
Speaker 1: just

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:59.980
Speaker 1: draw everybody's attention to the conflicts of interest policy and ask if anybody has any conflicts to declare in respect of matters that are being dealt with

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.120
Speaker 1: today?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.660
Speaker 2: Did you want me to raise those in Part B?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.720
Speaker 1: Any conflicts you have for the entire meeting should be raised now?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:29.980
Speaker 2: It's in relation to the leases with Melanesian Mission Trust Board and my conflict as a funding officer for the Pacific Island Law Students Association. I've been in talks with the Melanesian Mission Trust Board

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.660
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Gemma?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.540
Speaker 3: And just noting that my brother works for Hayden and Rollett.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.760
Great.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.020
Speaker 1: Thank you.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.840
Speaker 1: All

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.640
Speaker 1: right. Okay. So I'll move that those disclosures be noted. I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.520
Speaker 1: don't,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.980
Speaker 1: looking at those, I don't see any need for

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.920
Speaker 1: us to disqualify either of those people from the conversation.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.920
Speaker 1: To get

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:21.440
Speaker 1: to the item, we can discuss that more specifically. So in the meantime, I will move those disclosures be noted and the action taken be endorsed. Julia told me, could I ask you to second that, please?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.820
Speaker 1: Thank

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.760
Speaker 1: you very much.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.240
Speaker 1: Okay,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.980
Speaker 1: so now we have and you will see in the agenda

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.920
Speaker 1: a fabulously long list of the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.160
Speaker 1: people

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:51.540
Speaker 1: who are either at the university, with the university, associated with the university, alumni of the university, who were recognised in the New Year's honours list and just a fabulous list of people there. And the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.920
Speaker 1: Vice

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.980
Speaker 1: -Chancellor and I have written to each of these people to congratulate them and received

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:28.680
Speaker 1: A, so moving to the council meetings, we have the draft minutes of part A,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.560
Speaker 1: of those minutes

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.920
Speaker 1: and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.640
Speaker 1: I'll just ask if anybody has any comments on the minutes of part A of the council meeting.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.960
Speaker 1: Yes

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.380
Speaker 1: Julia.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.300
Yes

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:56.860
Speaker 4: I've got two comments the first is that Gemma and I didn't declare a conflict of interest so it shows that all council members declared a conflict of interest.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.280
Speaker 4: Gemma

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.980
Speaker 4: and I and I believe Dawn

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.240
Speaker 4: but I don't know for sure don't receive fees for being around the council table so that's the first point

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.320
Speaker 4: oh

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320
Speaker 4: yes yeah good point

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.840
Speaker 4: um

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.740
Speaker 4: and the second issue and I'm sorry to raise this again I have raised it a number of times

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.060
Speaker 4: um

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.920
Speaker 4: and it I'm really sorry Cecilia it does put you in a bit of an awkward position but um

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.320
Speaker 4: and

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.980
Speaker 4: it concerns the October meeting uh when we reappointed the alumnus

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:41.540
Speaker 4: So it's recorded that I raised concerns about us not following section 11 of the council appointments procedure so that's section 11 not section 18

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.820
Speaker 4: but

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.300
Speaker 4: it wasn't that I raised concerns about us not following it

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.920
Speaker 4: I

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.440
Speaker 4: said that we didn't follow it

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.660
Speaker 4: and

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.020
Speaker 4: that was a meeting I'm sorry I must be in the wrong minutes can you point me to where you are in

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.980
Speaker 1: the minutes this

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.720
Speaker 1: This is part of... Diligent page nine. Diligent page nine. Okay. Oh,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:28.300
Speaker 4: yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. So yes, yes. Right. We were reappointing the alumnus member. Right. And the procedure to follow is section 11 of the council appointments procedure. And that was on Zoom meeting. So it's actually recorded and you can watch it online. And it's quite clear when you watch it. I'm a person with the right idea but the wrong procedure.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.620
Speaker 4: So section 11 of the council appointments procedure says that

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.520
Speaker 4: the

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:46.520
Speaker 4: vice chancellors review and executive remuneration committee when a member comes up for appointment is to advise council on the merits of running an expression of interest or not

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.500
Speaker 4: and

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.380
Speaker 4: then council is to decide whether or not

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.660
Speaker 4: it

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.320
Speaker 4: runs that expression of interest but when you look at those

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.780
Speaker 4: at

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.580
Speaker 4: the recording we don't receive any advice and we don't

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:17.600
Speaker 4: don't make the decision not to run an EOI. So what I was raising in December is that the minutes of October showed that we followed Section 11 when we in fact didn't. And I think that does leave the university in a little bit of an

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.880
Speaker 4: awkward

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:29.580
Speaker 4: situation because we are risk adverse when it comes to the governance strategy and I think it means, you know, if we haven't followed an appointments procedure that we are open to

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:40.260
Speaker 4: challenges or to the perception that we're not acting with integrity. So my suggestion would be that we redo that appointments process. And, you know, if we were going to be

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.540
Speaker 4: really

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:48.180
Speaker 4: robust, maybe use the more robust EOI process. But that's not my decision to make. That's Council's decision.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:05.400
Speaker 1: Okay, well, my suggestion with that would be that, as you say, because it's a matter for the VCRC, that that should go back to the VCRC

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.420
Speaker 1: to

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.360
Speaker 1: decide.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.720
Speaker 1: Well,

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:24.300
Speaker 1: yeah, my suggestion would be that it go back to the VCRC and the VCRC can decide what to do about the process. Because there is also, yeah, and as you say, it's not really for me to say. I might turn over to

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.500
Speaker 1: I don't know whether there is

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.340
a...

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:54.280
Speaker 5: I'm thinking of off my head, Cecilia. So sorry, Julia, not to necessarily disagree with you, but I don't have the statute in front of me. I appreciate you've read it, but I guess you're expressing your opinion that in your view it's clear that we did not. But look, as I say, Julia, I have no reason to disagree or not agree. I just don't have the language in front of me.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:18.080
Speaker 5: Why don't we just take note that you had... Yes, I'm happy if you just note that... You did not, but you expressed the view that the process... In her opinion, the process was not followed under Section 11 rather than Section 18. And then let's take an action point to go away and review that. And if we need to tidy things up procedurally, we should do that.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.080
And

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.620
Speaker 4: we should also correct the minutes for the October meeting, which still show we followed the process.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.160
Speaker 5: Adrienne, do you have any comments? So

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:41.340
Speaker 6: the difficulty for Wendy and me is that we're not at the VCRC meeting, so we can't really provide any assurance that

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.440
Speaker 6: procedures

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.720
Speaker 6: were followed or not. So it will be a matter for VCRC to consider. It's not about what happened

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.000
Speaker 4: in the

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.500
Speaker 4: VCRC,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.660
Speaker 4: I always get that wrong,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.140
Speaker 4: because we are told and I have no reason to disbelieve them that they did decide to make

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.040
Speaker 4: provide

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.520
Speaker 4: advice to council but the fact is that council didn't receive that advice will make a decision that's my point.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.200
So

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:24.280
Speaker 1: let's just you know I think we understand we understand your point Julia I think that as you say it's not really for me to say but I think Kathy's suggestion is a good one that we that you have expressed your view that the process was not followed and that we will refer

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.860
Speaker 1: it back to the VCRC to decide what to do and

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.140
Speaker 1: they

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.800
Speaker 1: can come to the next council meeting

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.700
Speaker 1: and

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.820
Speaker 1: advise as to what they would propose to do. Okay?

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.820
Speaker 1: And

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.020
Speaker 1: yeah, I

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.900
Speaker 1: think

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.220
Speaker 1: I

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:42.840
Speaker 1: realise

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.160
Speaker 1: I have...

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.040
Speaker 1: they

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.960
Speaker 1: gave them to me, sorry. Okay. All right, okay. Now that

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.280
Speaker 1: was...

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.820
Speaker 1: Did you say you had two things Julia or was that both things? Oh no, no, you covered the first

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.100
Speaker 2: one.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:15.320
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. No, the disclosure of interest got that one and then the second one. Yep, no, appreciate that. Thank you. Are there any further comments on the minutes?

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.880
Speaker 1: All

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.280
Speaker 1: right, then I will move that the minutes

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.340
Speaker 1: as amended

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.340
Speaker 1: as

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.080
Speaker 1: discussed

Speaker 1: taken as read and confirmed and I will ask Kathy to Kathy Quinn to second those minutes. Thank you very much. And I'll just ask if there is anybody when I call for a seconder I'll then also call for a vote. Is there anybody I ask everybody to vote please or if the

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.100
Speaker 1: probably

Speaker 1: it's easier

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.100

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.780
Speaker 1: yeah

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:24.280
Speaker 1: and then this is the matters arising obviously deals with what uh julia has raised and uh we will that that will go back to the

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.860
Speaker 1: PCRC.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.920
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:32.260
Speaker 1: Now we are on to the Vice Chancellor's report. I will invite the Vice Chancellor

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.560
Speaker 1: to

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.160
Speaker 1: speak to her report.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.280
Sure,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:45.940
Speaker 7: thank you, Chancellor. And as always, I'll take the report as read. As you know, despite

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.060
Speaker 7: capturing

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:54.060
Speaker 7: a huge amount of activity and engagements for the first quarter of the year, the report is slightly out of date.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:10.800
Speaker 7: So I'll supplement it with some of the recent meetings I've had with Minister Retty, some of the discussions through the University's New Zealand Vice Chancellors Group and a range of other engagements across ENZ and with the University Advisory Group.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:11.860
Speaker 7: So

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:22.940
Speaker 7: I'll start with just an acknowledgement that given the Cabinet reshuffle, which is still shaking down actually, we've had a conversation with Minister Stamford now

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.680
Speaker 7: in

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.240
Speaker 7: her role

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:38.480
Speaker 7: as well as immigration, which we hope is actually going to lead to beneficial outcomes for us. She's very aware of the interrelationship between the two. And although we've seen an improvement

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.560
Speaker 7: in

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:53.100
Speaker 7: the turnaround time and the support we're getting from Immigration New Zealand, particularly before semester one starts, we still have some further work to do in terms of those applications and visas being processed.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:14:16.100
Speaker 7: So that's all work underway. And I had the good fortune to meet with the new ENZ CEO Amanda Marlou, who is also working behind the scenes to develop an approach that Immigration New Zealand can support us with across the whole pipeline. That's students coming into the schools as well as that pipeline coming into the university.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:17.900
Speaker 7: That

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:23.380
Speaker 7: work continues. We've had a meeting with Minister Retty and I was

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:51.520
Speaker 7: I'm pleased to have him on campus very early in his appointment in making the announcement about the applied doctoral scheme which is an extra 20 million dollars over a period of time to support those applied doctorates it's a joint program of work of course with other universities but it really is actually quite a significant step towards that application and translation and impact agenda that you're hearing so much about.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.440
Speaker 7: Minister Retty has been talking to us about his priorities.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:01.320
Speaker 7: And I thought it would be useful just to reiterate those in terms of where he's heading.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.680
Speaker 7: So his four priorities

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.660
Speaker 7: are

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.860
Speaker 7: participation in higher education across the board.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:17.840
Speaker 7: And that's one of the areas of interest also that the Office of the Auditor General has alerted us to being interested in

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.560
Speaker 7: that

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.800
Speaker 7: and retention.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.080
Speaker 7: And so the second of Minister Reti's priorities is retention and completion

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.300
Speaker 7: of

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:33.060
Speaker 7: students once they're into higher education. And the OAG has signalled it will be doing

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.020
Speaker 7: further

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.880
Speaker 7: work auditing retention

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:36.740
Speaker 7: and

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:50.020
Speaker 7: retention across specific cohorts. I needed to mention Māori Pacific and other equity groups, but overall very interested to understand what all the sector is doing in terms of retention and attrition of students.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.280
Speaker 7: The

00:15:51.280 --> 00:16:15.020
Speaker 7: third area of priorities commercialization. Now you've seen this coming from the Prime Minister in the context of the research organizations, the changes to the CRIs and the changes to Callaghan. And we are working, of course, with Frank and Uni Services and across the board looking at ways in which we can be

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.580
Speaker 7: influential

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.220
Speaker 7: and instrumental in supporting the public research.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.380
Speaker 7: organizations when they start to merge

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.380
Speaker 7: out

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:30.760
Speaker 7: of that SSAG. Notwithstanding that, doing a huge amount of footwork,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.740
Speaker 7: treading

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:41.200
Speaker 7: the boards around being a comprehensive university and ensuring that arts, humanities, social sciences continues to be supported.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.040
Speaker 7: The

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:49.620
Speaker 7: fourth priority that the Minister has is related to our engagement with industry and business.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:50.600
Speaker 7: and

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.260
Speaker 7: particularly thinking about

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.860
Speaker 7: that

00:16:52.860 --> 00:17:02.840
Speaker 7: innovation and impact pipeline. As you know, Frank's been doing a huge amount of work in positioning us really well from a research point of view

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.620
Speaker 7: and

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:10.199
Speaker 7: configuring the support, the Research and Innovation Office to meet that agenda.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:11.800
Speaker 7: The

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:20.360
Speaker 7: work on the UAG continues to be a little bit opaque at the moment. What we are aware of is

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:35.780
Speaker 7: that by the 30th of April, we should see a report coming out from the government in relation to fiscal recommendations. And this is about the principles being defined

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.040
Speaker 7: and

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:47.640
Speaker 7: the modelling for future funding models for universities. And there are a range of things that the UAG are looking at, including a ministerial advisory council

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.700
Speaker 7: and

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.360
Speaker 7: supporting some of the work that

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.780
Speaker 7: that they're currently doing through the TEC and looking at ways in which

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.600
Speaker 7: funding

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.680
Speaker 7: might be differentiated in the future.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.560
Speaker 7: To

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:20.320
Speaker 7: that point, and closer to home, having met with the TEC last week, and Pamela now has received the planning guidance, it's very clear that the emphasis towards STEM disciplines and to thinking about that differentiated discipline mix across the university is starting to come.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:31.160
Speaker 7: come to fruition. And while we don't have the full information to hand about what that will mean for other disciplines, then I think we do know that there is a push

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.180
Speaker 7: for

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.560
Speaker 7: growth by the government

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.660
Speaker 7: and

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:45.260
Speaker 7: economic growth through science, technology and innovation, of course, engineering. And we are including in that the work that we're doing in medtech

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.140
Speaker 7: and

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.400
Speaker 7: through the ABI and the links to

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.120
Speaker 7: the

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.360
Speaker 7: medical faculty

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.540
Speaker 7: where we've just been informed that we're going to be receiving an additional

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.020
Speaker 7: 25

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.080
Speaker 7: places to be distributed between

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.160
Speaker 7: ourselves

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.280
Speaker 7: and Otago.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:02.920
Speaker 7: So

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.520
Speaker 7: this is all of course huge amount happening every day

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.500
Speaker 7: as

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:20.360
Speaker 7: you know and we're trying to make sure that we're keeping on top of this in terms of responding but also getting ahead and that's been an important piece of work and so on Wednesday the senior leadership team

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:32.160
Speaker 7: We met last week to look at our planning date for the next 12 months. And we had some excellent discussions around both the way in which the professional staff

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.360
Speaker 7: structure

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:41.940
Speaker 7: is starting to shape up. You'll recall that we're doing some work around that linked to that $45 million that we are working to

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.960
Speaker 7: save

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.520
Speaker 7: by the end of the year. And that's now starting to take some shape.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:56.840
Speaker 7: in wanting to restructure the executive to have the deans as members of the exec and that's now

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.540
Speaker 7: coming

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:04.120
Speaker 7: into being quite soon. We've had the first meeting we're working on the terms of reference which will be circulating

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.980
Speaker 7: as

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.780
Speaker 7: part of the committee responsibilities

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.880
Speaker 7: across

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.840
Speaker 7: to the university

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.380
Speaker 7: and

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:17.740
Speaker 7: within all of that the opportunity to really think about the university's communication and marketing strategy

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.980
Speaker 7: featured

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.320
Speaker 7: on the day as well.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:44.300
Speaker 7: the work that Adrian and Andrew and the team are leading across professional staff and the culture and transformation work at the leadership level. All of that is very high level. And of course, the external and the internal environment is very feverish. Not surprisingly, council's aware of some of the challenges we've faced

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.140
Speaker 7: with

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:50.340
Speaker 7: the external conflicts across a range of areas, including some of the challenges to funding coming through

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.180
Speaker 7: through the US

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.440
Speaker 7: changes

00:20:52.440 --> 00:21:07.860
Speaker 7: to their regulation and funding of US support for scholarships and research. And of course, internally, we've been working through initiatives, including looking at the

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.640
Speaker 7: law

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.960
Speaker 7: and business and economic school proposal, which of course we'll be talking about later, but a range of

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.700
Speaker 7: other

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.840
Speaker 7: initiatives as well.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.820
Speaker 7: I

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.340
Speaker 7: should say we've had a fantastic start to the

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.000
Speaker 7: in terms of onboarding of students, O-Week,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.020
Speaker 7: and

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.960
Speaker 7: just generally the atmosphere on campus and having the students around has been

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.820
Speaker 7: really

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.380
Speaker 7: lively

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.340
Speaker 7: and

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.760
Speaker 7: dynamic. And some of that obviously is centred around our new

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.100
Speaker 7: HIWA

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.020
Speaker 7: Recreation Centre, which is

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.900
Speaker 7: not

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:48.280
Speaker 7: only thriving, but really creating an opportunity for students to have fantastic meeting spaces.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:58.020
Speaker 7: and it's great to see that that's the case. I think I'll stop there. There's so much in the report that we could go to, but that's probably a high enough level for now, Chancellor.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.600
Thank

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:06.820
Speaker 1: you. Could I see, are there any questions for the Vice-Chancellor on her report?

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.800
Jonathan? Yes,

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:18.160
Speaker 8: I'm on page three, Don, and it's a little table. And there's a line there that says,

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:37.580
Speaker 8: Domestic funded. And I just wanted to be clear that I'm not to compare 23,000 to 30,000. It's just sort of the time of year. And so you can sort of ignore it looks like there's sort of a big

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.780
Speaker 8: drop.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:47.760
Speaker 8: But I'm assuming because it's February, the data just isn't relevant. So it's apples and oranges. Do you see what I'm saying?

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.360
Speaker 7: And Tim's nodding.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.660
Speaker 7: We're

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.840
Speaker 7: both in agreement. I mean,

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.760
Speaker 7: if

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.380
Speaker 7: you wanted to

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.720
Speaker 8: have... Yeah.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.820
Speaker 7: Just wanted to

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.560
Speaker 8: confirm that. Yeah. Good. Thank you.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.800
Speaker 4: Julia?

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:06.900
Speaker 4: Yeah,

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:18.040
Speaker 4: I have a couple of questions. Just clarification and maybe a little bit of a comment. So I'll just ask my questions first and comment and then I'll leave it to you to respond.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.380
Speaker 4: So I'm looking at page 25 on diligent

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.880
Speaker 4: and

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:31.240
Speaker 4: I'm just asking for a bit of clarification what we mean about cultural conducting culture diagnostics and developing an organizational culture plan

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.140
Speaker 4: and

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.020
Speaker 4: culture transformation

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.640
Speaker 4: and

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.660
Speaker 4: we also refer to an engagement and listening strategy which I'm assuming refers to the

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.680
Speaker 4: employee

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.760
Speaker 4: surveys that we've been bringing out approximately every five years

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.200
Speaker 4: and

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.340
Speaker 4: just a comment around that

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.020
Speaker 4: I realize that staff

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.100
Speaker 4: provide

00:23:52.100 --> 00:24:03.440
Speaker 4: a cacophony of voices, particularly around controversial issues. But I do think it's really significant when faculty, I'm not just talking about law here,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.160
Speaker 4: across

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:18.340
Speaker 4: the university, do make well-reasoned, well-argued submissions into university policy processes that those are given quite a lot of weight. Because of course if we don't feel heard in the

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.760
Speaker 4: those things, enrolling out of staff survey feels a little bit performative.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:32.720
Speaker 7: Sure, Julia, thanks for the questions. I'm going to start with your second one first. And I'll invite, and I don't think Andrew is on the Zoom.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.120
Speaker 7: No.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:44.820
Speaker 7: No, but I can comment on the second one first. So on the sentiment surveys and the survey, so in the five years that I've been here, we've done three in five years.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:25:10.880
Speaker 7: So, yes, I think I just want to correct the fact that it's every five years. So what was happening before I arrived is we were doing them every two years and we were engaging an external consultant. And in terms of the external consultant, we had less, we were selecting questions that were available to us and we were able to make some modifications to those.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:11.980
Speaker 7: But

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:19.800
Speaker 7: when I arrived, it was important, I think, because we were during, I mean, things have changed. We're in such an accelerated pace that

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.580
Speaker 7: every

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:39.960
Speaker 7: two years, things are, it's a long time, actually, in the current context, isn't it? So I suggested that when we did the first one, which was in my second year, because it had been done the year before I arrived, that we thought about doing much more concentrated surveys on a more regular basis.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:50.860
Speaker 7: And so we've done two more since then so we've done three and five years. And there's another one planned for later this year so that will actually be four in six years.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.000
Speaker 7: But

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.300
Speaker 7: it's not about the number I think it's about the quality of the survey as well and what we do with it. So many people will know

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.180
Speaker 7: that

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:10.500
Speaker 7: when we we've modified and been able to adapt some of the questions to target specific issues that are contemporary in the university at that time.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:35.100
Speaker 7: So that's the data is actually looked at not just at the senior leadership team level and the exec level, it's given to the faculty deans and to the directors of the different parts of the university's professional staff.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.060
Speaker 7: And that level of detail goes all the way down

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.160
Speaker 7: so

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:49.500
Speaker 7: that they can start to look at some of the things that they're responding to within their specific areas as well as what the themes are across the university. So we've got the high level themes

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.380
Speaker 7: and

00:26:50.380 --> 00:27:05.320
Speaker 7: we've got what's happening in different units and different areas. Now one of the things we spoke about in the meeting on Wednesday last week was Andrew talking through the process and plans for this year's

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:08.660
Speaker 7: So

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:34.020
Speaker 7: I think that's really important to get that sort of structure of it not it not being every two years but more frequently and also really much more targeted as well. So that's that's I think the first comment I would like to make now Andrew's not here but Andrew has been leading with us sorry I'm just looking at the I wanted to refer directly to your point here the cultural diagnostics.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:34.860
Speaker 7: So

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:42.320
Speaker 7: Andrew's been leading a piece of work with his team on looking at developing that.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.320
Speaker 7: So

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:58.840
Speaker 7: there's a there is a diagnostic piece of work that is done. It's something that comes through both the employer survey and a whole piece of work that then crystallizes into some diagnostics and then developing the organizational culture plan in the context

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.800
Speaker 7: of

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.200
Speaker 7: the future workforce, because of course that's also changing as well Julia.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.940
Speaker 7: and

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.340
Speaker 7: thinking about, you know, if you're going to have, let me use this example,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.240
Speaker 7: if

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:18.400
Speaker 7: you're going to have a workforce that is spending more time working from home, now I'll use that example, I'm pulling it off the top of my head,

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.480
Speaker 7: or

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.940
Speaker 7: engaging more with AI or any of those things, then what sort of culture do you create to build

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:26.800
Speaker 7: the

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.360
Speaker 7: community and to bond around those various

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.420
Speaker 7: themes

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.340
Speaker 7: in our strategy?

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:59.880
Speaker 7: and values. And that's the work that is currently just starting to be talked about through the senior leadership team. So I think, as I say, it's early days in that and another survey will help very much with that. And I hope that gives you a bit more flesh on those points. But I'm also happy if you're interested to put this onto the all staff soon, have Andrew talk about it a bit more.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.160
So

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.520
Speaker 1: we're not coming through Gemma.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.040
Speaker 3: Yeah. Can you hear me now?

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:11.540
Yep.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.760
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:20.960
Speaker 3: Just saying thank you for that update Dawn and for that extra explanation. I had a similar question earlier, but I think it could be an interesting topic for an all-stop

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.500
Speaker 3: Zoom.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:30.400
Speaker 3: Mine was more of an acknowledgement rather than a question, but really outstanding results with the graduate destination survey. Very affirming

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.260
Speaker 3: for

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:31.900
Speaker 3: us as a community.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.540
Speaker 3: to know that all the efforts that staff

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.140
Speaker 3: are

00:29:35.140 --> 00:30:01.900
Speaker 3: making are incurring outcomes for our students. And then also in terms of our EFs, I appreciate this report was written slightly before the start of semester, but to share with our fellow council members that things have landed really favourably and that teams have been working incredibly well together across the university. And I'm just, I'm really proud of our professional staff and the way that they've come together to make this happen. There's been a number of really good gains and they're now in the hands of the teaching and learning environment.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:06.320
Speaker 3: and all our pastoral care staff. So just really excited about the year here. It's been a very exciting start.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.220
Great

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:31.920
Speaker 7: acknowledgement because a lot of this work goes on, of course, before the semester, a huge amount. And the professional staff really working hard on that. And, you know, people don't just turn up on the first day accidentally. Huge amounts happen there. But also thank you for your acknowledgement about the Graduate Destination Survey. I think what I would like to say in response

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.120
Speaker 7: that

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.900
Speaker 7: is

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:42.160
Speaker 7: there are some amazing things happening in this institution and across the board and it's really important that we do acknowledge those achievements as well thank you

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.200
great

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:52.920
Speaker 1: all right well i think the no more questions then i will um move that the vice chancellor's report be noted and i'm going to ask john to second that yes

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.800

Speaker 1: Okay, then I'm going to move that those minutes be received.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.300
Speaker 1: Good,

Speaker 1: right, you're four, thank you. Okay, then I'm going to go to the Audit and Commit, Audit and Risk Committee, the Part A minutes. And I'm going to, there's really any questions on those?

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:10.100
Speaker 1: I'm going to move that those be received and I'm going to ask Jonathan to second that. Thank you very much Jonathan. All those in favour?

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:12.720
Speaker 1: Thank

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:19.040
Speaker 1: you. Then I'm going to go to the Capital Expenditure Committee. This is only part, this is part A

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.860
Speaker 1: and

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.260
Speaker 1: I'm going to move if there are any questions on part A. I'm going to move that those be received

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.260
Speaker 1: and

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.800
Speaker 1: I'll ask Gemma to second those. Thank you very much Gemma.

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:50.260
Speaker 1: All those in favour? Thank you very much. And then I'll move to the Student Appeals Committee report there. It's the report to Council. And we have with us the current chair and also members of that committee if people have any questions

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.980
Speaker 1: around

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.800
Speaker 1: that report.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:53.960
Speaker 1: Are

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.640
Speaker 1: there any questions around that report?

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:57.760
Speaker 1: No?

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.920
Speaker 1: All good. Thank you very much. So I'm going to move that that be received and I'm going to

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.720
Speaker 1: I ask John to second that. Thank you very much John.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:06.660
Speaker 1: I'm

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.200
Speaker 1: then going to move to the report of Senate

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.380
Speaker 1: and

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.700
Speaker 1: I'm going to turn to Dawn if she'd like to

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.260
Speaker 1: speak

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:24.540
Speaker 1: to the report to Senate and we also have with us Simon Hodaway who is the Acting DVC Education.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.680
Speaker 1: So

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.440
Speaker 1: Dawn, you first.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:57.740
Speaker 7: So we had that first meeting of Senate, as you can see from the papers in March, and the three meaty items on the agenda that I'll speak to and there's obviously the other reports that you see in there, but I'll just talk to these three items and then if you've got questions on the other items that's also fine. And I'm going to ask Simon to chip in as well.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:17.580
Speaker 7: So I'll start with what is probably relatively straightforward to deal with, which is that for some time now I'm going actually to start with the item that's in the Senate summary there under C. So this is under C, freedom of expression.

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.700
Speaker 7: And

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:32.840
Speaker 7: I'm going to start with that because that's probably the straightforward one. What we've been doing as a Senate, as you know, councils have multiple reports on this. We've been working towards the development of a freedom of expression

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.919
Speaker 7: policy

00:34:33.919 --> 00:34:47.919
Speaker 7: and we've been doing that work over a long period of time, five years now, actually before my time, so longer than that. And Sir Peter Hunter led the group. We've also done some further work linking it to

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:58.780
Speaker 7: academic freedom. And to cut a long story short and not repeat myself, of course, we ended in Senate last year with a policy that we were debating and discussing.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.120
Speaker 7: And

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:07.060
Speaker 7: at the same time, the government has determined that it will be working through legislation that will be going through

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.160
Speaker 7: Parliament

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:17.920
Speaker 7: soon. And so for all universities. And so we've decided that, as you can see from the note, that until the

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:18.660
Speaker 7: And then to the legislation was available,

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:19.760
Speaker 7: there

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.720
Speaker 7: was very little point in us doing further work on the creation of our policy

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.920
Speaker 7: in

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:31.760
Speaker 7: order to make sure that we're aligned with the work that the government is putting together and that legislation when it becomes available.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:39.780
Speaker 7: I'm sort of understanding that's imminent but we were told it might be imminent in December and we're in March so

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:40.780
Speaker 7: I'm

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:44.540
Speaker 7: not sure what that means but that's work ongoing.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:36:00.160
Speaker 7: Then to the matter of under a consideration of future future faculty arrangements and the recommendations. We have a large Senate minute of this which Council will be referred to

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.180
Speaker 7: as

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:11.480
Speaker 7: you're aware I've suggested that we have an extraordinary meeting of Council. Public facing in that we can discuss not only the.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:29.520
Speaker 7: and the discussion that took place at Senate and the subsequent vote, but also the review committee's report. This was the review committee that reviewed the 793 submissions

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.020
Speaker 7: and

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.900
Speaker 7: made some recommendations and engaged with that group

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.060
Speaker 7: of

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:42.720
Speaker 7: students and some independent experts and a range of other people to come together to look at those submissions.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:43.500
Speaker 7: and

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:54.520
Speaker 7: that we actually have a separate discussion about this. And I know that, Chancellor, you've agreed to that and that we'll be looking to a separate date

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.320
Speaker 7: to

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.060
Speaker 7: have that

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.480
Speaker 7: in

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:10.400
Speaker 7: part as a public discussion, given that we were not able to meet the timeline under our standing orders, under the orders to be able to do this in this meeting.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:34.160
Speaker 7: So I'm going to just suggest that we put that to the next meeting, which I'm hoping will be quite soon. And then I want to come to B, which was the CFT. Now, Council are very aware that last year we had a meeting of Senate and Council, which we agreed that we would go back to Senate

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.260
Speaker 7: in

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:41.360
Speaker 7: March and that during that period of time, we would undertake

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:47.220
Speaker 7: two or three pieces of work that we will report back to Senate on and then through to Council.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.620
Speaker 7: So

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:55.640
Speaker 7: since that time I asked Simon Holdaway who is in the Acting DVC E-Roll to convene a group

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.040
Speaker 7: to

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:05.640
Speaker 7: look at essentially two or three things which he could speak to. One of which of course was related to our transdisciplinary

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.320
Speaker 7: courses,

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.780
Speaker 7: the other was related to Wipe Up a Tow Mater

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.360
Speaker 7: Row

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:41.360
Speaker 7: And the third thing I asked him to look at actually was to look at what we were doing in Flexi Choice. And so Simon has led that piece of work and he reported that back to Senate. And I'd like to have him speak to that report and provide an update to council. And this is really a progress report because what we've agreed is we would like more time. I've suggested that Simon really work with the faculties on these issues between

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:48.080
Speaker 7: the Senate meeting that took place on the 3rd of March and the next one which is taking place in April

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.160
Speaker 7: and

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:56.260
Speaker 7: so there's further work underway and there will be the whole of this year Chancellor as you're aware because that was a commitment that we made

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.440
Speaker 7: and

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:06.120
Speaker 7: I'd like him to talk to where we've got to but noting this is a progress report rather than you know really asking or seeking

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.180
Speaker 7: counsel

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.960
Speaker 7: to endorse or to review anything in particular

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.860
Speaker 7: because

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.360
Speaker 7: we're coming

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:26.980
Speaker 7: coming back again, of course, we've got a council meeting in April after the April Senate meeting. So can I hand over to Simon at this point? Yeah,

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:38.260
Speaker 1: Simon, absolutely. Simon, would you like to speak to the process that you've gone through in the review and the report then

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.180
Speaker 1: to

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:39.440
Speaker 1: Senate?

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.800
to

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:49.940
Speaker 9: talk about this. The report that colleagues on Council will see in front of them is indeed a draft report that

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:50.880
Speaker 9: a

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.120
Speaker 9: group that I convened

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.760
Speaker 9: initially formulated.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.260
Speaker 9: Matt Graham.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:11.340
Speaker 1: Perhaps, I mean obviously in the main papers what the Council members are seeing is the summary of what happened in the meeting. The report that Simon's referring to

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.720
Speaker 1: is in the resource centre.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:13.500
Speaker 1: Okay,

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.480
Speaker 9: thanks for that.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:22.160
Speaker 9: So we met initially a group that had the Associate Dean's Academic, Dean's

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.020
Speaker 9: PVC

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:30.600
Speaker 9: Education, PVC Māori, Teaching and Learning Director, Audrey Niu there as well.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:36.580
Speaker 9: And we met to consider those three areas indeed that the Vice-Chancellor outlined.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:38.400
Speaker 9: We

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.480
Speaker 9: wrote

00:40:40.480 --> 00:41:08.340
Speaker 9: out some recommendations that we then took to two different groups, certainly to the Senate meeting, as the Vice-Chancellor indicated. But before that, we had the opportunity, I had the opportunity to attend all six faculties that, thanks very much to their deans, organised special meetings, faculty meetings, half of these were online and half of them were live. And I took the six recommendations

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:27.080
Speaker 9: to those meetings, to really get feedback from colleagues directly, which indeed we did. We also had the opportunity to get further feedback after I talked to each of those meetings. A number of the faculties had subsequent discussions. Bridget and I both received a number of

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.900
Speaker 9: email

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:36.620
Speaker 9: correspondence. And indeed, we got feedback in the Senate meeting. Now, we've taken all that feedback together. We've had an initial

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.560
Speaker 9: re

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.340
Speaker 9: -meeting of

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:48.360
Speaker 9: the review group that happened the Friday week before last. We accumulate really working through all that feedback

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.460
Speaker 9: and

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.720
Speaker 9: making a series of suggestions. I guess these,

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.940
Speaker 9: the

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:04.700
Speaker 9: basis for these suggestions are summarised in the recommendations and really looking at I guess the three areas the Vice-Chancellor pointed out.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.000
Speaker 9: the

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.400
Speaker 9: TDA

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:38.340
Speaker 9: course

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:43.160
Speaker 9: experience in working in groups from multiple disciplinary perspectives.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.300
Speaker 9: Really

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.280
Speaker 9: addressing those sorts of problems that they will

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.220
Speaker 9: be

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.060
Speaker 9: asked to work with in their future careers. How successful are these?

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.040
Speaker 9: Also

00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:08.340
Speaker 9: looking at the distribution of students as part of running WTR and the TD courses. How are these students distributed across the faculties and are there any issues that the university needs to

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:16.660
Speaker 9: look at in terms of budgets, that sort of thing. And as Dawn points out, also looking

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.040
Speaker 9: at

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.500
Speaker 9: the flexi-choice

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.460
Speaker 9: options,

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:23.560
Speaker 9: really I guess looking at

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.080
Speaker 9: the

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.760
Speaker 9: breadth of education, how are we

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.460
Speaker 9: introducing

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:38.340
Speaker 9: students to those critical areas like indeed critical thinking with the ability to take courses from a variety of areas. So

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:46.840
Speaker 9: As the Vice-Chancellor pointed out, this is a work in progress. We've had a lot of feedback. It was really useful, I found, going to the

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.020
Speaker 9: faculty

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:54.720
Speaker 9: meetings, talking to colleagues directly. We got a lot of really useful feedback. I tried in all of those

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.980
Speaker 9: conversations

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:08.340
Speaker 9: with the assistants of the deans in each case to give colleagues the maximum opportunity to ask me questions and indeed provide feedback. There were no

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:14.140
Speaker 9: It was all just conversation. And I think that was turned out to be a really useful

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.100
Speaker 9: mechanism.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:28.960
Speaker 9: The deans at the Senate meeting summarised the feedback they'd received from each of the six faculties. So each dean presented at Senate. And as I say,

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.420
Speaker 9: our

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:35.140
Speaker 9: next task is really to collate all that information, go back and look at the recommendations

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.540
Speaker 9: and

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.560
Speaker 9: make adjustments.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:45.540
Speaker 9: I just wanted to kind of chance if I could just right at the end. Council members will be aware that there's a lot of

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.880
Speaker 9: information

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.260
Speaker 9: flowing around in the media and a lot of this is

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.840
Speaker 9: I

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.860
Speaker 9: guess quite disturbing because it is false,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:53.680
Speaker 9: really

00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:05.400
Speaker 9: is false information. I listened to the news 2ZB talk show early Friday morning and the presenter had really no idea about

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.140
Speaker 9: any

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.300
Speaker 9: of the content of the WTO.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:17.120
Speaker 9: of course, indeed the presenter had no idea what the name meant, which was quite surprising. Fortunately, Gabriel, our AUSA president,

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.800
Speaker 9: replied

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.260
Speaker 9: and

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.080
Speaker 9: very

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.720
Speaker 9: elegantly pointed out

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720
Speaker 9: to

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:29.500
Speaker 9: the presenter that that individual really had no idea about what they were talking about and then really laid out the

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.400
Speaker 9: basis

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:38.120
Speaker 9: for the W2. Of course, council members will be really aware. There's a really important set of courses, indeed there are five,

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:51.000
Speaker 9: for the different faculties. That fulfil a really important need for our students. Introducing a COVID generation, largely, of school leavers to the university, to the different

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.040
Speaker 9: areas

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:57.240
Speaker 9: of the university in terms of the way we teach, the way we research. And

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.240
Speaker 9: providing an

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.200
Speaker 9: introduction to

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.120
Speaker 9: the

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.860
Speaker 9: context in which we

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.200
Speaker 9: sit.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.340
Speaker 9: That is, we talk about

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:27.520
Speaker 9: and this is of course as colleagues will know better than I really essential and a large number of professions into which our students will work you know it's required an education for instance engineering in the clinical schools in FMHS so the courses

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.740
Speaker 9: we

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:38.340
Speaker 9: spent a lot of time working on these courses designing them we've piloted one WTR course in science with spectacular

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.120
Speaker 9: outcomes

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:39.700
Speaker 9: that

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.420
Speaker 9: I

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:43.600
Speaker 9: think they're around 170 students they really really enjoyed it

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.240
Speaker 9: and

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.840
Speaker 9: indeed we're seeing enrollments into all five of them

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.940
Speaker 9: this

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:54.100
Speaker 9: this year which has shown that students enrolling in all these courses

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.360
Speaker 9: so

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.720
Speaker 9: I just think we need to be aware that there is a lot of disinformation out there which is

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.740
Speaker 9: pretty

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.400
Speaker 9: disheartening I guess but perhaps in this

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.160
Speaker 9: in

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.340
Speaker 9: this modern world maybe not surprising and

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:08.480
Speaker 9: to

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.900
Speaker 9: do

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.980
Speaker 9: what we do really well, which is provide a range of really excellent courses.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:15.220
Speaker 9: Thank

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:15.440
Speaker 9: you.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.220
Thank

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.140
Speaker 1: you very much, Simon. Dawn.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.100
Sorry,

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:38.340
Speaker 7: could I just ask a couple of other comments? Because when I asked for the extra work on FlexiChoice, I was concerned about critical thinking, given the conversations we've been having and the COVID generation. And Simon, one of the key issues that gets talked about in the media and across the

00:47:38.380 --> 00:48:00.340
Speaker 7: the board is the course being compulsory and a treaty course. Could you just say a little bit about the work you've been doing on that? Because I think that's important for council to hear as well. Because those conversations and we're talking about what the expectation is and where this sits in the broader context.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:03.980
Thanks

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:08.340
Speaker 9: Dawn. Yeah I think that maybe the word compulsory has been a bit overused

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.080
Speaker 9: in

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:25.880
Speaker 9: connection, you know, these courses are part of the structure of the degree and we thought really carefully about this. I've tried to use the word required rather than compulsory. You know, are courses required in all our degrees? Of course they,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:26.700
Speaker 9: because

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:32.920
Speaker 9: all our degrees are structured in the way that we introduce students to

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:34.540
Speaker 9: necessary

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.220
Speaker 9: sets of knowledge and indeed build on these throughout the degree.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:49:08.340
Speaker 9: So I guess, you know, in that sense, maybe these courses can be thought of as compulsory, but in that in this in the notion of a structured degree, I don't see them as any more compulsory than any other course. So again, I prefer that kind of required approach. I'll start so in terms of, you know, the breadth of education, I think that's a really important point that we need as colleagues to think

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.860
Speaker 9: and indeed that was the intention

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.700
Speaker 9: of

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:19.000
Speaker 9: elements of the transdisciplinary futures courses. What we've done is to suggest that

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:19.700
Speaker 9: we

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:38.340
Speaker 9: keep a number of those courses continuing in a pilot form for this year and indeed next year. Go back and re-look at the general education courses, a curated set of those that indeed injuries some of the breadth issues that we know our

00:49:38.360 --> 00:50:00.220
Speaker 9: students are going to need to come to grips with in their futures. You pointed out a couple of times in this meeting the significance of AI and the way that artificial intelligence generative AI in particular is going to have an impact on our students moving forward. And indeed we can see elements of that happening

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.440
Speaker 9: already

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:06.520
Speaker 9: in the workforce in a number of different areas. So having that

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:08.340
Speaker 9: breadth

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:30.320
Speaker 9: Ability in critical thinking, in ability in querying, Gen AI, for example, going to be key aspects of the future of our students. So we need to look at the range of courses that we offer in all disciplines to fulfill those needs. I was on a high school board recently

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.120
Speaker 9: and

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:36.040
Speaker 9: I queried the headmaster about whether AI was part of the strategy of that

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.800
Speaker 9: high

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.060
Speaker 9: school.

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.280
Speaker 9: And indeed the headmaster

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.260
Speaker 9: said,

00:50:40.320 --> 00:51:05.840
Speaker 9: oh, we don't really need it. There was a young student on the board who immediately piped up, excuse me, headmaster, all of the boys are using AI to help with education. That is the reality that our students are already in. And we need to think very carefully about breadth components in our degrees, in all of our degrees that reflect that reality.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.820
True. Right.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:36.200
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might help us to understand. So if, as you say, there's been a lot of in the press about the WTR course being compulsory. And as you say, you prefer to think of it as a requirement in the same way that I mean, when I do my law degree, it was a requirement that you did criminal law and torts and all those sorts of things, which I believe are still requirements. But can I ask you,

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.080
Speaker 1: if

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.140
Speaker 1: somebody doesn't

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.440
Speaker 1: do this course in their first year,

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.680
Speaker 1: does

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:55.600
Speaker 1: this have, does this stop them from progressing into the second year? I mean, what's the, you know, are they, does, I mean, I understand they won't have the skill set, we are concerned they won't have the skill set,

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.300
Speaker 1: but isn't

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:03.560
Speaker 1: it true that they could not do the course, but they could still, and they would still be able to progress?

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:04.600
So

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.140
Speaker 9: I guess we do need to look at the intention of this course, as you say, very

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:08.920
Speaker 9: This

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.740
Speaker 9: course

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:15.100
Speaker 9: is intended for beginning students, gives them a hot basis of

00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.440
Speaker 9: abilities

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.220
Speaker 9: that will

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.100
Speaker 9: really lend, give

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:27.980
Speaker 9: them a much better chance of progressing through our degree. So we really want them to take that.

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:28.720
Speaker 9: Now

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:36.440
Speaker 9: I imagine there's going to be some instances where that's not going to happen and we will see a very small number of students,

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:50.840
Speaker 9: a variety of reasons, particular reasons end up taking the course in a second year. So it's not the intention to block students. If we kind of reverse the argument, I guess.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:51.680
Speaker 9: The

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:59.180
Speaker 9: intention is for students to gain skill sets that will enable them to succeed in university. And of course, that's

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.060
Speaker 9: really

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:06.220
Speaker 9: what we want to see happen for a whole range of reasons. So I do.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.840
Speaker 1: I appreciate you'd like them to do it but

00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.480
Speaker 1: yeah

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.680
Speaker 1: yeah I

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.160
think

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:38.140
Speaker 7: the point is that you know some people actually will join the university in their second year and they won't have access to this course and they'll progress and so I think you know what Simon's saying is that it's like any of these things we of course we would prefer them to learn about critical thinking and how to study and how to be in cohorts and all of those things but if there's going to be people that don't do it for whatever reason and that's not going to block

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:38.660
Speaker 7: that progression.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:54:01.860
Speaker 5: So sorry, to clarify, I mean, because I'm sorry, Simon, maybe I misunderstood you. When you talk about required versus compulsory, I think you're being, I would say some people might say you've been cute. It's the same thing. So is it absolutely clear that as a student, and this is what the controversy is, that people can't, I appreciate

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:02.780
Speaker 5: the

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:06.180
Speaker 5: intent behind the course may well be well intended.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:14.660
Speaker 5: But as I understand the controversy is that when people get to the point that they come to university they want to be free to choose what courses they undertake.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:15.800
Speaker 5: So

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:23.800
Speaker 5: if I decide I do not want to do this course and I want to complete my law degree, can I complete my law degree without having done this course?

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.060
If

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:30.080
Speaker 9: you come in as a beginning student, no you can't, we do want you to do

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:30.220
Speaker 2: that.

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:36.160
Speaker 5: Well I think that is the area that remains controversial Cecilia

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.180
Speaker 5: and controversial.

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.000
Yeah,

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.940
Speaker 1: no, I appreciate that, Cathy. Dawn, could you answer?

00:54:44.259 --> 00:54:45.940
Speaker 1: I think if you pick

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:54.420
Speaker 7: law, which is what you've done, one of the things that we're also doing is complying with what the professions are asking us to do. Simon, you better just

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.340
Speaker 7: talk

00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:03.700
Speaker 7: to me about this. But this is, you know, that's an important part also. So if we're building in with the professions,

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:19.100
Speaker 7: the competencies and the skills that they're asking us to build in, then there are some areas. Engineering is the same. I'm pulling it off here somewhere, Simon. Engineering particularly has the same thing with

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.880
Speaker 7: the

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:26.460
Speaker 7: engineering fraternity and their professional accrediting body. Do you want to just, maybe you just have a

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:27.660
Speaker 7: comment

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:28.560
Speaker 7: about that?

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:31.120
Yeah,

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.200
Speaker 9: certainly. So

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.360
Speaker 9: these,

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.160
Speaker 9: the

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.540
Speaker 9: The Waipapa Tamaturo course

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.660
Speaker 9: forces,

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:45.680
Speaker 9: because there are five of them, and indeed there's a comment that law does not have one, that is true. We expect students

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.720
Speaker 9: that

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.580
Speaker 9: enter into the second year of law

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.300
Speaker 9: will

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:50.600
Speaker 9: have

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.300
Speaker 9: picked

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.580
Speaker 9: up a Waipapa Tamaturo course from one of the other five areas.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:55.540
Speaker 9: Many

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.260
Speaker 9: law students

00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:00.540
Speaker 9: do dual

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.240
Speaker 9: majors, dual degrees, we expect them to pick up

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:03.920
Speaker 9: the

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.160
Speaker 9: course

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:10.780
Speaker 9: most logically in the faculty that they're doing their other major in.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.300
Speaker 9: But

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.980
Speaker 9: we do ask that students

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.440
Speaker 9: complete

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.880
Speaker 9: this course, as the Vice-Chancellor puts out, for a number of reasons.

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.380
Speaker 9: One

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:34.160
Speaker 9: of these reasons is that we've designed these courses to introduce students to the University. But in addition, these courses provide basic knowledge of te te riti te wa Māori that is a requirement

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:47.740
Speaker 9: in many professional degrees. Engineering, Vice Chancellor, you pointed out is indeed one of them. Education, nursing that you would know better than I. Undoubtedly there are other medical professional courses. So,

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:54.300
Speaker 1: you know, we... And Julia is pointing out in the chat that it is a requirement of the Council for Legal Education. Exactly.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.120
Speaker 10: I was

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.640
Speaker 5: using law as an example, right? I was using law as an example, so...

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:01.960
And

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:03.560
Speaker 1: I appreciate that, Cathy.

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:18.080
Speaker 1: I appreciate that. But so if it's not right, so can we just be clear, if it's not a requirement of the particular degree, you know, so let's say I'm doing an arts degree

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.460
Speaker 1: and

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:23.960
Speaker 1: I choose not to do this course, I

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.040
Speaker 1: thought

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:33.400
Speaker 1: I could, I can do, and I will still have, there'll be other requirements I have to have, right, a gen ed requirement or whatever,

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.740
Speaker 1: But can I fill those requirements other ways and still get my degree?

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:43.000
Speaker 9: You will need to do the Waipapa Tamaturo course. You will need also to do

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.860
Speaker 9: a TD or

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.980
Speaker 9: Gen Ed course and we are

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.320
Speaker 9: for

00:57:50.320 --> 00:58:00.260
Speaker 9: this year and for next year flexing that requirement in the sense that you have to do one or the other. But you know you will also have to do 120 points

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.100
Speaker 9: in

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.160
Speaker 9: the third year to get your major

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:04.640
Speaker 9: MS TOO:

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:17.520
Speaker 1: We do appreciate that. We just wanted to clarify that. Okay. So, yeah, so I think we've got the answer to your question, Cathy, right now. Whaa,

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.540
Speaker 1: do

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:19.060
Speaker 1: you have a question?

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:20.120
MR TOOME: Yeah,

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.840
Speaker 2: and it's just regarding Waipa Putaumata Rau. So it's just

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:25.880
Speaker 2: confirming

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:32.760
Speaker 2: again, you know, te hao Māori and Tikang is only one component in that Waipa Putaumata Rau course. And just,

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:55.640
Speaker 2: Again, to confirm and for those watching our proceedings, it's in regards to sort of Waipa Patoumata Ro replacing general education and in part solving some of our, you know, allocating funding, you know, that a student might have tied to their specific course. That was my understanding from a...

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.320
Speaker 2: So,

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:03.940
Speaker 2: for instance, a med student might have to do Waipa Patoumata Ro, but they might do Waipa Patoumata Ro in arts.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:11.680
Speaker 2: and then a portion of their funding might go to the Arts Faculty, for example. That's my understanding as well. Greg?

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:16.040
Speaker 9: So we would expect a

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.500
Speaker 9: student

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:34.160
Speaker 9: in Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences to do the Waipapa Tamaturo course in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences. There's a bunch of reasons for that, right? Obviously that course has been designed by colleagues from that faculty to introduce

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.020
Speaker 9: students

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.520
Speaker 9: to

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:40.880
Speaker 9: the nature of teaching and research in that faculty. And each of the

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.220
Speaker 9: Waipapa

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:57.940
Speaker 9: Tamaturo courses has some common content, but is slanted unsurprisingly to the nature of research and teaching in each of the five faculties. Laura is the exception as we've explained.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:14.180
Speaker 1: Are there any other questions? And obviously, look, this is a review that's ongoing and I think that this is a point that can continue to be looked at. Julia, you had a question?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:16.920
Yes,

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:23.200
Speaker 4: sorry. More just a little comment and a bit of a plea. So some of the staff

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:23.740
Speaker 4: that

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:28.880
Speaker 4: were putting together, put quite a lot of work into rolling out the next transdisciplinary

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.720
Speaker 4: tranche

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:34.160
Speaker 4: of courses have been told that

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:39.420
Speaker 4: We didn't financially model those initiatives and we now realise we can't afford them. And so it's really a plea

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.080
Speaker 4: when

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:45.240
Speaker 4: we do blue skies thinking, when we do strategic planning, could we do the financial modelling very early on?

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.660
Speaker 9: Yes, that's

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.240
Speaker 9: absolutely

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.520
Speaker 9: a

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.400
Speaker 9: good

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.360
Speaker 9: comment and indeed

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.540
Speaker 9: understanding

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:04.160
Speaker 9: the modelling is critical. I would just point out to colleagues and again, Council Members

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.100
Speaker 9: the whole

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.040
Speaker 9: curriculum

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.760
Speaker 9: framework transformation program was started three or four years ago. And

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.400
Speaker 9: our

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.620
Speaker 9: financial position

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.700
Speaker 9: and

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:32.640
Speaker 9: indeed the country's financial position has shifted quite substantially. So these models need to be dynamic. And indeed, with the help of my colleague Pamela Moss, that's exactly what we've done

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.620
Speaker 9: moving

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.020
Speaker 9: forward.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:34.660
Speaker 11: And

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:39.220
Speaker 9: I've talked to the colleagues involved in transdisciplinary courses.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.780
Speaker 9: I've

01:01:40.780 --> 01:02:01.840
Speaker 9: talked directly to the course directors on some of the courses that will be affected by the pause that we have while we understand the distribution of students across the faculties a little bit better in those transdisciplinary course areas and indeed understand how we could develop a curated set of general education courses.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:30.220
Speaker 9: is really, really good. We just need to perhaps slow things down a little bit to give ourselves a chance to rebalance, recognising absolutely, and again as council members will know better than I, the difficulties that we face, the challenges I guess I should call them, that we face coming from current government funding levels. Not only that, in

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.620
the

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.940
Speaker 10: media this morning was David Seymour,

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:37.440
Speaker 10: was expressing his disappointment at Auckland University

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.040
Speaker 10: for

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.760
Speaker 10: not complying with the government's

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.420
Speaker 10: degree

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:49.220
Speaker 10: that these courses that we are

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:50.860
Speaker 10: supposed

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:59.940
Speaker 10: to be making people do, he needs to change the council of this place. Did you see that?

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:06.420
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've all seen it. Yeah. But I think that is a misunderstanding of

01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.940
Speaker 1: how small

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:17.080
Speaker 1: a portion the tititi, the talmar part of it is. Anyway,

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.740
Speaker 1: we're

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:24.200
Speaker 1: not going to change David Seymour's views right there.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:25.420
Can

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:30.160
Speaker 7: I just go back to Julia's question? Because I do want to flag up with

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:42.080
Speaker 7: I was very aware then

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.960
Speaker 7: that

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:55.800
Speaker 7: there was some work further work that needed to be done and understood because let's be honest this is you know there's no doubt that our students need access to transdisciplinary opportunities that that there's no doubt about that how that's done

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.280
Speaker 7: and

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.160
Speaker 7: how that's led and managed and taught

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:12.740
Speaker 7: is done in different ways in different institutions. And, and I think you know we had some people who have very and great enthusiasm, great ideas and ways of thinking about this.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:13.640
Speaker 7: But

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:24.180
Speaker 7: for all all the reasons you just pointed out whenever we develop programs across the university, there has to be a business case that it's not just about the academic business case.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.140
Speaker 7: And

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:38.840
Speaker 7: so I think it's right to point that out and I think it's a really important comment you've made and I just want to underline it because it's not just about TD it's about a range of things that we could engage in but not necessarily think about

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.720
Speaker 7: the

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:49.580
Speaker 7: you know the importance of not just financial modelling but infrastructure and capability and workforce planning so thank you for that comment.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:05:02.240
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. I'm conscious of time here. I think we've, are there any other questions in respect of the matters of the report on the Senate meeting?

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:04.760
Speaker 1: Okay,

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:10.080
Speaker 1: if there are no other matters, I'm then going to move

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.000
Speaker 1: that

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.700
Speaker 1: the recommendation in part A of the report, so this is the recommendations in part A which relate to the reviews,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.820
Speaker 1: that's

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.640
Speaker 1: the thing that they be adopted.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.460
Speaker 1: and

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.200
Speaker 1: that those in Part B and C

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.340
Speaker 1: be

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:26.740
Speaker 1: noted.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.400
Speaker 1: All

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.100
Speaker 1: right. I'm going to move that

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:30.840
Speaker 1: and

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:46.220
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask Candice if she will second that. Thank you very much, Candice. And all in favour, right, so adoption and noting. Thank you very much. Anybody against? Good. Thank you very much.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.240
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:48.740
Speaker 1: Now,

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:51.820
Speaker 1: There

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.800
Speaker 1: then

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:54.840
Speaker 1: I have,

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.020
Speaker 1: with

01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:21.760
Speaker 1: respect to correspondence referred by the Chancellor, I've explained that all of the correspondence that we have received in respect of the proposed combination of the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Business Economics will be made available to the Council in the Resource Centre. Now we're going to the other matters for decision and noting and we're going now to the

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:41.640
Speaker 1: to the seal. There are one document in which the seal has been affixed since our last meeting, which is the Deed of Novation and Variation Information Sharing Agreement for the Growing Up in New Zealand study, which is between UniServices, University of Auckland and the Ministry of Education,

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.720
Speaker 1: which

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:47.940
Speaker 1: I'm excited about, because that means that they're funding, that they're going on, right? So

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.100
Speaker 1: just

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:49.980
Speaker 1: wonderful.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:50.920
Speaker 1: So

01:06:50.920 --> 01:07:18.440
Speaker 1: I'm going to move that that be noted. If there's any discussion with that. Okay. And I'll ask Julia and Otnene to second that. Thank you very much. And we will then, all those in favour. Nobody against. Thank you. Now I'm moving to the program limitations. And now this is a little confusing, right, because we are now in 2025.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:44.420
Speaker 1: What we are actually doing is we are noting the use of the provost subdelegation powers that were used in 2024 to approve an update to the program limitations of these two programs for 2025. We no longer have a provost but this was what she did when she was the provost and so we need to note it.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.480
Speaker 1: Are

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.020
Speaker 1: there any questions around these programs?

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.800
Speaker 1: the changes to the program limitations.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.540
Speaker 1: All good.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:08:08.640
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm going to move that council note the use of the proper subdelegation powers to approve the update to these program limitations and I'm going to ask Dawn to second that.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.060
Speaker 1: Thank you very much, Dawn.

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:12.080
Speaker 1: All those in favour?

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.480
Speaker 1: Anybody against?

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.500
Speaker 1: Good.

01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:17.640
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

01:08:18.259 --> 01:08:48.100
Speaker 1: Now, we now have the MOU, the memorandum standing between the University of Auckland and the foundations. And you'll see there's a cover memo there from Tim about it. I think we can take this as read. I mean, effectively, as he's explaining, this is around the university providing administrative support to the foundation, which obviously does a lot of good for the university. Are there any questions for Tim around the MOU?

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:49.020
Speaker 1: with the Foundation?

01:08:51.839 --> 01:08:52.440
Speaker 1: No?

01:08:52.549 --> 01:08:55.580
Speaker 1: All good? Well then I will move that

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.339
Speaker 1: the

01:08:57.339 --> 01:09:09.980
Speaker 1: Council approve the adoption of the refreshed MOU with the University Foundations and delegate to the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor to execute the MOU. And, Fah, could I ask you to second that please?

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.259
Speaker 1: Thank

01:09:11.259 --> 01:09:12.200
Speaker 1: you very much.

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:12.980
Speaker 1: All

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.880
Speaker 1: those in favour?

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:15.680
Speaker 1: Anybody

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.540
Speaker 1: against?

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:40.839
Speaker 1: Thank you. Okay, so then we're going to go to the Senate and Committee Election Statute. And you will see that this is a proposed update to the statute that reflects the changes made to the Senate membership which were approved by Council at its meeting in December. And these really only relate to the sub-professorial staff

01:09:40.839 --> 01:09:41.759
Speaker 1: and

01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:48.240
Speaker 1: were made as a result of changing the

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:54.980
Speaker 1: the change in the faculties, I believe is what came with this. Now, Julia, do you have a question on this?

01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:57.220
Speaker 1: I

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.400
Speaker 1: have a comment that most

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.960
Speaker 4: of that is true. So the change to sub-professorial

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.600
Speaker 4: membership

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:12.980
Speaker 4: on Senate and the updates to legislation. But I think there might have been an error in that we also remove,

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.160
Speaker 4: so

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.340
Speaker 4: I'm looking at page 57 of diligent,

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.580
Speaker 4: we

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.240
Speaker 4: remove

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:32.020
Speaker 4: the wording about Senate that includes all the professors as well as representatives of sub-professorial staff, professional staff and students and that isn't an update and hasn't been through Senate so

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.200
Speaker 4: it's

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.620
Speaker 4: really not something that we can

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.500
Speaker 4: vote

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:42.160
Speaker 4: on without the advice of Senate so my suggestion would just be to put those words back in

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.360
Speaker 4: and

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.220
Speaker 4: then it is an update.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:55.080
Speaker 7: Can I just clarify, this was raised with me as well last week. Adrian, do you want, and I know we've spoken with Wendy about it, do you want to just advise?

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:57.540
Well

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.200
Speaker 6: I think the change to the definition of Senate

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.160
Speaker 6: is

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:09.980
Speaker 6: still true, it just now reflects the change in the Education Act which moves it to Schedule 11

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.500
Speaker 6: rather

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.660
Speaker 6: than the previous reference. It doesn't make any

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.720
Speaker 6: Indication here

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.380
Speaker 6: at

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:24.700
Speaker 6: all about the membership of Senate. The membership of Senate is in the terms of reference of Senate and we haven't made any changes to the membership of Senate

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.640
Speaker 6: other

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.040
Speaker 6: than the change that

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:34.680
Speaker 4: was... This is not an update for the legislation because those words weren't in the previous legislation either. I just think we should run that through Senate. So

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:43.920
Speaker 1: just a minute Julia, we're referring to the 2020 Act, you want us to go, you're suggesting that we go back to referring to the Education Act 1989?

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.300
Speaker 4: is just to reflect changes in the act. I'm saying there wasn't,

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:50.300
Speaker 4: this

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.820
Speaker 4: wasn't. There's a new act.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:52.620
Speaker 4: Yes,

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:53.520
Speaker 4: I know. Right.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:54.340
Speaker 4: But

01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:01.580
Speaker 4: the old act doesn't have these words either. They were in the statute. So we're taking them out. We're doing something that's more than updating.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:08.620
Speaker 5: But does it matter, Julia? I'm, I mean, I'm looking at it. Just in the definitions. It doesn't matter because it's the

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:12.940
Speaker 4: only council statute that refers to the senators including all the professors.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.780
Speaker 5: It just defines it as the committee established by council

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.780
Speaker 5: under

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:22.860
Speaker 5: the act. I don't think it's a big deal.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.080
Speaker 5: And

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.840
Speaker 4: it includes all the professors.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:25.920
That

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.440
Speaker 5: is a big deal. That's part of our history

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.880
Speaker 5: at

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.060
Speaker 5: this

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.860
Speaker 4: place. And if we were going to change that

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.340
Speaker 1: definition...

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.360
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, Julia. Julia.

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.200
Speaker 6: We're not changing that.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:43.420
Speaker 1: We're not trying to change it. We're not trying to change it that the professors are on Senate. We're not trying to change that.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:43.980
Speaker 1: But

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:53.480
Speaker 4: you're removing it from the statute without the advice of Senate. I would just suggest putting those words back in. That's neutral and then it just is an update.

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:54.940
So

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.660
Speaker 7: it's an update of the elections statute.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:05.320
Speaker 4: The only statute in which we define Senate as including all academics in this,

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.340
Speaker 4: sorry,

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.360
Speaker 4: all professors in this university.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.800
Speaker 6: of reference for Senate.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:17.000
Speaker 4: Terms of reference isn't a statute.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.200
So

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:26.160
Speaker 7: I'm just confused because I thought this was about the election of sub-professorial staff, not professorial staff.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.160
It

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:28.900
Speaker 6: is. And

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:43.660
Speaker 4: that went through Senate. There's no problem with that. I'm looking at the last two words and just saying the last two lines of the document on page 57, the words, it includes all the professors as well as representatives of sub-professorial staff.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.620
Speaker 4: staff, professional staff and students. Just keeping that rather than knocking it out.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:51.480
Speaker 4: On

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.220
Speaker 4: page 57 of Diligent. I

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:01.700
Speaker 6: don't see it makes any difference. I don't think it needs to be there, but happy to have it there.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.440
Okay.

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:10.300
Speaker 1: Okay, so why don't you then, Julia, that you move that an amendment may be made

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.000
Speaker 1: to

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.500
Speaker 1: add back in.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.560
Speaker 1: It includes

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.220
Speaker 1: all

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:17.640
Speaker 1: the professors as well as etc.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:18.480
Speaker 1: And then,

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:19.600
Speaker 1: okay,

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.680
Speaker 1: and on that basis, I'll move that

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.420
Speaker 11: council

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:25.780
Speaker 1: approve.

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.120
Speaker 1: Sorry, Dawn?

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:28.480
Oh,

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.640
Speaker 7: there's a whole paragraph there.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.020
Speaker 7: It's not just about professors.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:31.940
Speaker 7: So I'm just asking.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.040
Speaker 7: No, no, no,

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:33.820
Speaker 1: that's what I'm saying.

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:34.940
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, no, I'm going to go.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.900
Speaker 1: It includes all the professors as well as representatives

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.220
Speaker 1: of sub-profissorial staff, professional staff and students.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:42.660
Speaker 1: I'm

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:51.400
Speaker 1: going to add that language into after 2020 on page 57 right and then the rest of it is

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.680
Speaker 4: completely innocuous because that's what's been through Senate and signed off by council so it is just an update

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.100
okay

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:06.660
Speaker 1: so and on that basis I'll move that council approve the update and Julia will you second that yes

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.140
Speaker 1: so

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.660
Speaker 1: okay all those in

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.560
favor

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.520
Anybody

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:21.540
Speaker 1: against? Right. Good. Okay. We have no elections. Is there any general business that anybody wishes to bring to part A of the meeting?

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:26.160
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:32.120
Speaker 1: All good. Okay. Is anybody requesting a leave of absence for the meeting of the 28th of April?

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.080
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:41.560
Speaker 1: If you do need a leave of absence, perhaps if you could just notify Wendy of the

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.800
Speaker 1: So now I'm going to move that the public be excluded from part B of this meeting

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.180
Speaker 1: and

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.000
Speaker 1: as a result
