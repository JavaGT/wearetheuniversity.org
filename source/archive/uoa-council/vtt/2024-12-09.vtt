WEBVTT

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:38.960
Speaker 1: The election. Right. Yep, that's right. Okay, we'll vote that far. Thank you.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.120
And

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.760
Speaker 1: I'll move that those disclosures be noted. I'll get Gemma to second that. Thank you very much, Gemma.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.580
All

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.420
Speaker 1: right, then we're in the Council Minutes. We have the Minutes of Part A there. We're up to the end of Part A, which is the part open to the public.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.440
We

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.540
Speaker 1: have the Minutes of Part A. Are there any comments

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.980
around

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:17.160
Speaker 2: I do have a comment. I think we could have used Section 18 of the Council appointment process procedure not to seek expressions of interest

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.180
when

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.880
Speaker 2: we reacquired to the current alumni member but I don't think we did.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.100
So

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.520
Speaker 2: where are you in the minutes?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.260
Speaker 1: Page 16.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.120
Speaker 1: Page 16.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.220
Speaker 1: It's

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.020
Speaker 1: We

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.540
Speaker 2: have to look at the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.940
Speaker 3: page.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.100
Speaker 2: Page 14.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.400
Speaker 2: Yeah.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.900
Well,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.380
Speaker 2: what I'm saying is we put it in the should've, but I don't mean that we did.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.040
Speaker 2: Ah,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.920
right,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.240
Speaker 2: yeah.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.660
Speaker 2: Okay.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.920
Speaker 2: That is something just as a matter of rise. I'm

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.200
with

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780
Speaker 2: Wendy's support looking into that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.520
and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.620
Speaker 2: we'll complete that when Wendy is back and leave.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.940
Speaker 1: So it will be in January. Thank you for raising it.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.600
Right,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.780
Speaker 1: so we should add that as a matter of rise.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.660
Yeah,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:45.700
Speaker 1: I'm with you, I'm with you, Julia. Yep, okay. Then I will, with that amendment, I will move that the minutes be taken as read and confirmed, and I will ask

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.940
the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.700
Speaker 1: Vice-Chancellor just to second those.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.700
Thank

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.780
Speaker 1: you very much.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.560
Speaker 1: All right, we'll move to the November, the e-meeting that was done by email.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.960
Are

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.700
Speaker 1: there any questions around those minutes?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.240
All

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.760
Speaker 1: right, I will move that they

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.680
be

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.960
Speaker 1: taken as read and confirmed. And Julia, perhaps I could ask you to second those. Thank you.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.240
Okay,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.980
Speaker 1: we have the matters of, we have no

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.660
Speaker 1: So there's no matters horizon where the matters horizon that we will have added

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.980
there. Okay,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:49.360
Speaker 1: we are now at the confirmative degrees. So by the authority vested in me by the University of Auckland, I, Cecilia Tarrant, Chancellor, hereby vest the degrees that are listed for the confirmative degrees in the papers.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.960
Take

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.920
Speaker 1: those as

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.880
conferred.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.900
So

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.700
Speaker 1: then we're going to the Vice Chancellor's report.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.200
You're

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.880
Speaker 4: a Chancellor, thank you. So I'll take the report as read,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.720
as

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.060
Speaker 4: usual. I will just provide an update

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.440
and

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.420
Speaker 4: I won't rehearse everything that we've been talking around the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.200
two

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.540
Speaker 4: external reviews, the Science System Advisory Group review and the new AG review,

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:17.760
except

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.080
Speaker 4: to say that, for now we know that some elements of the Science System Advisory Group

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.140
paper

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.980
Speaker 4: have been

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.980
Speaker 4: and we're aware that some of those conversations have been taken with our research leads

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.060
and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.840
Speaker 4: particularly implications are now being announced for things like the Marsden

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.820
which

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.840
Speaker 4: impacts the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.680
research

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.740
Speaker 4: grant funding for art social science and humanities that is the open only openly contested

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.480
fund

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.100
Speaker 4: available in New Zealand and so there are concerns about

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.000
what

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.980
Speaker 4: that's going to mean specifically for our really highly

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.620
Speaker 4: RANKARDSI:

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.840
And

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.340
Speaker 4: we're now thinking about what we do in order to make sure that we continue to support

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.300
those

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.540
Speaker 4: disciplines beyond the work that we've already done through the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.460
bringing

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:23.020
Speaker 4: together arts and creative industries and education in one faculty, which has helped at least bring the scale and concentration together and to provide the support in the background for this work to go forward.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:33.940
Speaker 4: Minister has also indicated that future funding will be directed to incentivise graduates from hard sciences and STEM

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.980
with

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.740
Speaker 4: benefits to the New Zealand economy, particularly around high-tech and sciences. And whilst the decisions around

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.760
the

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:54.980
Speaker 4: discipline mix and how that mix will be funded in the future are still to be understood, there is talk in the meeting last week, Vice-Chancellor's with the Minister, around

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:10.200
Speaker 4: differentials and particularly driving existing funding, no extra funding, driving existing funding towards STEM disciplines, which of course will mean that we need to think carefully about anything that sits outside of that

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.980
in

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:24.300
Speaker 4: the university as a comprehensive university and one which understands the value of our comprehensiveness to societal issues around tech, AI and such demands.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:36.260
Speaker 4: So quite a lot of work to do around that. On the UAG work, the UAG is actually coming into the university this week. They'll be meeting with the Chancellor and myself on Thursday.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.460
I've

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:52.420
Speaker 4: already met with a number of people to talk through funding mechanisms and are meeting with some committee chairs. But that work has slowed down a little bit. It was due to report in February when we met with Peter Lutton last week.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.260
It

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:01.860
Speaker 4: looks like it's not going to report at least before March, probably later. And the Minister has to make some decisions before then.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.640
So

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.940
Speaker 4: once she's got the Cabinet paper off the table, and free speech legislation at the end of the year,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.320
she'll

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.080
Speaker 4: be moving to prioritise PBRF funding,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.200
which

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.780
Speaker 4: we're keen to make sure we understand. We are very aware that 4% funding that we were given

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.220
Speaker 4: for two years, 23 and 24,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.420
was

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:35.180
Speaker 4: not something we could bank on at the end of 2025. And we've had confirmation that we need to not factor that in

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.880
beyond

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.520
Speaker 4: 2025.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.000
So

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.380
Speaker 4: some quite dark challenges for us ahead of the two reviews really coming to fruition, still

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.300
waiting

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.400
Speaker 4: to understand what some of the detail of that really means.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.280
I

00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:03.300
Speaker 4: would like to just also acknowledge the fact that it's been such a big year for the universe. You've been hearing some of that in briefings. Highly successful year

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.060
in

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.780
Speaker 4: many ways and that's difficult

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.920
to

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.440
Speaker 4: actually portray those messages internally externally when we're dealing

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
with

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:22.780
Speaker 4: some quite challenging media and some cutting through with the evidence of how we've maintained and sustained

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.380
Speaker 4: in fact improved our rankings

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.600
over

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.340
Speaker 4: the last year as a world-class university in research and in teaching and learning

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.400
and

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:41.400
Speaker 4: to cut through some of the misinformation and the disinformation that's out there around this and of course our comms and marketing strategy is working hard with this

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.320
but

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.300
Speaker 4: the excellence in teaching and research has been really highly recognized

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.280
and

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.780
Speaker 4: can I commend all of our academic colleagues and all of our professional staff in fact the

00:08:52.820 --> 00:09:11.480
Speaker 4: community on helping us to achieve these significant outcomes. Again, year on year, we took early action, we continue to take early action. That is not without effort on everybody's part. And it means that we have to take some tough decisions and we're adding

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.640
before

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.800
Speaker 4: we're yet able to remove some of those things that we need to transit

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.840
out

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.760
Speaker 4: of and so it's

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.540
tough

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.060
Speaker 4: times.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.140
And

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:22.780
Speaker 4: that's for me an opportunity

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.700
Speaker 4: here around the council table to thank everybody in the community

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.640
for

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.340
Speaker 4: helping us get to this point again.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.220
A

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.820
Speaker 4: couple of other things I think just to note are

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.700
a

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:40.540
Speaker 4: hugely successful launch of the rec centre, a thousand people through in the first hour

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.380
and

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:52.780
Speaker 4: I'm seeing people march up and down Simon Street on their way to and from the rec centre and sometimes they're not going actually to use the gym, they're just going to be

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.880
Speaker 4: in there in that environment to use the facilities and it's a really fantastic environment

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.700
for

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.800
Speaker 4: people and particularly our students to be in

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.520
and

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.320
Speaker 4: we've seen a number of changes across the campus this year that have really enhanced

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.020
the

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.320
Speaker 4: student experience including our library learning services across a range of those

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.220
different

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:22.780
Speaker 4: including beta one of course which is now so densely populated that we need to rebuild it but not say that too loud and you know exciting

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:52.780
Speaker 4: I just want to comment on this I've mentioned a few times at this council table that we really need to get our heads around how it's going to change the whole sector not just elements of the sector and I've just come from the world AI summit which took place in Hong Kong but it brought together leaders from across 55 countries to really focus on a consensus of

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.800
Speaker 4: and how we're going to work together on AI collaboratively

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.660
as

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:22.320
Speaker 4: a suite of universities to ensure that our students, our researchers and our communities get the best outcomes from the education that they receive and are part of or contribute to in our institutions. And they're all top 100 universities, all at varying degrees, doing different things. That's very exciting opportunities for us to think about our futures here with optimism.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:37.740
Speaker 4: I'll leave it there and I'm happy to take comments or questions. Most of what's in the report will be provided to you but of course the whole team are here if you've got questions related to any of those four problems. Questions, obviously

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:47.840
Speaker 1: we've had a pretty good discussion around the strategic priorities and that sort of thing in the briefings but are there any questions specifically for Dawn on your report?

00:11:52.820 --> 00:12:05.260
Speaker 1: If possible around, I guess I noted one of the e-research strategies, five categories, and how they will be operationalized by next year.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.240
I'm

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.880
Speaker 1: wondering, are we

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.220
framing

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.840
Speaker 1: that strategy with a dedicated team? Yeah. So Frank's

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:22.780
Speaker 4: reshaped his portfolio. So we saw that Frank's done that. He's created three portfolios. One of those portfolios is responsible for the e-research strategies.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.580
Speaker 4: Research Strategy.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:31.000
Speaker 1: Okay, great. So we're not asking existing to do more. It's an exit. It's a whole team of people working on the research strategy. Thanks for that.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:32.880
Just

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.740
Speaker 1: one other comment with respect to AI.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.520
I

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.580
Speaker 1: wrote a guest article, I was asked to write a guest article for the Institute of Directors

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.280
publication

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.940
Speaker 1: coming out this summer on how

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:43.740
governors

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.240
Speaker 1: can

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.760
look

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.780
Speaker 1: at AI questions coming through. And one of the areas that I noted that we're really deficient in in New Zealand

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.020
are

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:59.860
Speaker 1: training courses for executives and professionals. So I cited in the article to come to the University of Auckland because we have a couple here.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:00.900
Is

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.440
Speaker 1: there a perspective or is there a plan, I think, for enterprises, particularly in New Zealand,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.520
where

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.600
Speaker 1: we could offer, you know, one, two, three, four courses for executives to actually

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.700
go

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.220
Speaker 1: through? Because no one's offering them really here. This sits in the working professional space.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.180
Speaker 4: So in the working professional space, along with Auckland Online,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.440
Thank you

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:03.220
Speaker 1: Dawn and I think we should thank you for all the work that you've put in this year and the rest of your executive and senior leadership team.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.840
So

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.480
Speaker 1: thank you very much. It's been a hard run and I know you're still running to the finish.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.560
Oh

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:21.580
Speaker 1: that's a finish. The finish of the year. Finish of the year.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:33.500
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Look, I'm going to move that the Vice-Councillor's report be noted and Candice ask you to second that. I do. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, now moving to the Finance Committee. Obviously, this is the

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.760
minutes

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:42.140
Speaker 1: of Part A of the Finance Committee. And are there any questions around the minutes of Part A of the Finance Committee?

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.280
One

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.880
Speaker 5: add, we have a big budget report in our pack. And I am assuming...

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.040
Speaker 1: We do and it's in Part B.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.240
Speaker 5: I'm assuming that the Finance Committee thoroughly

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.600
reviewed

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.940
Speaker 5: that. I guess I should ask in Part B.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.400
Speaker 1: You should ask in Part B, exactly. When you get to it.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.280
Speaker 1: When you get to it, yeah.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.260
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good answer.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:11.980
Speaker 1: Okay, right here. Okay, we'll move that the Finance Committee minutes be no... I'll move that they be received, and Rob, you can second that.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:12.500
Speaker 1: Sure.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:21.400
Speaker 1: Thank you. So then we'll go to the Audit and Risk Committee minutes. And any questions on those?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:28.220
Speaker 1: Right, Jonathan, I'm going to move that they be received. You can second that. Thank you.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:29.340
And

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:37.280
Speaker 1: then we're in the Capital Expenditure Committee. Are there any questions around the minutes? That's just the part A minutes, the Capital Expenditure Committee.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.780
I'll

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:44.160
Speaker 1: move that those be received. And, Bob, perhaps you'd like to second those.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.940
Thank

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.480
Speaker 1: you. So we're now at the Equity Leadership Committee, and we have Kathy here.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.400
and

00:15:52.400 --> 00:16:07.420
Speaker 1: you have the report there from the Equity Leadership Committee report as Cathy said. Lots of good detail in there. Thank you very much Cathy. I think we should take the report as read. Are there any questions for Cathy specifically around the report?

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:27.700
Speaker 4: gender paper mentions talking to some of the communities about maybe some of them. I appreciate their systemic issues.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:35.680
Speaker 3: Beyond talking to those communities on their own reflections, what other work are you doing? Because I appreciate the other ones, you know,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.720
besides

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.180
Speaker 3: the

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:37.800
paper.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:51.500
Speaker 3: Like what's the approach to try, think about how to approach that. Quite complex issue. You're right. It is very complex. And so already the analysis we've done have given us a bit of insight into where to target

00:16:51.540 --> 00:17:02.560
Speaker 3: efforts because the gender pay gap numbers, as you know, are just really big forward indicators. And so it tells us that despite all the good work that we've been doing for many years, there are still going to be pockets

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.500
in

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.380
Speaker 3: some parts of the organisation where

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.380
improvements

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:21.500
Speaker 3: can be made. And so one of the things, for example, that we've found is that HR has already undertaken a project to look at transparency around performance pay. So that the people who are making the decisions about that, then the area of

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.220
Speaker 3: responsibility can see their own patterns of decision making.

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:33.920
Speaker 3: We know from overseas research in particular that just making it visible,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.240
Speaker 3: their own pattern of decision making really helps people understand if they might have some unconscious biases

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.640
Speaker 3: that are skewed in one way or another. So that's the work HR are doing.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:50.820
Speaker 3: And to be fair, most of the initiatives to tackle this will be led by HR informed by this report.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.700
So

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.880
Speaker 3: we're fortunate in that there's some really good quality evidence bases around

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.960
what

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:16.520
Speaker 3: types of initiatives are most likely to be effective once you've correctly diagnosed what the underlying issues are. And so there's no one big thing that you can just do and magically it all comes right. So a lot of the hard work that's been done this year and is planning for next year is to continue a really detailed understanding of

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.080
where

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.740
Speaker 3: are the issues.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:18.620
At

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.800
Speaker 3: what point is it in the way we advertise

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:43.780
Speaker 3: Is it career progression? Is it more flexible work policies? Is it more flexible leave? There's a range of things that we can set up. At the same time, we also engage in the communities to understand what their experience is, so that when we think we've identified

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.840
a

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:50.800
Speaker 3: specific issue, we've got some good evidence-based intervention that we'd like to

00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:08.100
Speaker 3: We can collaborate with key communities involved to see what does that look like a sensible approach and how would you like to put us on that. So it's going to take a while. It's going to take 140 years to get here. But it's the only way I

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.300
take it.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.420
Speaker 1: Thank you

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.640
very

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:19.380
Speaker 1: much, Cathy. I'm going to move with that report we've received and Gemma asked you to second that. Thank you very much.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:30.160
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're on to the report of Senate. I don't know whether, Vice Chancellor, whether there's any comment you want to make of the papers that are in our

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.640
Speaker 4: pack?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.040
Just

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.680
Speaker 4: two comments before any questions and

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.380
others

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.000
Speaker 4: can comment.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.680
We

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.380
Speaker 4: have committed to going back to

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.320
the

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.900
Speaker 4: Senate meeting in March

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.820
with

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:50.040
Speaker 4: two pieces of work that we were going to do. One was in revisiting work from the CFT to look at transdisciplinary

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:59.140
Speaker 4: to think about that in a bit more detail, the regulations that we've gone through, but also to look at Wipe Up the Time After Row and actually one or two other areas where

00:19:59.140 --> 00:19:59.980
we

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:19.800
Speaker 4: realise that we need to think about things like flexible learning choices, the enhanced learning options, and to have an extended Senate that day to really help people to get across and understand inside out some of those issues. Because we've had a lot of people turn up to Senate that weren't actually at the Senate when those were.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.080
Speaker 4: Papers went through and to try and bring people up to speed on where we're at to get some debate going.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:25.940
The

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:34.240
Speaker 4: second thing was about free speech. That's actually going to probably be curtailed because free speech legislation, even though we've done all this work on policy,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.240
is

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:41.140
Speaker 4: going to go through Cabinet before the end of the year. And so we're likely to have to think about what that means for us

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.140
rather

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.940
Speaker 4: than developing a policy of our own.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:44.580
So

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.040
Speaker 4: the challenge for that meeting, where we put that on schedule again, I think

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:56.980
Speaker 4: It will then be unravelling what the legislation looks like and trying to understand the implications in terms of our own

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.440
work

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:04.100
Speaker 4: that we've been doing and how we apply it. And I don't know how much detail it's going to go into, but I do know that

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.820
there

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:11.460
Speaker 4: is going to be an expectation that there's going to be transparency and regular monitoring on a yearly basis for legislation and

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.140
for

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:19.860
Speaker 4: implementing it. So that's probably enough from me. So we've got an expanded meeting of Senate on the 3rd of March.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.540
Speaker 4: and that report and the work of that will come to the council meeting.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.440
I

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.160
Speaker 4: don't know if there's anything Bridget or anybody you want to add or any other questions.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.600
Are

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.800
Speaker 1: there any questions on the senate papers that are in the pack?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.060
I

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.500
Speaker 1: think we should all note the names of the new faculties.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.440
Speaker 1: Yes, we have the Faculty of Arts and Education who are acknowledging they are the A&E faculty.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.700
Speaker 1: and the Faculty of Engineering and Design.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.320
Okay.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:56.700
Speaker 1: All right.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.140
Speaker 1: I'll move that.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:05.280
Speaker 1: I'm moving that the recommendations in Part A of the Report of Senate be adopted and Parts B and C be noted.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.500
Speaker 1: Cathy, I'll ask you to second those.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.060
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:09.880
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.460
Speaker 1: Then we're down to the delegations to the PBC Global and Graduate Research.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:16.360
Speaker 1: And so I think this is really

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.060
sort

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.960
Speaker 1: of a name change, isn't it?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.100
Speaker 1: We're going from the Dean of Graduate Studies to the Pro Vice Chancellor of our Global and Graduate Research.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.200
Speaker 1: Because Frank's restructured the port, we now need to be

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:29.800
Speaker 4: with a delegation.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.040
Speaker 1: Okay, and that those, so it's essentially a name change and a sub-delegation.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.780
Speaker 1: Are there any questions about Poseidon?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:38.980
No?

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:39.660
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:45.740
Speaker 1: I'm going to move that this be approved and I'm going to ask Julia Arnott-Neynay to second that.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.980
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.060
Speaker 1: And then we have no correspondence in Part A, but we have

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:52.920
matters

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.560
Speaker 1: for where the seal

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.440
has

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:08.000
Speaker 1: been affixed. We have a list of documents that the seal has been affixed to. I'm going to move that that list be noted and ask Julia Tomei to second that. Thank you very much.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.180
And

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:15.440
Speaker 1: now we'll move to the elections. We have elections to the Assemblyman Council. Welcome, Far.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.460
So

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.840
Speaker 1: I'm going to move.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:33.220
Speaker 1: that Mr Fa'afu'i'afia be appointed as the student representative on council for one year term from the 1st of November to the 31st of October 2025. And it's a year because this is the second half of Hullar's term.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.180
Okay, move

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.920
Speaker 1: that and ask John to second that.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:37.580
Speaker 3: Yeah.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:46.700
Speaker 1: Thank you. And then we just have there for noting, you'll see the meeting and graduation dates for 2025.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.900
Speaker 1: Is anybody looking for a leave of absence

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.080
for

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.160
Speaker 1: the first meeting next year, which is the 17th of March?

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:55.800
If

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:13.440
Speaker 1: you do, so Wendy is unwell at the moment. So if you do need to communicate, I would say, I'm not sure when she's coming back, Rewani, so maybe if somebody has, they should send a message. If they're emailing Wendy, they should copy you as well. Yeah, that's the thing to do. No, but note it is St. Patrick's Day.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.500
It

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:14.760
Speaker 1: is.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:28.740
Speaker 1: So I'll have to make sure I keep to time. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, yeah. Oh, we'll just have to make sure that there's a Guinness Street afterwards or something. Okay, and now,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.140
right,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.860
Speaker 1: okay, now I'm moving, actually I'm moving into part B with the public exclusions.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:39.940
Yes,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:47.160
Speaker 1: and I think I've already got, actually, I've got two resolutions here around the public exclusions and one having Matt stay twice.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.540
So

00:24:49.540 --> 00:25:17.080
Speaker 1: yes, I'm moving that due to the role of a pair of consulting them to provide independent advice to the council that Matt Stanley be permitted to retain in part B of meeting. And then I'm moving the public be excluded from part B other than Matt and the various members of staff that are saying because of their knowledge of the matters that are going to be discussed. I'm going to move that.
