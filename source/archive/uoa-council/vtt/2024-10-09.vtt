WEBVTT

00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.580
Speaker 1: So I won't repeat that. We have apologies

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.140
Speaker 1: from

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:16.660
Speaker 1: Ms. Anot Nene and Mr. McDonald. And we should all acknowledge we've just got the recording thing up. It's being recorded.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.120
Speaker 1: Okay,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:29.280
Speaker 1: so apologies have been received from Ms. Anot Nene and Mr. McDonald. And we thank Mr. Mason who has joined us despite being overseas. So thank you for that.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.420
Speaker 1: So I'm going to move that the apologies be noted and I will ask John to second that. That's okay, John.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.780
Speaker 1: Thank

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:59.160
Speaker 1: you. Now I withdraw the attention of members to the conflicts of interest policy and the need to disclose any interest in any item on the agenda of the meeting and is there anybody who wishes to make a disclosure? You know, this would include anyone who had children or family,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:10.020
Speaker 1: who were at the university and paying fees or who was taking a class themselves. I think anybody, that should be disclosed. Julia.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.800
Yes,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.840
Speaker 2: I have a daughter at the university who's paying fees. Okay, so we'll note that. Thank you very much.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:27.740
Speaker 1: As a student representative, I am a student, so I also pay fees. Yes, right. Hello. Candice, you're here twice.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:37.840
Speaker 1: Somehow I've got you twice. I don't know. It's all good. And I'm muted, Candice. One's muted, one's not.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.840
Speaker 1: You

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.140
Speaker 1: are muted now. We can't hear you.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.280
Speaker 1: But

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.260
Speaker 1: I think you're declaring a conflict of interest

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.620
Speaker 1: as

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.600
Speaker 1: a student. All right. Great. Thank you, Candice.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.360
Speaker 1: All

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.460
Speaker 1: right. Thank you, everybody, for that. All right. Now we're going to move.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:08.080
Speaker 1: be endorsed and I will ask I will why don't I sorry Frank you have your hand up

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.340
I

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.000
Speaker 3: was just gonna say I've got three children at the university paying fees

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.940
oh

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:23.980
Speaker 1: thank you Frank but I though I pretty well it's that's good to hear it's good to hear but it's you know it counts remember I don't need you that's there but that is really good to hear

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.280
Speaker 1: very

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.820
Speaker 1: good please

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.640
Speaker 1: yeah

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.340
Speaker 1: okay I will ask Gemma to

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:43.760
Speaker 1: I'm going to move those. Now I'm going to move to the minutes of the council from the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420
Speaker 1: 26th

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.260
Speaker 1: of August. Are there any questions or comments on those minutes?

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.380
Speaker 1: No

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.080
Speaker 1: questions or comments? Okay.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:26.380
Speaker 1: Then I'm going to move that those minutes be taken as read and confirmed. And I'm going to ask Dawn to... Oh no, it's not, it's just me. Thank you, Dawn. Okay. There's no matters arising that are not dealt with elsewhere. Okay. And now we'll move to the Vice-Chancellor's report and I'll invite Dawn to speak to that report.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.780
Speaker 1: Thank you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.560
Speaker 4: Chancellor. I'll do my usual thing of making sure that everybody's had a chance to read the report

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560
Speaker 4: but

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:45.760
Speaker 4: noting that as always there are things to supplement during the time from which it was submitted. I want to start today just by acknowledging

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.800
Speaker 4: the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:59.340
Speaker 4: achievements of our Blues Award winners and to thank the Chancellor for attending that award ceremony and to making those awards. It was a really substantial and significant

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.960
Speaker 4: for lots of reasons, but I just wanted to start with that piece of good news and congratulations.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.820
Speaker 4: I also wanted to note that today the embargo on the World University Rankings at the time's higher education

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820
Speaker 4: were

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.420
Speaker 4: released.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.079
Speaker 4: And I'm really pleased to say that the university has held its ground.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.100
Speaker 4: So in an increasingly competitive landscape where there's more than 300 additional

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.000
Speaker 4: universities being ranked, the university has managed to sustain 152 in that rankings from 150

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.160
Speaker 4: last year. And that's an increase actually in our percentile uplift in terms of those rankings,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.460
Speaker 4: given the extra number of universities that have been ranked.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.360
Speaker 4: I

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.299
Speaker 4: do want to say what's disappointing

00:04:50.320 --> 00:05:05.440
Speaker 4: is that this is not something that is generally reflected in the media. And you'll see that today, a number of articles which talk about the demise of the rankings in universities, New Zealand universities. And it's fair to say

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.360
Speaker 4: that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.880
Speaker 4: of the other seven universities, at least two of them have dropped again. And many of them are struggling to stay in the top 500. And that's been the case for a while.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.860
Speaker 4: I

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.280
Speaker 4: actually think we need to acknowledge that

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:27.820
Speaker 4: what we're achieving, given that the group of eight, seven of the group of eight have dropped, 50% of the UK Russell Group have dropped,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.640
Speaker 4: for

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.640
Speaker 4: us to maintain our position it's outstanding

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.800
Speaker 4: and

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.420
Speaker 4: given that we continue to remain number five

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.400
Speaker 4: in

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.860
Speaker 4: the QS sustainability rankings in the world, number 13

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.920
Speaker 4: in

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:49.180
Speaker 4: the Times Higher Education Impact rankings in the world and number 65 in the QS.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.220
Speaker 4: and continue to improve in other rankings such as the US World News.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.260
Speaker 4: I

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.560
Speaker 4: actually think that this is a really important message to get out to our community

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.660
Speaker 4: because

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:09.360
Speaker 4: this is the work of our staff and our community and our students achieving this. Really, it's an important piece of communication that we need to develop

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.260
Speaker 4: and

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.840
Speaker 4: to think about better. And I'm really looking forward to presenting the ranking strategy

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.960
Speaker 4: to

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.260
Speaker 4: the council in December, as we always do in December.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.120
Speaker 4: and

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.700
Speaker 4: I

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.020
Speaker 4: think you'll see not only where we're still maintaining and improving year on year

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.740
Speaker 4: our

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.160
Speaker 4: rankings but our strategy to continue that trajectory we know it's important

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.960
Speaker 4: for

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.840
Speaker 4: many many reasons.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.700
Speaker 4: I

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:44.640
Speaker 4: think the other thing I would point to is having just spent quite a bit of time traveling overseas with our ARD team

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.580
Speaker 4: and

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.280
Speaker 4: working through alumni events and meeting with some of our high

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.780
Speaker 4: and also

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.800
Speaker 4: having

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800
Speaker 4: the opportunity to talk to people following the UN Global Assembly in New York

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.000
Speaker 4: and

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.760
Speaker 4: a number of people in the UK meeting with our High Commissioner and others

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.020
Speaker 4: that

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:14.880
Speaker 4: clearly we are still viewed as a top performing university and really well regarded, had great conversations with our high profile donors.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.540
Speaker 4: But global sentiment at the moment

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.740
Speaker 4: is

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.140
Speaker 4: actually really challenging for universities.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.000
Speaker 4: And I picked this up with my peers in the Russell Group

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.900
Speaker 4: and

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:31.760
Speaker 4: across the group of eight and across the globe at the Times Higher meeting earlier this week,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:39.500
Speaker 4: where the future of universities and continued relevance and purpose was the topic of discussion and continues to be.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:46.680
Speaker 4: And so we're not alone in being challenged nationally around the global sentiment of the sector.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.260
Speaker 4: In

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:59.580
Speaker 4: that regard, a bit of an update on the reviews. So we had the opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister recently on this, particularly on the Science System Advisory Group review.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.640
Speaker 4: Now,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.880
Speaker 4: you'll have noticed that that was due to be reported into

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.140
Speaker 4: Parliament.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.580
Speaker 4: Actually, in September, it hasn't been reported.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.520
Speaker 4: There

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.620
Speaker 4: are, I think, some questions remaining around

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.660
Speaker 4: not

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:21.020
Speaker 4: simply the outcomes and recommendations of the report, but the resourcing of those and the significant change that will be required

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.340
Speaker 4: around

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:22.920
Speaker 4: the funding

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.080
Speaker 4: of

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.680
Speaker 4: the science system should some of those recommendations be adopted.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.080
Speaker 4: It

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.919
Speaker 4: looks like, and having spoken to Sir Peter Gluckman recently, it looks like the

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.860
Speaker 4: review

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.659
Speaker 4: of higher education funding

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:37.700
Speaker 4: and

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.599
Speaker 4: the scope of that

00:08:38.640 --> 00:09:07.360
Speaker 4: That expanded, as you know, to cover a range of issues, including the size, shape and overall composition of the whole sector, number of universities, governance, all of those things. That has slowed down. It was due to be reported in February, but that's looking like it's going to be, you know, unattainable at this stage because we've now got a second round of meetings with the advisory group,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.720
Speaker 4: They've already had one round of meetings with each of the universities

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.160
Speaker 4: and drafted a report but now want to talk further on one or two issues and that includes the

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:23.480
Speaker 4: funding models and the funding mechanisms. Those meetings won't take place before November,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.520
Speaker 4: December so it's highly unlikely that we'll see anything going through Parliament before

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:37.940
Speaker 4: middle of next year and I say that because of course we have extra funding that's been agreed until

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:43.900
Speaker 4: end of 2025 was really a temporary stopgap until the reviews were complete.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:57.260
Speaker 4: But we now know that it's going to be at least 26, 27 before we have any indications of outcomes of those reviews and implications for funding into those budgets in the future.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.480
Speaker 4: And so we remain in that uncertain position.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.540
Speaker 4: We know that where we are

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.940
Speaker 4: essentially

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.820
Speaker 4: until the end of 2025 from government funding point of view,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:46.500
Speaker 4: before Senate in the August meeting. I think I'll leave it there. Chancellor, I'm happy to take any questions or comments on the overall report.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.980
Thank

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:58.340
Speaker 1: you very much. Are there any questions for the Vice-Chancellor on the report?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:37.640
Speaker 1: The Blues Awards was a fabulous ceremony, absolutely magnificent. The people who organized it are to be really congratulated. It was also held in B201. As Adrian said, that's a great name we have for that building, B201, the new atrium, and it was an absolutely fabulous venue. And also as part of the Blues Awards, at the end of the Blues Awards,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.780
Speaker 1: We acknowledged Alan Shaker, who has been the AUSA president for the last two years. And

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.900
Speaker 1: there

00:11:44.900 --> 00:12:02.720
Speaker 1: was a haka done for him and it was a very special acknowledgement. So it was a great event and I was delighted to be there. And I got my picture with Teresa Setafano, you know, who's the rugby sevens player. So, Julia, you had a question

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.680
Speaker 1: and

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:03.900
Speaker 1: you're

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.120
Speaker 2: on mute. And then Cathy.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:21.740
Speaker 2: Just a really minor question for the Vice Chancellor about the report. I noticed we're developing a new engagement survey tool which enables us to take multiple Pulse surveys. And I just wanted to ask a question whether, so I'm assuming that's

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.060
Speaker 2: surveying

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:31.340
Speaker 2: staff, and whether we're considering building feedback loops back to staff in those engagement processes.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.760
Thanks,

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.200
Speaker 4: Julia. Just on the engagement surveys and the Pulse survey,

00:12:36.300 --> 00:13:06.140
Speaker 4: We already do have engagement feedback loops. And you'll be aware from some of the previous work that was done, at least across the faculties, that those feedback loops not only include providing opportunities for going, working our way through the results and the outcomes, both the narrative and the data with staff, but also taking feedback and then actually looking at recommendations and action plans going forward.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:06.840
Speaker 4: Now

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.740
Speaker 4: that's not just about across the academic staff that's across all staff

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.820
Speaker 4: and

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:19.460
Speaker 4: that will continue and in fact we've had feedback on the feedback loops that we also need to take into account Julia.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.540
Okay

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:24.960
Speaker 1: Kathy.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.200
Speaker 1: I

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.100
Speaker 1: just thought we should

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.620
probably

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:36.240
Speaker 3: record our thanks to Dawn and the whole of the academic and support team on achieving those

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.180
Speaker 3: Great results in the rankings. I thought it was just appropriate to acknowledge.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.920
Speaker 1: Absolutely. You know, that's very good. Thank you. Thank you, Cathy. I agree with that.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:51.480
Speaker 1: Yeah. And if you are happy to propose that and you'll second that, that's great. Thank you.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.860
Speaker 1: Absolutely. Because it is an enormous achievement.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.380
Speaker 1: And we need to get the word out.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.140
Speaker 1: All

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.640
Speaker 1: right, if there are no further questions, we'll move to the reports of council committees.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.960
Speaker 1: And

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.120
Speaker 1: the next item on the agenda is the Finance Committee.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.220
Speaker 1: Now,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.020
Speaker 1: that's the Finance Committee

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.160
Speaker 1: minutes

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:30.820
Speaker 1: from Part A. Are there any questions on that, on those minutes? Any questions, comments on those minutes?

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:32.860
Speaker 1: All

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.080
Speaker 1: right.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:57.180
Speaker 1: those minutes, I'll move that they be received and ask Carla to... Actually, I apologise. I haven't moved that the Vice Chancellor's report be noted and I'll have Kathy second that. Okay, right. Okay, then I'm moving to the Finance Committee minutes. There's been no comments, so I'm going to move that those be received and ask Carla to second.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.300
Speaker 1: Absolutely. And,

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.560
Speaker 1: okay, all right. Now we have the main...

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:14.200
Speaker 1: The item there relates to the domestic student fees and for 2025 and the international student fees for 2026.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.200
Speaker 1: There

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:23.080
Speaker 1: is a paper there. I will, Dawn, if you would like to, I don't know if you'd like to introduce this, otherwise we'll turn it over to Tim.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.400
Speaker 4: Happy to go to Tim in the interests of time, Chancellor. Thank you.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.820
Speaker 5: Tuna koutou. So thank you. Good afternoon.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:16:05.580
Speaker 5: I'll take the paper as read but I'll provide a summary of the different elements and then invite questions at the end if that suits the council. Obviously we start off by considering the overall backdrop and relevant context in which we're setting or proposing to set these fees and the considerations we've made, recognising that the economy remains tight in New Zealand, reflecting the

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:33.800
Speaker 5: the measures to bring inflation under control, noting today that the Reserve Bank has reduced the OCR by 50 basis points. Obviously, the financial sustainability considerations for ourselves as well as our peers are of great importance, noting also the uncertainty as we await the outcome from the two reviews that are currently underway for the sector.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:17:04.980
Speaker 5: Considerations for the alignment to our strategy, looking at the market and our sector as a whole, government policy, particularly a stance around public spending, and also considering the effects to students and their perspectives given the continuing cost of living pressures that we're all seeing. Also noting that in terms of the regulated fees for

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:33.680
Speaker 5: The paper is addressing the component of domestic fee that the students are responsible for paying. This is governed by the AMFM or the annual maximum fee movement that's set by government. Since we reviewed this with the Finance Committee a few weeks ago, this has been confirmed now as 6% the next year.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:45.800
Speaker 5: And that goes alongside the tuition subsidy, the DQ7, or what used to be called the SAC, which has been confirmed at 2.5% next year.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:59.720
Speaker 5: When we look at those two components of fees, the regulated elements, we note that those have not maintained parity with inflation.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:27.960
Speaker 5: And in particular, as we came out of that low inflation period leading up to COVID, there was quite a divergence that built from 2020 onwards. And that's outlined in the graph in the paper with basically an 11% gap now between inflation and the accumulated increases on these domestic regulated components.

00:18:36.399 --> 00:18:36.960
Yeah,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.760
Speaker 1: I mean, do you want to take

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.200
Speaker 1: questions

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.780
Speaker 1: as we deal with each part?

00:18:47.620 --> 00:19:00.060
Speaker 5: Yeah, we can do that. It may be easier for the council. I'll just finish with a little bit more in terms of domestic fees. Obviously, we've been doing a lot of work to maintain

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:30.060
Speaker 5: Maintain Quality for Students, which includes some elements of investment and support, hardship support as well as scholarships, focusing very much on student experience and noting also that during the COVID period we also took a softened approach if you like to certain aspects of that during that period. The paper also compares

00:19:31.240 --> 00:20:00.060
Speaker 5: the domestic fees against the New Zealand sector. It's a difficult one to do on an apples for apples basis, but generally we are fairly well aligned as a sector. And there's a specific example that the paper pulls out in terms of science fees, where you can see that six of the universities are clustered at a fairly similar level with two

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:28.440
Speaker 5: So the paper is recommending that we implement the full 6% maximum increase that has been approved as the AMFM for this year. And also applying the same increase to the regulated micro-recredential courses. So I'll pause there and invite any questions. Thank you.

00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:35.080
Are

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.620
Speaker 1: there any questions? I mean, Hala?

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:59.980
Speaker 6: I guess not much of a question, but more of sort of what we spoke about in Finance Committee since the minutes aren't here. But I think it was really helpful that in Finance Committee we did discuss a lot more about sort of the university's financial environment as well as just like what AMFM is and things like that so that we can understand where the 6% is coming from.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:09.740
Speaker 6: I think it's important to look at in past years when Massey didn't sort of increase it to the maximum of what AMFM was. They sort of struggled more financially. And so I think

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.460
Speaker 6: at

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:29.600
Speaker 6: face value, it doesn't look great that we're increasing it to 6% compared to what we have been increasing in past. But I think it's important to look at it sort of in the wider spectrum to understand why it's been increased the way that it has. And I think that's just important to give a little bit more context as to why it happened and sort of why I had shown my support in Finance Committee.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.020
Thank

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:40.680
Speaker 1: you. No, it's a very good point because obviously it is significantly more than it has been increased in the past, but it is very, as you say, reflective of the

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.840
Speaker 1: financial

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.180
Speaker 1: conditions that we find ourselves facing.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:46.740
Yeah,

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:59.620
Speaker 6: absolutely. And I think it's unfortunate with the cost of living crisis and everything that it has come down to this, but I think the messaging to students is really important about why we have increased it to this. And I think that's the only thing that I would definitely ask.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.800
Speaker 6: that we would be very transparent in our decision-making.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.740
Absolutely.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.340
Are

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.700
Speaker 1: there any other questions on this part of the paper?

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.700
Speaker 5: And I think actually probably

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:06.900
Speaker 1: really important to say not only not where we'd like them to be, but not where they are required to be by the TEC.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.040
In

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.940
Speaker 5: terms of maintaining the low risk rating, that's right. Yeah.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.700
Speaker 1: Maintaining our financial viability. And now moving

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:17.920
Speaker 5: on.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.480
Speaker 5: Yeah,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:26.240
Speaker 5: I think moving on now to the international markets. The proposal here.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:46.240
Speaker 5: Now this relates to the year after next. We always do this a year in advance. So the already agreed increase for 2025 is 4%. We are proposing a 5% increase to international fees for 2026 and a 4% study abroad increase.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:49.820
Speaker 5: In

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:56.640
Speaker 5: terms of maintaining real value, this has our

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:10.480
Speaker 5: A cumulative increase to the international fees over the same period that we refer to for domestic since the beginning of COVID has actually maintained parity with CPI.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.860
Speaker 5: We've

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:26.640
Speaker 5: also looked across the overall market both in terms of New Zealand and our positioning there and also importantly with the group of eight in Australia and we're looking to maintain positioning which is just higher

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:32.400
Speaker 5: than the New Zealand sector and just below the Group of Eight.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.020
Speaker 5: Also

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:52.440
Speaker 5: recognising that we have strategic objectives to balance diversification as well as we look to build our international cohort going forward, expanding on that, building on the reliance that we've had up until now, mainly on China.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:26.080
Speaker 5: Maintain a watch also on what's going on with the Australian situation and the impacts there that could be quite drastic depending what happens with the elections next year. But obviously there's a capacity issue, we're keeping a watch and brief on that and there could well be some flow and opportunity perhaps in terms of how New Zealand is perceived against that situation but also the similar trends that have been

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:45.080
Speaker 5: emerging in UK Canada as well. So those are generally the considerations and we feel that a 5% increase is an appropriate level to apply for 2026. So again, I'll pause for questions.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.460
Speaker 1: Yes,

00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:07.740
Speaker 6: sorry for another question. I guess when I'm looking at the readings, the main thing that it looks like we've looked at when considering that the increase is the world rankings and where we rank compared to other universities and how much they,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.940
Speaker 6: what

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:19.500
Speaker 6: their fees are. Do we sort of, we are just confirming that we do have like evidence that international students, that is what they value the most when they're choosing different universities.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:29.940
Speaker 6: because it's good to show that we are currently above the trend line. That means that our fees are lower than what we are ranking. But yeah, I just wanted to confirm that that is the main reason why international students would choose University

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:48.540
Speaker 5: of Auckland. That's certainly a factor. The table we were comparing rankings, the table itself was looking at the New Zealand universities and the group of ASE Australian just comparing their particular rankings against the average fees, not necessarily suggesting there's a correlation.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:58.260
Speaker 5: But in terms of the way students do look at this university and potential enrolments, you know, ranking is an important factor in that.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:26:59.360
Can

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:06.640
Speaker 4: I ask Frank to comment as well? Because what we know, Harla, is that international students will probably, first of all,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.340
Speaker 4: with

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.660
Speaker 4: their parents often think about which country, where they want to be.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.400
Speaker 4: There's lots of parameters around where

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.740
Speaker 4: and

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.400
Speaker 4: those decisions. And then once they get to that point, they're looking for the best university

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.360
Speaker 4: in

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:39.800
Speaker 4: that place geographically. And so if they're starting to think about Oceana, Australasia, they'll certainly look for the best universities in that region after they've decided that's where they want to be for a variety of reasons. Proximity to family, safety, a whole range of things.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:46.720
Speaker 4: experience. Frank, I don't know if you wanted to comment, but it is a very good question around the international student fee particularly.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.240
I

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.300
Speaker 5: agree, absolutely Dawn. I think we've got plenty of data to show that's exactly the way

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.060
Speaker 5: that

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.620
Speaker 5: students go about choosing where to go, international students.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.840
Perfect,

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:00.260
Speaker 1: thank you.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.020
Speaker 1: The next point is around the compulsory student services.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:14.960
Speaker 1: Well

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.280
Speaker 1: the micro-credentials, compulsory student services is the main point isn't it?

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:33.560
Speaker 5: With the international the English Language Academy is just part of that as well and you'll note that there's a range of increases on the different programs from between 2% up to 7%.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.860
Speaker 5: So

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.500
Speaker 5: I'll move on to the compulsory student services fee.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.540
Speaker 5: So

00:28:42.540 --> 00:29:09.880
Speaker 5: again, this requires us to go through a consultation process with the students, which has happened. There is a series of discussions and feedback meetings with the students' representatives during this process. And you'll note that there's been some feedback in terms of

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:30.900
Speaker 5: how they feel. The allocation of funding across the particular categories of spend are balanced and where they like to see less or more. We've consulted around a maximum increase of 4%.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.120
Speaker 5: We've

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:39.880
Speaker 5: completed that process. And also I'll just reference the appendix

00:29:39.900 --> 00:30:04.100
Speaker 5: where we look at the movements in cost against inflation, where we're showing an overall movement of 3.7%, noting that people costs would be around 4.4% as a key component of that cost movement that we're looking at next year.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:29.880
Speaker 5: So the 4% that we're proposing to increase is reflected of those cost drivers, but also the fact that it's proposed that the AUSA will take on some support for the growing demand for advocacy services that would be delivered as part of this suite of services covered by the fee.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:39.440
Speaker 5: And we've included in that allowance for the funding for them to be able to do that, which would otherwise be undertaken by the university.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.140
Speaker 5: So

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.760
Speaker 5: again, I'll pause there for questions.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.020
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they also Jim, a question.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:01.320
Speaker 7: Thank you, Tim. I just wanted to really reassure what I said by

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:09.940
Speaker 7: I appreciate that there has been consultation on the total amount that the fee would be increasing. I think that's a really great change that has occurred.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:11.900
Speaker 7: I

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.860
Speaker 7: also wanted to clarify in

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.920
Speaker 7: my

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:30.720
Speaker 7: day-to-day professional staff life, it's come to light, at least to me, that AUSA, their additional funds were consulted on with students. And I just wanted to clarify because the paper suggests that still needed to happen. That was a discussion we had. So if that's already happened, that's great.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.740
Speaker 7: But I just wanted to understand the status of that.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:41.700
Speaker 5: My understanding is that has happened. Okay. I can see other nods there. Yes, that has indeed happened.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:52.400
Speaker 7: Excellent. That's even better news. And then I guess my final question, this might be looking to the future a little bit, is that we do see trends over time in the levy and

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.780
Speaker 7: in

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:56.880
Speaker 7: terms of conflicts. I used to run the levy survey and we

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.540
Speaker 7: see

00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.380
Speaker 7: things around wanting an increased

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.320
Speaker 7: contribution

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:01.920
Speaker 7: to

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.380
Speaker 7: health,

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:09.780
Speaker 7: safety and wellbeing and things of that nature. What is our mechanism that we can slowly

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:10.760
Speaker 7: change

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.680
Speaker 7: our funding priorities or investment over time, acknowledging that that's not

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.120
Speaker 7: a

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.200
Speaker 7: fast change that can happen?

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.540
Yeah,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:31.320
Speaker 5: no, I think that's an important part of the consulting, consultative process and the way that Campus Life work with the student representatives. I think flagging up the

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:53.260
Speaker 5: the changes in views in terms of the weightings across this range of services. Obviously, it does take time to make adjustments to those. So I think that's the important part also, that we can then factor in those changing needs, if you like, or demands in terms of the planning that Campus Life do put together.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.200
Speaker 5: Thank

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.260
Speaker 1: you, Tim. That's good.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.080
Speaker 1: Okay.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:29.320
Speaker 1: So is there any more general questions about the fee increase? Obviously, this is a large increase for the students, but I think we all understand the rationale for it and the need for it. And also, I think that there, you know, I think it's really important, I think, and I think that AUSA and I think, you know, the students

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.640
Speaker 1: services and that sort of thing

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.360
Speaker 1: are

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:46.760
Speaker 1: aware of all this, that there is quite a lot of assistance available to students, like hardship grants and that sort of thing that, and, you know, we should just make sure, I mean, obviously we know that, I know it's something that the,

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.940
Speaker 1: that

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.900
Speaker 1: university makes sure that students are aware of. So, you know, as a council, we can be

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.380
Speaker 1: comfortable

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:59.020
Speaker 1: that there are some, there are some ways to assist students, you know,

00:33:59.100 --> 00:33:59.840
Speaker 1: in hardship.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:03.920
Speaker 6: Hala.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:09.460
Speaker 6: Just on that point, I was just wanting to sort of clarify that with these increased

00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:20.419
Speaker 6: fees, is there an increase in maybe the hardship funds or is the quantity of funds that we are able to give out to students increase or whether are they increased or are they the same?

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:52.320
Speaker 5: We do provide for funding for hardship and so does the there's other funds available to the TC and the Student Association. So we monitor that they're not always fully drawn and I'd also highlight the you know the scholarships and the the increasing value that we do allow for to support

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:59.440
Speaker 5: scholarships and various types of scholarship that students can apply for.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.060
Carla,

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.060
Speaker 4: I think the concern I have is that often our hardships funds are underspent.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.580
Speaker 4: So that, I mean, we can probably work more efficiently on

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.440
Speaker 4: making

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:22.020
Speaker 4: that information widely available, but we do work a lot through the various student communities to make sure that's known.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.840
Speaker 4: But yeah, there are funds there available.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:30.060
Speaker 4: Yeah, that's great. Just to provide a little bit more context. So thank you.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.680
Speaker 1: Great. Thank you.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:33.700
Speaker 1: All

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:47.760
Speaker 1: right. So we have a number of resolutions here. I'm going to take them all as one. Since this is an important step, I'm going to read out all of the resolutions, but I'm going to just put them all as one.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:36:18.600
Speaker 1: and I'm going to move them. Okay, so I'm going to move that one. Obviously, the report be received and noted in the one, council approved the attached domestic fees schedule for 2025. Two, approved the attached international fees schedule for 2026, including the English Language Academy fee schedule. Three, authorize the vice chancellor to assign any new programs, including government funded micro credentials or programs becoming newly available

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:45.480
Speaker 1: to an appropriate band to enable offers to be made during the recruitment cycle and report these decisions back to council. Four, approve the compulsory student services fee at $9.24 per point, GST inclusive, a 4% increase in the associated changes to the student fee schedule A. And five, approve the attached other fees scheduled for 2025.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:37:07.420
Speaker 1: resolutions and I'm going to ask Candice to second those for me. Thank you. And I'm going to ask everybody to show by a, you know, raise your hands to show that you are voting in favour of this resolution.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.200
Speaker 1: Have

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:18.020
Speaker 1: I got everybody? Yes, I believe I have everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Okay.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:24.680
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to move on to the Audit and Risk Committee to the minutes of Part A there

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.600
Speaker 1: and

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.340
Speaker 1: ask if anybody has any questions or comments around the Audit and Risk Minutes.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.600
Speaker 1: Okay,

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:46.660
Speaker 1: all right. If that's no comments, I'm going to move that the Audit and Risk Part A minutes be received and ask Jonathan to second that.

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:29.920
Speaker 2: Senate matters that doesn't comfortably fit in with the curriculum framework transformation. Is that something that I can raise here? Yes, but I would actually rather,

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:39.200
Speaker 1: I mean, I do appreciate that, and I see it is in 6.2, but I'll move them around when I get to them, but I prefer just to deal with the whole of Senate

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.160
Speaker 1: when

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:47.020
Speaker 1: we get to that. Okay, so then we have 8.1, we have the seal has been attached there,

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:52.640
Speaker 1: And if there are any questions around anything that the seal has been attached to.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.360
Speaker 1: No?

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:17.840
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, I will move that the attaching of the seal to the listed documents be noted and ask Gemma to second that. Thank you. And then now I'm going to leave 8.2 still and I'm going to move to the elections. I'm essentially moving the Senate matters to the end.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.060
Speaker 1: of the meeting.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.760
Speaker 1: So I'm now moving to the elections.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:27.020
Speaker 1: And I'm going to turn the chair over to Kathy Quinn.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.000
Speaker 1: Because it's around the appointment of the alumni representative on council.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.500
Speaker 1: And I'm going to mute my screen.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.840
Speaker 1: I'm going to mute and I'm going to go and check on my crock pot.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.500
Speaker 3: Okay, and I'll send you a text.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.900
Speaker 3: So we're now dealing with

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.540
Speaker 3: two

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:51.280
Speaker 3: things. One, to reappoint Cecilia Tarrant for a four-year term

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.480
Speaker 3: commencing

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.100
Speaker 3: on 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2020 to fill the position

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.600
Speaker 3: in

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:05.000
Speaker 3: relation to an alumni member of the university. And the second is to,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.120
Speaker 3: in

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.460
Speaker 3: relation to the appointment of

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:10.640
Speaker 3: Cecilia

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.920
Speaker 3: as the Chancellor for further

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.580
Speaker 3: One Year Term, I believe it is.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.220
Speaker 3: Is

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.040
Speaker 3: there any questions or comments

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:20.660
Speaker 2: on that?

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.500
Speaker 2: Yes,

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:21.840
Speaker 2: Julia.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.080
Speaker 2: I

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:32.040
Speaker 2: just have a question. I just went and looked at the Council Appointment Statute and it said the Council is to resolve to appoint one person being alumni of the University of Auckland

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.960
Speaker 2: following

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.820
Speaker 2: a call for expressions of interest from alumni. So I just wanted to check because I couldn't see in the papers that we've followed that process.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.200
I

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.920
Speaker 3: can't comment on whether or not there's been any

00:40:44.619 --> 00:40:47.900
Speaker 3: I'm sorry Julia. I'm not aware of any.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:48.740
Speaker 3: Do

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.400
Speaker 3: you know Dawn?

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:56.400
Speaker 4: Catherine can comment on this one. Yeah so that's in the first instance so when

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.420
Speaker 4: we

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.060
Speaker 4: would have appointed

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:13.920
Speaker 8: Cecilia in the first instance that would have been the case and I think we're able to extend Wendy aren't we in terms of the rules. I don't have them in front of me but I'm happy to

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:35.040
Speaker 8: I can confirm that for you, Julia, but that's my understanding. So if Cecilia's term was ending, then she wasn't able to be extended, then we would have to go out for another expression of interest. But at the moment, she is able to be extended for another term within the rules of

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.620
Speaker 8: Schedule

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.320
Speaker 8: 11 of the ETA. So normally,

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.580
Speaker 8: you're

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.920
Speaker 8: allowed

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.460
Speaker 8: So

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:56.620
Speaker 8: 12 years, I think, three terms, but because the Education and Training Act came in partway through Cecilia's term, she actually gets a little bit longer, which is also provided for in the ETA.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.240
Speaker 8: So

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:04.280
Speaker 8: we're not looking for a new member, we're looking for an extension of her term.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:13.740
Speaker 2: Gosh, I did read the council appointment statute and I read it as being that she could be re-elected.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.980
Speaker 2: or reappointed.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.120
Speaker 2: So

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:32.960
Speaker 2: it just says the council is to resolve to appoint one person being an alumnus of the University of Auckland following a call for expressions of interest from alumnus and then it goes on to say that you can have three periods of no more than, of four years, sorry.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.140
Speaker 2: Well

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.940
Speaker 2: I don't know we're going to resolve

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.240
Speaker 8: it

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:36.700
Speaker 8: here

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:43.920
Speaker 8: are we? But she's able to have a little bit longer than that Julia because of the change in the

00:42:44.580 --> 00:43:00.260
Speaker 8: which specifically provides for her if she was part way through a term that she can have another three terms so she's still within that clause sorry anyway I can draw the threads for you after the meeting.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:13.140
Speaker 3: So fair enough to raise it Julia it does sound like we're able to vote on this matter now on the basis that she's been extended compared to if we're looking for a brand new alumnus but

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:13.900
Speaker 3: I'm

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.440
Speaker 3: happy for you to take that offline with Adrian afterwards and if we have an issue we can

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.260
Speaker 3: discuss

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:19.580
Speaker 3: it.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.020
Speaker 3: So

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.180
Speaker 3: I was going to put that resolution, can I have a second?

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:30.980
Speaker 3: Oh

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:39.580
Speaker 3: thank you Candice, thank you Jonathan and can I have a show of hands for a vote of people in favour?

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:55.580
Speaker 3: It's very clear to me. Thank you. Can I also, as soon as we're doing it at the same time, deal with the appointment of Celia as Chancellor for another year? It's just a yearly appointment.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.440
Speaker 8: Again... I think I need to call

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.360
for

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.440
Speaker 3: nominations. Oh, okay. Sorry.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:12.180
Speaker 8: I'll call for nominations and can I assume that you will nominate? Yes, I will nominate Cecilia. Is there a seconder?

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.120
Speaker 8: Harla?

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.780
Speaker 8: Thank you. So there's only, are there any other nominations?

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.660
Speaker 9: No.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.740
Speaker 8: So as there's only one nomination, then I declare Cecilia to be elected as Chancellor. Excellent.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.060
Speaker 3: I'll text her to tell her to come back.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.480
Speaker 3: Wait

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:34.900
Speaker 3: one second.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:30.060
Speaker 3: I have texted Cecilia so hopefully she's on her way back. I'll hear you, Cecilia. Congratulations, you've been elected on both

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.960
Speaker 1: matters. Thank you very much.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.580
Speaker 3: I will depart while you deal with my position and you can text me.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:42.900
Speaker 1: Okay, great. Thank you. So we're now dealing with the election of the pro-chancellor.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:46:12.200
Speaker 1: for 2025. The person currently holding this position is Kathy Quinn. And once again, this is an election for the pro-chancellor, the deputy chancellor for a year. So I'm going to move. Kathy is still willing to be in this position. And so I'm going to move that.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.960
Speaker 1: that Cathy,

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.800
Speaker 1: I'm

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:34.300
Speaker 1: going to move her nomination for that position. And I'll seek a seconder for that nomination, please. Thank you very much, John. Okay, so John is seconding that. Thank you. Are there any other nominations for the position?

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.000
Speaker 1: Okay,

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.120
Speaker 1: with no other nominations for the position, I will declare

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:50.040
Speaker 1: Kathy elected and invite her to come back.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:58.740
Speaker 1: All

00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.060
Speaker 1: right.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.940
Speaker 1: Okay, good.

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:08.620
Speaker 1: So then with that, I'm now going to go back to

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.180
Speaker 1: the

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.220
Speaker 1: report of Senate.

00:47:13.099 --> 00:47:13.700
Speaker 1: in

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:29.940
Speaker 1: the Senate matters. Now, obviously, there is the curriculum framework. Congratulations, Cathy. You have been reelected as the pro-Chancellor. Great. There is the... I just want to interrupt and say thank you very much

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.340
Speaker 4: to both yourself and Cathy for being willing to stand again. Thank you.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:36.700
Wouldn't

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:41.760
Speaker 1: miss it, Dawn. And so, anyway, thank you.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.980
Speaker 1: So we've obviously got,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:49.340
Speaker 1: we have the curriculum framework transformation paper in 8.2.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.800
Speaker 1: We also have the report of Senate,

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.960
Speaker 1: the minutes from Senate of the 27th of August that deal with that same matter.

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.500
Speaker 1: And then there is the report of Senate from the 16th of September.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.040
Speaker 1: Now, Julia, you had mentioned,

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:09.780
Speaker 1: and there obviously are other matters on the 16th of September minutes.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:14.800
Speaker 1: So why don't we, if you think it would make it easier, why don't we deal with

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.760
Speaker 1: those

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:27.580
Speaker 1: matters in respect of the 16th of September now? And I don't know whether Dawn, there was anything you wanted to say about the 16th of September meeting

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.980
before?

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:39.980
Speaker 4: Well, we've got two separate things on the 16th of September. One does relate to the CFT that I wanted to speak to.

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:50.760
Speaker 4: which of course relates to the august meeting as well right so we'll deal with that and i was going to say let's separate those out i think they are

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.620
Speaker 4: all

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:59.980
Speaker 4: part of that same conversation but otherwise i think you've got the minutes of the 16th of september um we had

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.700
Speaker 4: um

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.100
Speaker 4: quite a long debate around the work that we've been doing on the

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:05.920
Speaker 4: uh

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.020
Speaker 4: free speech policy um council is very aware

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:40.020
Speaker 4: We've been working through a process over a number of years. In fact, prior to my appointment at the university on our stance on free speech. We did a lot of work on that through the working group that Sir Peter Hunter led. We also looked at that in the context of academic freedom. And we were then looking at it in the context of the broader statute and acts, as well as linking in with some of our

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:45.720
Speaker 4: other policies around HR and other areas where we have this

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.600
Speaker 4: in

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:52.160
Speaker 4: the collective. And so huge amount of work on behalf of the university community

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.420
Speaker 4: continues

00:49:53.420 --> 00:50:03.780
Speaker 4: to go on. There's been lots of debates about this as council has been updated. And of course, the landscape is changing externally as well, not just in New Zealand in response to

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.620
Speaker 4: thoughts

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.820
Speaker 4: around things like institutional neutrality. And again, that's been contested again recently.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:21.620
Speaker 4: but also a wide range of definitions on this particularly around the work of free speech academic freedom and where those two things sometimes get conflated

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.460
Speaker 4: so

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:24.200
Speaker 4: we haven't had a really good debate

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.520
Speaker 4: continues

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:33.760
Speaker 4: to be something that we're working on and we've taken away the feedback from senate we did go through a wide consultation

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.080
Speaker 4: on

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.740
Speaker 4: the policy and it was a policy that senate asked for

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:39.860
Speaker 4: And

00:50:39.860 --> 00:51:04.120
Speaker 4: so we do continue to work with Senate on that and the broader community, of course, because free speech is more a broad perspective than the academic freedom one, which simply refers to our academics and students. So that work will continue. We'll come back to council again once we've worked through the next steps on that. And I think that's enough to say on that.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:14.980
Speaker 4: And I'll leave the remainder of that report as read and we'll come back to the issues in relation to the CFT. Julia,

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.440
Speaker 2: was there something you wanted to raise?

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.020
Speaker 2: Yes,

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:22.360
Speaker 2: it wasn't actually about the academic freedom. It was about Andrew Jules

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.880
Speaker 2: asking

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.000
Speaker 2: for a notice of motion to be included in the agenda for the Senate meeting

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.020
Speaker 2: on

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.140
Speaker 2: ethical investment, which was not included.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:39.620
Speaker 2: because it was considered not to be an academic matter and therefore not within the purview of

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.420
Speaker 2: or

00:51:40.420 --> 00:52:04.160
Speaker 2: scope of Senate to consider. But what we've cited for that opinion is just one lawyer's opinion, so he hasn't given us a statutory definition or talked about any case law. And I think whether something is an academic matter is itself an academic question on which council should decide. And of course, would have to seek advice from Senate

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:34.000
Speaker 2: as to whether that's an academic matter. And I think there is an argument that it is an academic matter. Certainly the University of Canterbury thought it was. So I'm not expressing an opinion on whether it is. I'm just saying it's not an out there proposition. And there are other arguments as well. The ethical responsibilities of academic institutions, including our own responsibilities to serve our community and create globally,

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.040
Speaker 2: our values of manaakitanga and so on,

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:38.740
Speaker 2: our

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:49.800
Speaker 2: sustainability commitment, the educational impact that we can model basically aligning financial practices with our ethical values,

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.360
Speaker 2: and

00:52:51.360 --> 00:53:00.640
Speaker 2: of course our reputation and credibility, which for academic institutions is based on integrity and ethical behaviour, so that goes to our social licence to operate.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.680
Speaker 2: So

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.320
Speaker 2: it's really just a point that

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.160
Speaker 2: it

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:11.100
Speaker 2: It shouldn't be a decision for one lawyer. That's actually a decision. What an academic matter is, is a decision for Senate. So

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.000
Speaker 2: I

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.980
Speaker 2: would suggest that before Andrew Joel's motion goes to Senate, that

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:17.620
Speaker 2: the

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.920
Speaker 2: question goes to Senate as to whether that would be an academic matter.

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:22.380
So,

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:32.880
Speaker 4: Julie, thank you for that. Can I just be clear about what was decided at the Senate meeting? So our registrar, who is Adrian, of course,

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:40.460
Speaker 4: did make a communication on this around it not being a motion for Senate,

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:41.520
Speaker 4: but

00:53:41.520 --> 00:54:02.860
Speaker 4: we didn't say that we haven't done that work. And so that work has been done and we have actually responded to requests for information, both in the foundation and the university about those particular questions of investment and ethical investment. We just, it was actually that the motion wasn't a motion for Senate.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:22.500
Speaker 4: So I might just ask Adrian and Tim to comment on that because I think most people and I did raise this as an all staff zoom that work has been done and we have responded to those requests openly and responded to open letters so the so it's not that we haven't done that work that you've referred to

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.480
Speaker 4: it's

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.820
Speaker 4: that we didn't take the motion at Senate

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:26.900
Speaker 4: because

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:32.900
Speaker 4: it wasn't a place for that sort of motion but that doesn't mean the work hasn't been done and maybe Tim and I think that's a great question.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.480
Speaker 4: And Adrian might want to just comment on either of those two things, Judah, and thank you for that.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.560
So

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:43.820
Speaker 1: Tim or Adrian, who would like to start?

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.340
Speaker 1: Or

00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:51.160
Speaker 1: I can start if you like. I am aware that the first thing I would say, Julia, is that

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.940
Speaker 1: the

00:54:52.940 --> 00:55:02.860
Speaker 1: foundation is independent of the university. The university cannot direct, and as Andrew's motion quite rightly, you know, isn't asking us to direct.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.300
Speaker 1: the foundation to do anything.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:08.620
Speaker 1: I

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:17.920
Speaker 1: am aware though that the foundation has received letters asking for them, asking them to essentially identify

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.500
Speaker 1: whether

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.560
Speaker 1: they, you know,

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.800
Speaker 1: whether

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:32.880
Speaker 1: they have any financial products or companies that are involved with either A or B in that motion and that they have had, they are having that work done and are in the process of responding.

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.640
Speaker 1: to the letters that they have received. But Adrian and Tim, I don't know if you would like to comment.

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.040
Yeah,

00:55:39.100 --> 00:56:02.900
Speaker 5: I just echo the fact that the foundation is independent and subject to its own governance. I do know they have been working through responses to the letters. I don't think I can speak on their behalf and I know they've been working through this and continue to work on addressing the concerns

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:26.560
Speaker 5: and the follow-on letters that have been submitted. So really, I think I can't really say much more than that other than I do know from speaking to some of the trustees that they are obviously taking this very seriously and working diligently to respond to the letters as they come through.

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:27.660
I

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:31.420
Speaker 2: just say, I guess my point is not a point about the substantive things.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.200
Speaker 2: It's really a point about the process

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:35.620
Speaker 2: that, yes, you can't

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.620
Speaker 2: put Andrew, or maybe you don't

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:38.460
Speaker 2: want to put Andrew's

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.300
Speaker 2: motion

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:39.620
Speaker 2: to the

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:41.560
Speaker 2: Senate meeting, but whether or not it's an academic

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.080
Speaker 2: matter

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.560
Speaker 2: is

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:43.620
Speaker 2: a

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.680
Speaker 2: decision for Senate to advise Council

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.980
Speaker 2: on. Does that make sense?

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.540
Speaker 2: And if it advises

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:51.100
Speaker 2: Council on it being an

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.620
Speaker 2: academic matter, then Andrew would be

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.180
Speaker 2: able to put that motion, whether

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.680
Speaker 2: whatever one might think about the

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:58.540
Speaker 2: outcome of that.

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:28.640
Speaker 8: The advice I've received is that it's the Vice-Chancellor's decision whether or not to put a matter on the order paper and the Vice-Chancellor, if she decides not to, needs to put it as we have here on the next Council agenda. So for whatever reason, I think the Vice-Chancellor has that right. In terms of the statutory function,

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:42.540
Speaker 8: as well. The advice that I was given was that this was outside the statutory functions of Council and Senate. But that is the advice that I received from the General Council.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:46.760
I

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.780
Speaker 2: think that

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.580
Speaker 2: that's

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:52.700
Speaker 2: the General Council's opinion, but really it's for

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.600
Speaker 2: our

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.440
Speaker 2: Council to decide whether or not it's an academic matter, if that makes sense.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.160
Speaker 2: So

00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.840
Speaker 2: you're saying it's for the Senate to

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.940
Speaker 1: decide it's an academic matter? No, it's for the Senate

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:08.680
Speaker 2: to advise council on academic matters and whether something is an academic matter is a decision for council, essentially.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:09.780
I

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:19.320
Speaker 8: think the advice I received, Julia, though, went further than whether it was an academic matter or not. It goes to the point that it's outside the statutory functions. That's right. It's

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:23.720
Speaker 2: outside the statutory functions because it's not considered to be an academic matter.

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:26.680
Speaker 8: Not just because of that.

00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:30.240
Speaker 8: because actually it was about advice for

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.260
Speaker 4: an independent legal entity.

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.220
Speaker 4: The

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.220
Speaker 4: foundation's independent, Julia.

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.160
Speaker 4: Right.

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:47.420
Speaker 4: That's the advice. It's not just outside because of that. It's actually because of what Tim said. They're an independent legal entity. Right.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.420
But

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:56.480
Speaker 1: as I say, to give council some comfort in it.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:15.420
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the foundation are, as Tim said, you know, they are taking the matter seriously and are responding to the, you know, having their investment advisor do the work to find out what the answer is to the questions and

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.880
Speaker 1: taking

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:20.280
Speaker 1: it seriously. And in

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.160
Speaker 4: fact, even though it was,

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.380
Speaker 4: you

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:26.500
Speaker 4: know, outside the statutory requirements,

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:35.820
Speaker 4: I still felt it was important to put it to the council on the council agenda and for them to see that that was part of the discussion that was taking place Julia.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:37.880
By

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:45.640
Speaker 10: the way as the council rep on the foundation I'm happy to answer any questions about the foundation's position on these issues

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.720
Speaker 10: but

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:51.840
Speaker 10: that wasn't Julia's original question. No no that's right and I

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:56.520
Speaker 1: don't think and I don't think that's appropriate necessarily it can

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.520
Speaker 1: Council, I think. Mine was really a question about process.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:01.280
Speaker 4: Yeah.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:03.780
Speaker 4: Hopefully

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:07.820
Speaker 4: that's clarified, Julia, given the nature of the foundation.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.420
Okay.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:21.580
Speaker 1: Are there any other questions other than relating to the curriculum framework transformation with respect to the minutes of the 16th of September?

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.020
Speaker 1: in

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.320
Speaker 1: terms of the,

01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.900
Speaker 1: we

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.520
Speaker 1: have the,

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.340
Speaker 1: everything that we were asked to note,

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.000
Speaker 1: a resolution that we note,

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.120
Speaker 1: and that,

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.780
Speaker 1: and we have the various papers.

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.140
Speaker 1: We also have in 8.2,

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.100
Speaker 1: a,

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.320
Speaker 1: a paper taking us through the various matters around,

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:19.240
Speaker 1: you know,

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.940
Speaker 1: the curriculum framework transformation,

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:22.520
Speaker 1: all of which,

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:22.760
Speaker 1: you know,

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840
Speaker 1: some of which we've been at,

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.340
Speaker 1: we've had the opportunity to have a good discussion about,

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.560
Speaker 1: in the briefing. So I think the question,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.280
Speaker 1: I

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:42.500
Speaker 1: think there are two questions now. Dealing first, are there further matters that people would like to raise and discuss

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.880
Speaker 1: around

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.900
Speaker 1: this? I mean, essentially, if I could just summarize the discussion that we had,

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.600
Speaker 1: the

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.420
Speaker 1: discussion we had in the briefing was that there was concern expressed

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:01.080
Speaker 1: on the 27th of August at the special meeting around the

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.280
Speaker 1: course

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:26.420
Speaker 1: optimization process that was being run out of the PDDC. And as Julia has pointed out, there was general concern about some of the processes that have been taking place around the curriculum framework transformation. But subsequent to that meeting, the decision was made to halt the process that was being run

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:56.420
Speaker 1: through the PDDC office. And that's reflected in the minutes of the 16th of September, where it is acknowledged that that process was being done, and that the speed of the process and communications around it were poor and inconsistent, and that this raised concern with staff and students. And what we're being told is that

01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:02.920
Speaker 1: has now, that works not, it's not going through the PDDC, it's now

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:03.560
Speaker 1: all

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.180
Speaker 1: of that's going through the normal faculty processes

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.160
Speaker 1: and

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:12.760
Speaker 1: the deans of the faculties at that second meeting confirmed the work was taking place within the faculties.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.200
Speaker 1: So

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:26.420
Speaker 1: the, but as we discussed in the briefing, this is still a process I think that it is important that it takes place and I think everybody needs to be, I mean, we need to be making

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:32.520
Speaker 1: making sure that what we're offering are relevant that you know relevant for

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.280
Speaker 1: the

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.720
Speaker 1: the people that we're

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.560
Speaker 1: the

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.960
Speaker 1: students that we're educating

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.800
Speaker 1: we

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:52.400
Speaker 1: also you know in the in the paper in 8.2 there is discussion about the Waipapa Te Amatero courses and the transdisciplinary courses and we had a good discussion

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.920
Speaker 1: of

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.420
Speaker 1: those courses understanding really

01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:01.500
Speaker 1: the content, how they were being delivered and what was going on with those courses

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.340
Speaker 1: and

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.420
Speaker 1: understand that with the Waipapa Tau Maturau course,

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.140
Speaker 1: there

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:21.920
Speaker 1: is a single course being piloted at the moment. It's going to be reviewed at the end of that course. And the intention is that there will be the Waipapa Tau Maturau courses. There will be one in every faculty

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.900
Speaker 1: except

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.360
Speaker 1: for the law faculty, I believe, where,

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.880
Speaker 1: you know most people will be doing

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.820
Speaker 1: or

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:36.640
Speaker 1: the people I guess coming into intermediate or into conjoint would do the course in there in the faculty they come in through

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.720
Speaker 1: and

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:43.940
Speaker 1: then with respect to the TD course the transdisciplinary course there are two being piloted at the moment

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:44.640
Speaker 1: there

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:54.040
Speaker 1: will be six being piloted next year and then once again there will be reviews of those done before they go into the curriculum in 2026.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.160
Speaker 1: So

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.520
Speaker 1: I think that is a summary of the discussion that we had

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.460
Speaker 1: around

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:04.800
Speaker 1: those courses. And are there, so I'm looking for, are there any

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.160
Speaker 1: other

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:13.420
Speaker 1: questions or discussion that people wish to have around those matters?

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:15.920
Speaker 1: Any

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.740
Speaker 1: points that they'd like to make and make sure that are made in this part of the meeting?

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:25.420
Yeah,

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:44.100
Speaker 6: I guess something that we didn't quite discuss was the, there's obviously the pilots are happening now for Waipa-Pato-Motaro as well as the Transdisciplinary Course. Has there been any sort of positive feedback from the students? What have we been hearing from students who are actually undertaking this course? Do we have any of that data yet?

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.880
Speaker 1: Bridget, is that something that you can

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.540
Speaker 1: ask,

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.640
Speaker 1: Dawn or Bridget?

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.120
Yes,

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.480
Speaker 11: so sorry, from the Waipa-Pato-Motaro courses,

01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:24.640
Speaker 11: We have had a couple of evaluations along the way and it's quite a structured process of how that information is going to get it. So, so far positive. The TV, the two TV pilots have also had an initial feedback, which has been quite interesting. Landing positive, the interesting thing is there's some stage three students doing it because you can do it as part of a general department. And the teaching staff feel that it was interesting that the stage three students have already kind of

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:31.540
Speaker 11: quite sort of fixed in their disciplinary way of thinking. So that was interesting. I think also some reflections on

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.400
Speaker 11: assessment

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:54.640
Speaker 11: activities. So, so far, actually the one of them has had a 90% attendance rate within the seminars, which was unheard of. The lecture attendance rate is about 40%, it's still farther than what we'd see ordinarily. So that's really encouraging. So they're thinking about what they can do with that and the wide

01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:03.200
Speaker 11: getting such good attendance within that's a lot of good people. So definitely some good feedback, some good things to reflect on and also to carry forward.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:11.260
Julia? Sorry,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.600
Speaker 2: you alluded to this before, Cecilia, but I did want to put on the public record

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.420
Speaker 2: that

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:24.280
Speaker 2: I had made the point that we have some very well-developed top-down processes for strategies, developing strategies like this in this institution.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.580
Speaker 2: but don't have the same robust ground-up processes,

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.220
Speaker 2: which

01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:38.500
Speaker 2: means that we may not have the robust consultation processes that we think we've built into something when we consult with faculty heads or associate deans,

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.000
Speaker 2: and

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:50.460
Speaker 2: that to acknowledge that the way that the CFT has come through Senate has been challenging for some academics, and that it's come in pieces, sometimes hasn't been well signposted,

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.360
Speaker 2: and

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.500
Speaker 2: the full potential effects of the implementation on other courses,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:02.840
Speaker 2: didn't really come into focus till the end of the process. So that has left some people feeling as though they haven't had the input that they would have liked

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.900
Speaker 2: into

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:04.900
Speaker 2: the CFT process.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:09.540
Jonathan,

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:24.640
Speaker 1: okay, yeah. And I think it's important for us to remember that the CFT process, and we talked about course optimization, we talked about the Waipapa Tau Matarau and also the TD courses, but we

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:38.259
Speaker 1: We didn't talk in the briefing about the other elements of the curriculum framework transformation, which obviously include the graduate profile

01:08:38.259 --> 01:08:39.060
Speaker 1: and

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.339
Speaker 1: also include the,

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.839
Speaker 1: I

01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:53.460
Speaker 1: apologize, I'm having trouble reaching. Relational learning. Also the flexi, the flexi, what was that? The flexi.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.859
Speaker 1: The flexi-choice thing. Apologies for calling it the flexi-choice thing.

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.640
Speaker 1: Yeah,

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:19.000
Speaker 1: flexi-choice. Flexi-choice. That was one part that we had not discussed in terms of flexi-choice and the expanded learnings. Bridget?

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:49.620
Speaker 11: Just in response to Julia's acknowledgement of that, we have had a grassroots approach in that. We've had huge teams working on this across the university and I think perhaps one of the most transformative parts about this whole process is that we have engaged and faculty has acknowledged that not everybody may have felt like they did that, but we have had faculty workshops, we've had specialist working groups, we had 80 people involved from across the university.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:10:19.640
Speaker 11: So there have been lots of hundreds of staff have attended workshops. To your point, reflexi-choice, so that is something that we're still refining some thinking around that. Also the expanded learning. So they are pieces that still will have some decisions to be made and they will go through our processes, take on board the signaling. So thank you for that, Julia. So we're going to think about ways that we can

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:42.600
Speaker 11: I think that signposting might hopefully help and I know when there's pages and pages of me at Senate, I do try and draw things to our Senate's attention but I'll certainly make sure that it's more explicitly when it's in relation to CFT. So hopefully that will assist.

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.420
Speaker 7: Gemma.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:56.280
Speaker 7: I wanted to reiterate Julia's point about the process being poor and acknowledge

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:04.400
Speaker 7: management's response that it was a poor process and that changes have been made since that time to

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.480
Speaker 7: take

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.020
Speaker 7: a different path and I also

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:07.880
Speaker 7: wanted

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:19.640
Speaker 7: to have in part a my support of CFT more widely we have come so far over the last three years and I really appreciate all the collaboration of academic and professional staff

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:41.740
Speaker 7: who have gone into making all the taumata happen. And as you said, Cecilia, there is many different parts to this framework. And it's really exciting that we're coming to this point of fruition and disappointing that we've had a sidetrack. But also it's a good opportunity for those who might not have been up with the play to come into the conversation too. Thank you.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:44.220
Speaker 7: All

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:44.620
Speaker 7: right, Hala.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:46.580
Yeah,

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.620
Speaker 6: I also, similarly to Gemma, I would just want to acknowledge

01:11:49.640 --> 01:12:18.000
Speaker 6: sort of CFT, even in the Senate meeting, the students did really vouch for CFT just because of the students' engagement throughout the process. They have like a regular slot in the student council meeting, student consultative group as well. I think that there's been a lot of consultation with students and the fact that their pilot sessions are constantly being evaluated, I think is a very good reflection. And probably we're evaluating these courses more than we do our regular courses, which I think is a great stepping stone. So yeah, I just wanted to sort of say that publicly too.

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:35.300
Speaker 10: Cecilia, I just had a clarifying question. Is the new pilots limited to undergraduate or is it contemplated that that would also eventually include masters and PhD students?

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:49.440
Speaker 11: That's a really good question. I'm happy to answer that, Cecilia. So what we're looking at is so in respect to the Y Papa Tanaka Rho courses, is that your question, Jonathan?

01:12:49.640 --> 01:13:19.560
Speaker 11: So we are looking at and the plans to develop some sort of module that could be used for so for doctoral students building on those those tomata also that could be used for staff coming to the university from outside New Zealand who it all might seem a little bit of a mystery and also to think about how postgraduate students what will be in a and not in the same way but they have access to that material to use because it's been so beautifully done and it's had so considered in the way it's been developed.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.960
Speaker 11: So

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.480
Speaker 10: TBD is what I'm hearing to be determined, but

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.660
Speaker 10: certainly under consideration.

01:13:29.170 --> 01:13:31.620
Speaker 10: Yeah. Thank you.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:47.400
Speaker 1: Okay. So, so what we have here is we have in front of us a motion where Senate is asking that we have,

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:46.840
Speaker 1: As Julia said, you know, there has been some confusion and some concern about other elements. And but then we have the report of Senate of the 16th of September, where we have the various, you know, various components. We have the effectively the answer with management responding to the concern raised by Senate on the 26th of August saying, OK, we've gone back to the normal faculty process.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:15:16.880
Speaker 1: So, you know, that we've halted, you know, running that, you know, being, you know, generating that process, if you like. And then we have the discussion and we have the, you know, the Senate recommending to council that it receive and note the papers regarding the curriculum transformation. And those papers relate to, you know, the program overview and how it's going to operate,

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:21.480
Speaker 1: the pilot courses are going to be reviewed

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:28.400
Speaker 1: and talks about in more detail about the transdisciplinary paper as well.

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:41.680
Speaker 1: So what I would intend to do is to, first of all, with everybody understanding that history,

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.140
Speaker 1: I would be moving

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.340
Speaker 1: to

01:15:46.340 --> 01:16:06.900
Speaker 1: my, what I would be moving is to say that the implementation of the curriculum framework transformation not be paused, but I think that as part of the resolution that we pass, we should note the concerns that have been raised and we should note the management response, particularly around the

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.840
Speaker 1: course

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.120
Speaker 1: optimization process.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.480
Speaker 1: And then we should note

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.120
Speaker 1: that

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.640
Speaker 1: other concerns have been raised. And also, I think that one of the things that we can do

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.300
Speaker 1: to

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:25.460
Speaker 1: give ourselves future comfort is that we can, and it does, there is part of this already in the

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:28.500
Speaker 1: resolution

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.700
Speaker 1: that's in the Curriculum Framework Transformation paper.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:32.680
Speaker 1: It

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:39.380
Speaker 1: talks about the further advice, things coming to the March 2020.

01:16:40.179 --> 01:17:02.740
Speaker 1: meeting, but I think we can perhaps put more detail around that and ask not only that, you know, that these, that the, around the, particularly around the elements, I think we can specifically say we want to get a report on the review of the Waipapa Taumata Road course that's been piloted this year.

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:03.680
Speaker 1: Then

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:09.000
Speaker 1: I think we can ask that we get a report on the review of the transdisciplinary courses.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:20.260
Speaker 1: Now, I don't know whether that's taking place this year or next year, and then we can ask that there be a review be done

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:21.080
Speaker 1: at

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:33.520
Speaker 1: the end of 2025 of all of the courses, the Waipapa Tau Maturau and the TD courses that have been presented, and ask that for a report on that to come back to council.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.300
Speaker 1: So that's

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.240
Speaker 1: my suggestion as to how we handle this. Now, Julia.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.340
I

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:59.380
Speaker 2: just wanted a couple of points of clarification. So just to confirm, we have stopped our urgent course optimisation process. That's just gone back into the normal thing. But the second question is, on my reading of the papers, we're bringing the transdisciplinary courses back through Senate before?

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:01.500
Speaker 2: Is

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.420
Speaker 2: that correct?

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:03.580
The

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:08.640
Speaker 11: regulations. Yeah. So we haven't, the regulations are under the balance.

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:13.420
Speaker 11: They haven't been

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:14.720
Speaker 4: through Senate yet, Julia.

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.480
Okay.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.460
Speaker 1: Cecilia, I'm happy to second your motion.

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.400
Speaker 1: So

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:28.400
Speaker 1: that's the motion I'm proposing to put. And is there any commentary on that motion?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.320
Just

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.780
Speaker 8: to clarify, Chancellor, so you're not putting the motion on the order paper? You're wanting to change that?

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:52.020
Speaker 1: Yes, that's correct. I am changing the motion on the order. Well, to be fair, the motion related to 27.8 says to be determined following council discussion.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.380
Speaker 8: 8.2, we've got the motion. Oh, yes,

01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:08.480
Speaker 1: 8.2, yes. I guess I'm going to put 8.2. I guess I'm expanding 8.2, if you like, and I apologise.

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:09.960
Speaker 1: I lost my page.

01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:18.440
Speaker 8: Yeah. Maybe we could we go through 8.2 until and just so we down which ones are wanting to change. Yes exactly.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:33.420
Speaker 1: Yeah absolutely. So so I so what I'm proposing to to do right is I am proposing to start by and I'm

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.780
Speaker 1: may

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:37.380
Speaker 1: we put we'll put 6.1 and 8.2 together.

01:19:37.620 --> 01:20:07.580
Speaker 1: What I'm proposing to do is start by noting the motion passed by Senate at their meeting of August 27th. Noting that the curriculum framework transformation has been discussed with Council in the briefings. Noting that as confirmed at the Senate meeting on September the 16th, the course optimization process

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:14.740
Speaker 1: As you described it, Julia, the urgent course optimisation process run by the PDDC has been stopped

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.960
Speaker 1: and

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:36.020
Speaker 1: the decisions about courses and programmes are now continuing through the normal faculty process. Acknowledge the concerns raised by Senate and encourage management to continue to engage

01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.480
Speaker 1: with

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:37.580
Speaker 1: all

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.160
Speaker 1: areas of the university on the CFT.

01:20:46.719 --> 01:21:05.700
Speaker 1: I would, in addition, I would consider, this is up to people whether they want this or not, noting however that it is important that the courses and programs at the university be reviewed regularly to maintain a contemporary suite of offerings for students

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.080
Speaker 1: and

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:15.460
Speaker 1: to ensure coherence and relevance of the qualifications being offered by the university and to ensure the continued financial viability of the university.

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.420
Speaker 1: And

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:35.000
Speaker 1: then I would be requesting that the council receive at its March 2025 meeting a report on the reviews of the pilot WTR and TD courses around this semester.

01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:47.060
Speaker 1: Request that a review be conducted on the WTR courses at the end of 2025 and a report on that review be presented to Council at its March 2026 meeting.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.240
Speaker 1: And

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:59.540
Speaker 1: then on that basis resolve that following the discussion the implementation of the CFT should continue

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.460
Speaker 1: in

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:05.400
Speaker 1: the manner set out in the paper presented to Council on the CFT at Item 8.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:53.000
Speaker 1: on that resolution. Is there any concern from management that we are asking for reports? Is that going to, I don't like to put an additional burden, but I would have expected that what we're asking for is reports of reviews that I'm expecting are already taking place.

01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:53.800
No,

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.500
Speaker 4: I think it's important that we document that request, Cecilia.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:22:59.760
Speaker 4: Just

01:22:59.760 --> 01:22:59.940
Speaker 4: to

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:00.760
Speaker 9: say yes, I agree.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.400
Okay,

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:05.680
Speaker 1: and Bridget's nodding because I think she's running the

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.060
Speaker 1: Okay,

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:16.460
Speaker 1: so could I have a show of hands to show if people are in favor of that resolution?

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:23.240
Speaker 1: Okay,

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:29.700
Speaker 1: that's passed. Thank you very much. Okay, now I'll move to the resolutions that are in 8.2.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:31.800
Speaker 1: And

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.680
Speaker 1: this is moving that we note that the CFT

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:55.020
Speaker 1: program is a framework comprising a number of elements. Note that Senate and Council have already endorsed policies and regulations relating to elements of CFT including the Graduate Profile, the Waipapa Tau Matarau course and program regulations which are now in effect for the 2025 academic year.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:56.760
Speaker 1: Note

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:05.680
Speaker 1: that other elements of the CFT are yet to be finalized and considered by Senate and Council including the Transdisciplinary Course Regulation

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:12.940
Speaker 1: and there's a dot dot dot there but it's just the regulations

01:24:16.139 --> 01:24:22.520
Speaker 1: and approved continuation of work for the approved CFT elements coming into effect in 2025

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:30.620
Speaker 1: and request that management and senate and the faculty subcommittees to provide further advice on the direction and benefits of the CFT program

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.140
Speaker 1: at its March 2025 meeting

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:33.820
Speaker 1: through

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:46.760
Speaker 1: the normal channels and that whilst preparatory work will need to continue in the meantime, such advice is to be received prior to further policy and regulatory decisions being made. So Valerie, you had a quick, yeah?

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.440
Speaker 1: I

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:47.940
Speaker 1: just have a,

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.900
Speaker 9: it's a very tiny detail. I just want to point out that

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.860
Speaker 9: just

01:24:51.860 --> 01:25:00.520
Speaker 9: because I was tracking them both as you read them out, as written in the agenda, what you read out is broadly similar but not exactly.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.100
Speaker 9: the same wording is at the top of the 8.2 paper.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:06.920
Speaker 9: Oh,

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:07.400
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:11.420
Speaker 1: What I read out was on the agenda and I should have been reading out what was on the paper.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.040
Speaker 1: Yes.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.980
Speaker 9: So I'm just saying is that the two are not somewhere on the way.

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:20.720
Speaker 9: The wording is not quite the same, but they're broadly similar.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.020
Speaker 1: Right.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:22.280
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:25.060
Speaker 1: Let me go back to the paper.

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:25.460
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:29.100
Speaker 1: So we've got, so where does it differ?

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:29.780
Speaker 1: Help me.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.360
Speaker 9: The paper does not, so on the agenda there's a bullet point that starts with approves

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.340
Speaker 9: and

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:50.480
Speaker 9: that is not in the. Oh right, yeah, yeah, no, no. But instead there's a note that implementation will continue. Yeah, yeah. So it changes it from an approves to a notes essentially. Right. I just don't want this to be a thing afterwards when people go ahead. Yeah, yeah,

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:56.960
Speaker 1: no, no, no, that's a good point. Okay, so essentially what we're looking at is what's on page 76 of diligent,

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.980
Speaker 1: not

01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:59.760
Speaker 1: what's in the agenda.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:05.500
Speaker 1: But

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.120
Speaker 1: I think I would

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.040
Speaker 1: I would want to change

01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:12.700
Speaker 1: I mean obviously I've made

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.920
Speaker 1: that second note

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.200
Speaker 1: I would alter

01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:17.680
Speaker 1: I would alter slightly

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:20.800
Speaker 1: in the way I'd altered it on the first one

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:23.500
Speaker 1: Happy

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.600
Speaker 1: to support your motion

01:26:26.739 --> 01:26:27.260
Speaker 1: Okay

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:28.900
Speaker 1: so this is the second motion

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:00.740
Speaker 1: Thank

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:09.300
Speaker 1: you very much everybody. I appreciate that and I appreciate that it has taken some time to get through the meeting.

01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:10.200
Speaker 1: Okay,

01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:28.260
Speaker 1: now we're, and also I thank management for all the work that is going into this and I also thank particularly our academic and professional and student reps for their feedback to the council because I think that's really important.

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:40.500
Speaker 1: and good feedback for management to get as well. So thank you for expressing that. So now we're at, does anybody have any general business for part A of the meeting?

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.420
Speaker 1: No?

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.300
Speaker 1: Okay. Then we'll go to, does anybody require a leave of absence for the 9th of December?

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:49.580
Speaker 2: Julia?

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.040
Speaker 2: Yes,

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.620
Speaker 2: I won't be in town for the 9th of December. Okay. Okay.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:57.880
Speaker 2: Okay.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:58.860
Speaker 2: Anybody else?

01:27:59.699 --> 01:28:06.760
Speaker 1: And Wendy, you'll be able to check with Julia, Anot Nene and Rob McDonough.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:07.760
Speaker 1: Okay.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.800
Speaker 1: All right. Thank you very much. I am going to then move

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.580
Speaker 1: that

01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:28.700
Speaker 1: the public be excluded from Part B of this meeting, given the subject matter to be considered and the need for confidentiality for certain of these matters for the operation of the university. And more specifically,

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:58.680
Speaker 1: the resolution that is set out there in the agenda. And that Adrian Clannan, Professors Linton and Bloomfield, Andrew Phipps, Tim Blewett, Pamela Moss, Helen Katanach, Anthony Brandom and Wendy Vesherin and I would think Andrew Rose and need to, no we don't need media, okay Andrew, do I need media? And media productions be allowed to remain for part B of the meeting to the extent that they wish to.

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:07.780
Speaker 1: are required to do so. And I'm going to move that. And could I ask, could I ask Carla to second that, please?

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:09.500
Speaker 1: Thank

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:19.560
Speaker 1: you very much. We stay on this link, Cecilia, but the live stream's finished. Yes, so we're now, we're now waiting for the live stream to close. Is that right, Wendy? Or we can ask,

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.760
Anthony,
