WEBVTT

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.540
Speaker 1: All of our Council members are here. Are there any disclosures of interest by any members?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.760
Speaker 1: I'll

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:29.980
Speaker 1: take that as a no and we will record that. So we will move to item 3 which is the confirmative degrees and you will have noted for obvious reasons it's a slightly longer list. It's by the authority vested in me by resolution of the University of Auckland Council, I Scott St John

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.600
Speaker 1: and conferred the degree stated upon those who within their several faculties have satisfied the requirements of this university.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.940
Speaker 1: And

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:58.120
Speaker 1: we will move similarly to the award of diplomas. By the authority vested in me by resolution of the University of Auckland Council, I, Scott St John Chancellor, award the diplomas stated to those who within their several faculties have satisfied the requirements of this university.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:20.680
Speaker 1: So that done, we will deal with the Minutes Part A from the meeting of 16 March, which seems like an eternity ago, but we're all sitting face to face. Then, has anyone got any comments on those Minutes?

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.060
Speaker 1: So

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.800
Speaker 1: we will take them as a fair and accurate view.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.840
Speaker 1: I will move. Can someone second please?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.560
I'm

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.500
Speaker 2: happy to Scott, Cathy.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.360
Thanks,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:56.580
Speaker 1: Cathy. All those in favour, say aye. Aye. Aye. Against. Carried. So we will now move to the Vice-Chancellor's report. Dawn, we welcome you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.380
Speaker 3: Thank you Chancellor and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.480
Speaker 3: hello

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.940
Speaker 3: to everyone

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.760
Speaker 3: who

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.000
Speaker 3: is not visible on the screen.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.460
Speaker 3: What

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.980
Speaker 3: I'd like to do is I'll just talk through some of the highlights in the report and I may also ask Adrian to comment

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.920
Speaker 3: on

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.920
Speaker 3: one or two of the items that are contained. It's quite a lengthy report so I'm taking it as read.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.700
Speaker 3: I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.980
Speaker 3: want to start by acknowledging the outstanding achievement that was announced

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.020
Speaker 3: last week for the university to remain and retain

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.040
Speaker 3: its

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.220
Speaker 3: number one slot

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.080
Speaker 3: as

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.680
Speaker 3: the university leading on the sustainable development goals

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.300
Speaker 3: through

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.000
Speaker 3: the times higher education rankings. It's a significant achievement to retain that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.080
Speaker 3: ranking,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:59.980
Speaker 3: not least because of the increase in numbers of universities that submitted in a whole range of areas. So I want to start by acknowledging that and congratulating all of the staff that have been involved in

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.320
Speaker 3: that achievement to date and of course we retain it for a year

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.000
Speaker 3: so

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080
Speaker 3: please feel free to talk about it and to continue to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.200
Speaker 3: get

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.440
Speaker 3: behind that achievement wherever you can in whatever forum you can.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.540
Speaker 3: The

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
Speaker 3: other thing I'd just like to acknowledge in this report is that you'll see that we've been able to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.860
Speaker 3: quite

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.820
Speaker 3: extensively include the work of the PVC

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.940
Speaker 3: Pacific so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.460
Speaker 3: Damon has now started to infuse

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.440
Speaker 3: the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.980
Speaker 3: work of this strategy throughout

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.260
Speaker 3: number of the KPIs and we're seeing those throughout the report and I'll refer to some of those

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.020
Speaker 3: as

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.640
Speaker 3: we go through.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.300
Speaker 3: So

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.040
Speaker 3: I'm going to just pick out, I'm not going to focus too much on

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.940
Speaker 3: the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.880
Speaker 3: health and safety highlights. Of course we're happy to take questions on any of these items

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.140
Speaker 3: and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.220
Speaker 3: I'll move actually through to item two. I've already mentioned some of the work

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.920
Speaker 3: that's

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.220
Speaker 3: in item two that has come through from

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.740
Speaker 3: the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.820
Speaker 3: PBC Pacific.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.400
Speaker 3: and the strategic plan that's being developed there. And the goals of the academic leadership framework which were endorsed

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.520
Speaker 3: by

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.120
Speaker 3: the VCDD and which will be really important in terms of supporting

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.220
Speaker 3: student

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.959
Speaker 3: -centric decisions as we go forward. So

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.620
Speaker 3: very

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.760
Speaker 3: pleased to see that now starting to take shape and be implemented.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.480
Speaker 3: Under

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.740
Speaker 3: 2.9, just I think most of you will be aware but

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.400
Speaker 3: one

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.980
Speaker 3: of the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.160
Speaker 3: key issues around particularly the Covid agenda and with a new vice chancellor coming in

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.640
Speaker 3: has been the importance of

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.260
Speaker 3: me

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.340
Speaker 3: getting in front of the staff and having the staff across and aware of the developments

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.260
Speaker 3: and

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.900
Speaker 3: decisions that are being made in response to

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.760
Speaker 3: Covid

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.660
Speaker 3: -19 and also in preparation for our new strategy.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.680
Speaker 3: And so there have already been a couple of all staff forums.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.600
Speaker 3: These

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720
Speaker 3: would normally be face to face, but of course we're managing them

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.600
Speaker 3: online

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.740
Speaker 3: at the moment and there's going to be a further forum tomorrow

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.120
Speaker 3: with

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.180
Speaker 3: an opening to talk about what the IMT group are doing and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.800
Speaker 3: to

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.440
Speaker 3: talk more broadly about the student engagement and research activities.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.520
Speaker 3: They've

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:24.920
Speaker 3: been really well attended and we'll continue to do them throughout this period of time where we're unable to meet face to face. Importantly, there are numerous questions coming through those forums.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.880
Speaker 3: And

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:54.920
Speaker 3: what we've done is collated the questions that we've been unable to answer directly in the forum and put together a web page where we've got frequently asked questions where we're attempting to address the concerns and the questions of the staff, which of course are very broad and I'll come back to that in a moment. On item three, I wasn't going to spend too much time talking about the Fs. This is one of the things that of course we'll be talking about.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:13.700
Speaker 3: on the agenda later. But we've already heard today and the work that's ongoing that you're aware of from Auckland Online and the opportunities for the development of micro-credentials and the summer school activities which are referenced within this particular item.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.800
Speaker 3: Again,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.500
Speaker 3: happy to take questions on that and I'm sure

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.460
Speaker 3: that

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.000
Speaker 3: other members of the team would be willing to do so as well.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.980
Speaker 3: One

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.240
Speaker 3: thing just to say is that we did run a specific forum for all postgraduate students.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.240
Speaker 3: Jim

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:49.880
Speaker 3: led that with Carolyn last week and that was another really well attended forum and an important forum for the researchers and the postgrad students to think about how they can continue with business continuity in this period through the level three and potential level three alert lockdowns.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.660
Speaker 3: If I go then to item 4 here, high quality research, again

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.640
Speaker 3: we

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:15.340
Speaker 3: can see that there is some input this time from our PVC Pacific. We are going to be addressing a number of things related to ethics and research on our agenda later, so I'm going to leave it at that and go directly to Sustainable Autonomous University.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.960
Speaker 3: and

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.940
Speaker 3: acknowledging under 5.3 the major gifts and pledges

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.780
Speaker 3: that

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.880
Speaker 3: were received in January and February

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.800
Speaker 3: of

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.880
Speaker 3: this year, which are significant and outstanding. And you'll note the commentary there around

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.380
Speaker 3: the

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.240
Speaker 3: foundation. And of course,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.060
Speaker 3: in

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.900
Speaker 3: the first six weeks of my tenure, I have been able to write to our

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.760
Speaker 3: donors

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.660
Speaker 3: and alumni and attempt to

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.300
Speaker 3: keep

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.599
Speaker 3: a level of engagement around the activities

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.320
Speaker 3: both

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.060
Speaker 3: that they've committed to but also engage them in the activities that we're

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.800
Speaker 3: planning

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.400
Speaker 3: around the student student hardship going forward.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:56.820
Speaker 3: I'll

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.760
Speaker 3: continue to move through and I wanted to pick up

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.220
Speaker 3: on

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.660
Speaker 3: item seven and particularly around the treaty

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.500
Speaker 3: but

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.240
Speaker 3: to recognise

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.440
Speaker 3: actually

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.240
Speaker 3: the launch of the Toreo language plan

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.020
Speaker 3: which

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:15.580
Speaker 3: was launched on the 7th of April and this is a really significant achievement and I want to congratulate the team

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.400
Speaker 3: that have been involved

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.160
Speaker 3: in

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.340
Speaker 3: getting us to this point. And I believe tomorrow we're going to be able to launch the app

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.820
Speaker 3: that

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.000
Speaker 3: goes with that. So

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.940
Speaker 3: a

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.100
Speaker 3: really outstanding development there.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.320
Speaker 3: If

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.780
Speaker 3: I can then perhaps move on

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.219
Speaker 3: to, I

00:08:34.219 --> 00:08:36.700
Speaker 3: think I'll go directly to item nine.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.120
Speaker 3: As

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:44.700
Speaker 3: you will no doubt be aware, a significant amount of time has gone into the responses to COVID-19.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:58.520
Speaker 3: and that's quite a condensed report but it doesn't really take account of the extensive work that the team have been involved in and the staff have responded to and it's been phenomenal to see the way in which the staff have responded

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520
Speaker 3: to

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.960
Speaker 3: the significant ask

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.680
Speaker 3: that

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.780
Speaker 3: has been required of them over the last few weeks.

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:40.800
Speaker 3: I

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.640
Speaker 3: think

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.260
Speaker 3: it's worthwhile

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.880
Speaker 3: pointing out that under 9.4

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.960
Speaker 3: accommodation,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.240
Speaker 3: you may have

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.200
Speaker 3: read

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.100
Speaker 3: over the weekend that there was some media interest around

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.080
Speaker 3: the

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.560
Speaker 3: ways in which we've continued to

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.420
Speaker 3: charge

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.300
Speaker 3: student fees

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.380
Speaker 3: around

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.520
Speaker 3: accommodation and the comments around that from the various

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.480
Speaker 3: members

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.900
Speaker 3: of the community and from the community.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.920
Speaker 3: from members of parliament, but also

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.740
Speaker 3: particularly

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.740
Speaker 3: because different universities have taken a different tack on this.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:13.660
Speaker 3: We've

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.940
Speaker 3: been very clear about the way in which we've addressed this and

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:17.620
Speaker 3: have

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.560
Speaker 3: made a very

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.920
Speaker 3: detailed

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:32.360
Speaker 3: response to the media. They have not necessarily picked it all up with accuracy. And a lot of what was in the media at the weekend wasn't accurate, but we have been able to respond fully

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.040
Speaker 3: to

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.320
Speaker 3: the questions that have been

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.080
Speaker 3: asked

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.900
Speaker 3: of us, both

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.440
Speaker 3: from government and from

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.340
Speaker 3: parents

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.740
Speaker 3: who have been quite concerned about some of the things that they've been reading.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.140
Speaker 3: I think then finally I might just move to

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:49.880
Speaker 3: something

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.460
Speaker 3: that's not in the report today

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.300
Speaker 3: but

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.360
Speaker 3: it is relevant to the work that we're doing around the

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.400
Speaker 3: planning

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.700
Speaker 3: for the workforce of the future and

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.360
Speaker 3: particularly

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.379
Speaker 3: recognising that staff at the moment are of course concerned about employment security

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.300
Speaker 3: in

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:19.180
Speaker 3: the immediate term. And I've made very clear statements that no long-term plans will be made at the moment around the workforce planning because we're developing new strategy and it's going to be important that the strategy

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.220
Speaker 3: leads

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.000
Speaker 3: those decisions.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.500
Speaker 3: However,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.260
Speaker 3: we have received from the State Service Commission

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.540
Speaker 3: some

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.940
Speaker 3: information yesterday and today related to restriction

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.140
Speaker 3: around

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.360
Speaker 3: the pay and

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.120
Speaker 3: pay freezers

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.920
Speaker 3: for

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.780
Speaker 3: staff going forward and there'll be a communication going out around that

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.720
Speaker 3: tomorrow

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.220
Speaker 3: and we have an all staff form tomorrow so we'll make sure that we're really

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.040
Speaker 3: clear

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.200
Speaker 3: about the impact of that for staff

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.000
Speaker 3: having

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.840
Speaker 3: said that

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.540
Speaker 3: it's

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.900
Speaker 3: quite clear if you look at the information that's come through the state service commission that what's already been agreed

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.920
Speaker 3: through

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.400
Speaker 3: our

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.120
Speaker 3: enterprise

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.540
Speaker 3: bargaining will remain

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.340
Speaker 3: for

00:11:59.340 --> 00:11:59.820
Speaker 3: the period

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.220
Speaker 3: so

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.360
Speaker 3: i think i'll leave it at that i'm very happy to take questions

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.180
Speaker 3: on

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:14.960
Speaker 3: any matters of the report. And of course, happy Adrian, if you think there are other things that it might be worthwhile bringing to the council's attention.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.100
I

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:25.180
Speaker 1: just wonder, Dawn, look, there is so much work to do on the strategy and there is so much that we don't know, but

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.640
Speaker 1: you

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:33.940
Speaker 1: are evolving your thinking in terms of the way that you're going to communicate the evolution of the strategy.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:48.480
Speaker 1: and the communication and interaction with stakeholders going forward. Can you just comment on that most particularly for the benefit of folk who are listening in?

00:12:49.820 --> 00:13:04.300
Speaker 3: Thanks, Chancellor, for the opportunity to do that. So really importantly, recognising that the pressing, the most pressing activity for us at the moment is to develop that strategy and vision.

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:05.420
Speaker 3: And

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.520
Speaker 3: within that will be the five-year strategic plan,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.340
Speaker 3: a

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.240
Speaker 3: vision that takes us out way into the 2020s to 2030 and

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.080
Speaker 3: falling

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.420
Speaker 3: out of that, then the annual plans that are looked at on a three-year rolling cycle.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:21.440
Speaker 3: To

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.360
Speaker 3: do that and the process we're going to go through, it's going to be really important that we

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.220
Speaker 3: engage

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:32.380
Speaker 3: the staff and, in fact, the student body in that work, as well as our external stakeholders

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.240
Speaker 3: in

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.280
Speaker 3: a variety of ways.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:48.060
Speaker 3: in an interactive way. And so as we start to develop the green papers, these papers will be developed and indeed worked through a series of workshops and town halls

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.000
Speaker 3: and

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.440
Speaker 3: forums and our existing committee structures and our existing informal meeting structures by way of testing out

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.120
Speaker 3: our

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.960
Speaker 3: thinking, the horizon scanning,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.200
Speaker 3: how

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.340
Speaker 3: we want to be seen in the future, the value add that we can do.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.980
Speaker 3: can make into the future in terms of both our contribution to

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:08.740
Speaker 3: the

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.380
Speaker 3: nation but beyond that

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.060
Speaker 3: into

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:18.460
Speaker 3: Oceana and to ensure that we are engaging with staff in a way that they feel this is a strategy

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.240
Speaker 3: that

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.660
Speaker 3: we all own and share.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:21.520
Speaker 3: The

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:31.000
Speaker 3: most important part for me of that strategy is really about getting the people and culture settings right. So whilst it's important to be clear about purpose

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.040
Speaker 3: and

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.340
Speaker 3: important to be clear about the direction of

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:45.940
Speaker 3: of travel, it's the people and culture strategy that really sets the tone. And so going through the development of the strategy, we'll be making sure that we are involving people and

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.920
Speaker 3: giving

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.740
Speaker 3: some serious thought to the culture

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.860
Speaker 3: that

00:14:49.860 --> 00:15:01.520
Speaker 3: we are inhabiting within the university and how people interact with us and how we interact with others. And that's something that all staff can be involved in. So even if staff are not directly involved

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.260
Speaker 3: in

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.140
Speaker 3: the development of the research strategy,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:04.940
Speaker 3: or

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.060
Speaker 3: the campus master plan, the estate strategy or the financial targeted plan,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.060
Speaker 3: they

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.320
Speaker 3: will all have an opportunity to be a part of the values clarification

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.700
Speaker 3: and

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.580
Speaker 3: the defining characteristics of the university going forward.

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:20.980
Thank

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:30.680
Speaker 1: you. And just one point that might be of interest to also the folk on the call. Obviously, we're running our accommodation.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:48.740
Speaker 1: We still have a big pastoral care wrap around that, but we've also got a very large population of students still in the halls. Can you just refresh my memory as to how many students there are that we've still got on campus in the halls?

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.520
Yep,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.520
Speaker 3: I might just ask Adrian to give an update on that.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.460
Speaker 1: Something over a thousand I seem to.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.500
It's

00:15:59.500 --> 00:15:59.760
Speaker 4: about

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.360
1500.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:22.340
Speaker 1: 1,500. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Adrian, which I think is somewhat different to what you're seeing in some of the other jurisdictions or other institutions. So with that said, questions or comments from Council for the Vice-Chancellor.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:32.700
you

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:47.020
Speaker 2: say, Dawn, you prepared something that you sent to the media. I wonder if you could circulate that to Council so that we've got a clear understanding that when we're, you know, asked by people, that we have a clear understanding of what's going on with the accommodation.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.700
I

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:54.820
Speaker 3: think that's a really good idea Cecilia so we've we had a drafted response that went also out to

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.800
Speaker 3: Chloe

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.440
Speaker 3: Swarbrick and a few others who've been interested in knowing what we're doing so we've got some very

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.740
Speaker 3: very

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.280
Speaker 3: clear messages which may be helpful for you to be able to share if people are asking you.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.640
Speaker 2: That'd be great thank you.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.560
Speaker 5: Tonsa, just through you. Congratulations on the sustainability award, that's fantastic.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.319
Speaker 5: I'm

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:23.020
Speaker 5: not sure how big the application is, but it would be

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.900
Speaker 5: quite

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:39.460
Speaker 5: useful if it's not too big to pop that into the Resource Centre for Diligence so we can see what factors we're reporting on and what activities we're doing, because we don't really have a great deal of visibility of what was in that

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.780
Speaker 5: report

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.780
Speaker 5: or that application.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.180
Wendy

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.180
Speaker 1: could we perhaps get you to chase that up.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.500
It is

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.020
Speaker 6: extremely large. It

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.180
is

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.880
Speaker 3: quite extensive and Pamela I'm just wondering if you could do if there's a way of summarizing it in some way.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:07.000
Speaker 6: I think we would be better to summarize it because it's a response to quite specific questions and

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.640
Speaker 6: quite

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.380
Speaker 6: a large part of the set of information

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:19.700
Speaker 6: We don't actually have because they're research metrics that Thompson's Reuter, that Elsevier develop

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.400
Speaker 6: and

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:29.840
Speaker 6: that the Times Higher people use. So we have a set of scores that we can send through but the portfolio itself is quite

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.920
Speaker 5: considerable. Okay well maybe an executive summary then.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.740
Speaker 5: Yeah.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:42.380
Speaker 5: Thank you. And just in terms of the strategy I mean that's quite a

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:58.300
Speaker 5: useful piece of work, although a bit distracted at the moment with COVID-19 activities. Presumably that will also cover sort of our view of workforce for the future and any paradigm shifts and international versus domestic.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.480
So

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:06.340
Speaker 3: exactly that. So of course, part of the strategy, we're looking at the size, shape and composition of the university going forward

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.200
in

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:07.320
Speaker 7: the

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.760
Speaker 3: context of the global shift, which is a paradigm shift in

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:12.380
Speaker 3: high

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.860
Speaker 3: as well as

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.700
Speaker 3: what's

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.700
Speaker 3: relevant for us in terms of UOA in the nation and in our region.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.640
Speaker 3: That

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.840
Speaker 3: includes looking at for example the ratio of undergrad

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.680
Speaker 3: to

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.140
Speaker 3: postgrad, the ratio of international to domestic, the ratio, the mix

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:30.860
Speaker 3: in

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:42.380
Speaker 3: terms of discipline mix, there's a whole set of parameters that we look at there and of course there's also the volume and quality question as well because we're a research intensive university and it's important

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.860
Speaker 3: It's important that we make sure that what we develop is distinctive for the longer term.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.260
Speaker 3: Good.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:48.900
Speaker 3: Thank you.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.640
So

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:59.780
Speaker 4: other questions? Okay, so we will

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.980
Speaker 8: note that report. Thank you

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.540
for

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.580
Speaker 1: that. Can you hear me? Yes, go ahead, John.

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:12.380
Speaker 8: Yeah, I just wanted to ask Dawn. She mentioned that the Te Reo language

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:25.360
Speaker 8: Plan was being launched tomorrow. And she acknowledged Cindy and the team and I just want to tote that acknowledgement of them. But is that going to be accessible in any way for

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.760
Speaker 8: people

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.820
Speaker 8: like myself and others that are not on campus

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.580
Speaker 8: to

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.100
Speaker 8: have a look at?

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:33.960
Yeah,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.840
Speaker 3: so I'll make sure that

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.720
Speaker 3: we

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.600
Speaker 3: circulate the information around that about that to you, John, because

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.700
Speaker 3: the

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.380
Speaker 3: language plan

00:20:46.340 --> 00:21:02.560
Speaker 3: The app is going to be launched tomorrow. If it's not tomorrow, it will be Monday. But yes, that's something that I'm hopeful will mean that people will start to use that app as opposed to some of the other ones that are available that have been produced through the universities in New Zealand.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.960
Okay,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:19.340
Speaker 1: thanks. Right, so we'll note that report and we will move to Senate matters. And I think I saw John Morrow earlier. I think he's

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.500
Speaker 1: somewhere

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.660
Speaker 1: nearby. John, are you there?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.480
Speaker 9: Yes, I am, Scott, yes.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.000
I

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.840
Speaker 1: am comforted by that. Right, where are your hands?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.760
Okay,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.340
Speaker 9: thanks.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:39.660
Speaker 9: Thank you very much, Chancellor. Part A recommendations from Senate requiring to be considered

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.360
Speaker 9: and

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:53.340
Speaker 9: received by Council. Of the academic matters, there are four new academic programs which have been developed by the Faculty of Business and Economics, and we seek approval

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.400
Speaker 9: for

00:21:54.400 --> 00:22:03.220
Speaker 9: these programs to be advanced to QAP for its consideration. These programs are interesting.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:33.380
Speaker 9: ones. The first involves changes to the Bachelor of Commerce, the major undergraduate term qualification in that faculty. And the main points about the change are to introduce a multidisciplinary core of four courses in the first year, and also to produce a capstone or to acquire a capstone course in the last year of study, which gives

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:51.160
Speaker 9: students and give students an opportunity to integrate what they've learned over the course of their studies. And this revised program reflects the outcome of program reviews and significant work by the faculty.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.480
Speaker 9: In

00:22:53.480 --> 00:23:03.380
Speaker 9: addition, there are three postgraduate qualifications, a Master of Business Analytics, a Master of

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:30.860
Speaker 9: A Master of Business with some discrete specialisations and also a Master of Information Governance. The last of these programmes has been developed by the Department of Commercial Law. These programmes are all available in 180 or 120 versions for candidates with appropriate entry qualifications.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:50.200
Speaker 9: And these programs reflect the faculty's attempt to identify new areas which will meet the needs of the business and wider community in New Zealand. That's all I have to say on the Senate matters, Chancellor.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:54.820
So

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:59.340
Speaker 1: questions for John regarding the Senate matters.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:09.820
Speaker 5: Okay. Sorry, Scott. Sorry, John.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.560
Speaker 5: Can

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:20.860
Speaker 5: you just confirm to me, does the capstone course, it doesn't add time to the sort of minimum time of the degree, does it?

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.800
No,

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:31.100
Speaker 9: it's part of the regular structure of the program, and it's taken typically in the last semester of the

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.040
Speaker 9: last semester of study. So that's a

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.260
Speaker 5: compulsory course.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:44.880
Speaker 9: It's a compulsory course. Students have have a great deal of flexibility about what particular focus they take in in responding to that opportunity.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.820
Right. Okay. Which

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.160
Speaker 5: is quite a quite a change for the commerce degree.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:00.340
Speaker 9: It is yes and it follows capstones which have been introduced in other in other in other programs.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.920
So

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:09.360
Speaker 5: this will be part of our strategic thinking then, going forward.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.100
Speaker 5: If

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.460
Speaker 5: it's considered an appropriate way to

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.220
Speaker 5: close

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.600
Speaker 5: out a course, then

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.440
Speaker 5: perhaps

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.720
Speaker 5: it's applicable across the wide range of courses.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.820
Yes,

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:30.120
Speaker 9: I think that's the case. And it provides students with an opportunity to reflect on the range of components that they've studied in the course of a programme.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.680
Speaker 9: and to pull them together in some sort of coherent and interesting way.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:36.340
Speaker 9: Okay,

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.000
Speaker 1: thank you.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:44.160
Speaker 1: And I know there was a really good list of people who had input into that work.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.360
Speaker 1: So anything else on Senate?

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.820
Speaker 1: That

00:25:50.820 --> 00:26:00.060
Speaker 1: being the case, I will move that the recommendations in part of the report of Senate from April this year be adopted.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.480
Speaker 1: and that Part B and C be noted. Can I have a seconder, please?

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:05.520
Speaker 5: I will.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.300
Speaker 1: Thank you very much. Who was that? Who was it?

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:10.820
Speaker 5: Kath.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:27.640
Speaker 1: Kath, beautiful. There you are. There's your smiling face. It's tricky. All those in favour say aye. Aye. Against. Carried. Thank you. So we'll move to correspondence.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:48.800
Speaker 1: echoing what Dawn said a little earlier, I got as Chancellor last night a note from Peter Hughes, who's Head of State Services, just encouraging pay restraints. So there's nothing new in that.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.320
Speaker 1: So

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.300
Speaker 1: is there any other correspondence that I'm not aware of

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.020
Speaker 1: that

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.220
Speaker 1: I need to be aware of? No.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:06.720
Speaker 1: So we will move to item 9. Other decisions for noting. Is there anything else?

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.560
Speaker 1: I

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.620
Speaker 1: don't think so. Is there any general business?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.700
Speaker 1: Anyone

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.580
Speaker 1: require a leave of absence?

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.340
Speaker 1: That

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:28.700
Speaker 1: being the case, we will move to part B and I will move that the public be excluded from part B of this meeting.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:47.820
Speaker 1: However, that Adrian Clelland, Professors Metson, Morrow and Morrow, Peter Gutzel, Pamela Moss, Todd Somerville, Bridget Fitzpatrick, Wendy and Richard Elliott be permitted to remain.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.560
Speaker 1: And

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.460
Speaker 1: with that said, we will move to part B.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:27:59.900
Speaker 1: Do you need to give

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.160
Speaker 4: me

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.020
Speaker 4: a

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:15.260
Speaker 4: signal? Maybe. We're all good, Scott. Thank you. We're all

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:15.680
Speaker 4: good.
