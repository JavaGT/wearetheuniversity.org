Vice-Chancellor’s message to Boston University Students
=======================================================

On behalf of the Council, staff and students of The University of Auckland, I offer our deepest condolences and support to the families and friends of those students who lost their lives or were injured in Saturday’s tragic car accident.

During this very difficult time, counsellors are available for any student who needs support. Please contact University Counselling Services. We will discuss with students the possibility of holding a remembrance service later this week.

If there is anything we can do to assist you, please contact Rebecca Walkinton in the International Student Information Centre on +64 (0)9 373 7599 ext 86911 or at [r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz).

I am very grateful to the staff of the International Office and Counselling Services, and a number of our academic staff, who have done so much to support the students and their families since the accident.”
