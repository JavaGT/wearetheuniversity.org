How to make Auckland better
===========================

30 August 2016

“Liveability” of cities is a slippery concept, its definition changing depending on who you ask. Common themes are strong, inclusive neighbourhoods, accessibility and sustainable ways of getting around, a diverse and resilient local economy, vibrant public spaces and affordability.

Aucklanders know acutely how these are all interlinked. Unaffordable house prices and rent drive out families whose skills and energy Auckland needs to retain; traffic congestion is a drain on economic productivity; air pollution is responsible for the premature deaths of an estimated 200 Aucklanders every year; and whole families are being shut out of the great Kiwi lifestyle we so like to boast about.

A series of public events starting on Tuesday 30 August is bringing together business leaders, economists, academics, policy analysts and entrepreneurs to unpack these issues. The Ballot Box series was developed by the University of Auckland Business School to look beyond the three-year election cycle and encourage an informed conversation.  

Professor Greg Whittred, Dean of the Business School, says the well-being of Auckland and the rest of New Zealand are inextricably linked.

“This matters for the country, as well as Auckland. Auckland is one of a handful of cities globally that generate more than a third of their country's GDP.”

### **EVENTS:**

### **Auckland: the Inclusive City - Tuesday 30 August**

In 2015, the OECD highlighted inequality as one of the key risks facing New Zealand. Expect lively discussion of how the social and economic impact of inequality threatens the city’s future prospects, and what can be done.

The line-up features independent economist Shamubeel Eaqub; Rangimarie Hunia, director of the property and investment arm of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei; University of Auckland Associate Professor of Economics Susan St John; and Alan Johnson, The Salvation Army social policy analyst.

### **Auckland: The Innovative City – Wednesday 7 September**

This event will interrogate how Auckland can, and must, become a crucible for innovation.

Whittred says developing a city where young people want to study, work and build a career is the challenge ahead for Auckland's new mayor and councillors as they begin to roll out the Unitary Plan.

"An innovative city attracts knowledge workers. It has a large education precinct located centrally and an environment where students are not only encouraged to stay - but want to stay,” he says.

"It's a city full of young professionals with venues and opportunities created to allow them to bump into each other, like innovation hubs and co-working spaces, collaborative spaces, and the kind of infrastructure that doesn't exist widely just yet. The amenities and quality of life in the city need to be truly cosmopolitan and appeal to the younger generation."

Speakers are: inaugural CEO of Callaghan Innovation Dr Mary Quin; entrepreneurs Greg Cross and Nick Shewring; high-profile University of Auckland scientist Professor Shaun Hendy; and Wendy Kerr, director of the Business School’s Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.

### **Auckland: The Sustainable City – Thursday 22 September**

Auckland generates more emissions per person than London or New York. The city is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which will affect the region's economy, infrastructure, natural resources, biodiversity, and quality of life.

Speakers will discuss how to move Auckland to a high-growth, low-carbon eco-economy.

“Businesses across all sectors need to be leading this transition,” says Whittred. “Smart companies grasp the huge economic opportunities it offers, for example in exporting clean technology.”

The line-up is: high-profile businessman Michael Stiassny; senior sustainability adviser at Panuku Development Auckland, Viv Hyslop; business journalist, writer and media commentator Rod Oram; Professor Basil Sharp, director of the Energy Centre at the Business School; and Barry Coates, former head of Oxfam New Zealand who’s now leading a sustainability programme at the Business School.
