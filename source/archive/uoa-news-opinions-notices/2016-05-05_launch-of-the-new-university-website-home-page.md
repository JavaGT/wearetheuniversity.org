Launch of the new University website home page
==============================================

We will be launching the new University website home page this month.

The home page will have a new design that is user-focused, mobile compatible, and which will link to content on the existing website.

Over the coming months we will redesign and launch the rest of the website. This will mean there will be a temporary period where you will see both the new and existing webpages.

We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.

We value your feedback which can be sent to: [webprogramme@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:webprogramme@auckland.ac.nz)
