Dome brings to life rich world of sound
=======================================

A large dome being constructed inside the Kenneth Myers Centre in Shortland Street, Auckland, will bring to life a unique three-dimensional world of sound.  
  
The ‘acousmatic’ SoundDome, 8 metres in diameter and 5 metres high, is fitted with 23 Genelec loudspeakers and 35 cubic metres of Autex sound insulation, and is specifically designed as an instrument for composing in space.

Dr John Coulter, Co-ordinator of the Sonic Arts Programme at the University of Auckland’s School of Music, says “the SoundDome is an intersection between sound, technology and space that will allow participants to experience sound that was previously conceivable only in the composer’s imagination.”  
  
The innovative hardware and software design provides a state-of-the-art relocatable venue, engineered to support different genres of sonic art.

One of the techniques employed spatialises sound, manipulating its projection and localisation, to give it material properties and produce sonic objects.

Although this technique is still in its infancy, it has been identified as a game changer for sonic artists and designers.

Acknowledging the inspirational work and influence of composers Douglas Lilburn and John Cousins, the SoundDome, which can hold up to 9 people, celebrates the tradition of sound-based composition in New Zealand.

Next week sound lovers can luxuriate in sonic art at premier performances of ground-breaking acousmatic work (music for loudspeakers) by composers John Coulter and David Downes.  
  
Open to the public, the one night only event will take place inside the SoundDome at the Kenneth Myers Centre on Friday 15 July.

There will be five performances, each fifty minutes long, bringing to life a world of sound. To find out more visit [SoundDome](http://goo.gl/6owPHx).
