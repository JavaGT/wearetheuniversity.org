2011 University Calendar on the web
===================================

You can access the University Calendar online. The Calendar provides information about academic programmes and courses together with academic statutes and regulations governing admission, enrolment, fees and examinations. The Calendar also contains details about the University, its staff and key academic and general information.  
  
The new Google Search Calendar facility allows keyword searches for the entire Calendar content.  
  
The Online Calendar follows the same content and layout as the print version. You can easily browse, view and print information in discrete sections. iCal subscription to the Academic Year dates (under Dates section) allows you to keep track of major semester and quarter dates.  
  
In addition, the Calendar Updates section contains all amendments to the Calendar subsequent to its publication in November each year.
