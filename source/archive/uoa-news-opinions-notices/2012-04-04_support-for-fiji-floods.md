Support for Fiji floods
=======================

The University of Auckland extends its sympathy to the Fijian community on campus and in the wider community for the extensive devastation caused by the recent floods.

“The University has had a long-standing and mutually beneficial relationship with the people of Fiji. We continue to be the university of choice for Fijians seeking tertiary education in New Zealand and we are proud to count numerous Fijians amongst our alumni,” says the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

“As a favourite holiday destination, there will be many who have enjoyed the warm hospitality of Fijians who will also be greatly saddened by the devastation and will no doubt join the University in extending their sympathies to the Fijian people at this challenging time.”

Donations can be made to the Fijian Red Cross, which is leading disaster relief efforts including the distribution of disaster relief packs: [www.redcross.com.fj](http://www.redcross.com.fj/).
