Margaret Hyland, Professor of Engineering and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Engineering.

Margaret Hyland, Professor of Engineering and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Auckland, has been appointed Chief Scientist to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE).

Professor Hyland is seconded from the University to her new role. She will head the Science Leadership team at the Ministry, providing thought leadership in science strategies and their implementation, and provide a critical connection between MBIE and the science community.

Professor Hyland is a Fellow of the Institute of Chemical Engineers (UK) and the first woman to chair the International Metals, Minerals and Materials Society Aluminium Committee.

She is a pioneer in the field of reducing pollution from the production of aluminium and in particular developing new technologies that have resulted in cost-effective methods to reduce gaseous and particulate emissions from aluminium smelting.

Her work has been recognised through a number of national and international awards including the Metals and Materials Society Awards in which she has featured five times.

In 2015 she was awarded the Pickering Medal by the Royal Society of New Zealand, the first woman to receive the award.

Dean of Engineering at the University of Auckland Professor Nic Smith said Professor Hyland would be an asset to the Ministry.

“Margaret has made an enormous contribution across a range of major projects for our Faculty and her passionate leadership in areas such as equity, teaching and learning have been hugely valuable,” he said.

“I wish her the very best in this new and exciting role.”

Professor Hyland is seconded to the Ministry for two years but will continue to be a full academic member of the Faculty of Engineering’s Chemical & Materials Engineering Department.

She takes up the Chief Scientist role for MBIE role on 1 February, 2017.
