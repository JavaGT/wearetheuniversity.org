Medical specialists to visit this year
======================================

This year’s visiting Seelye Fellows include a psychologist, a neuropsychologist, and an obstetrician specialising in the placenta.

First to arrive at the University of Auckland will be obstetrician, **Dr Sally Collins** from the University of Oxford, who was invited by Dr Joanna James in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

Dr Collins is a highly esteemed clinical researcher specialising in placental blood flow, Doppler ultrasound and foetal growth.

During her public lecture (on Monday 29 February), Dr Collins will talk about her work on the use of ultrasound to better understand the placenta.  
She will also participate in a workshop on ‘The Placenta: A key mediator of Foetal Development’, at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences on February 25 and 26.

Her presentation will look at what ultrasound can teach us about ‘the nature of blood flow to the placental surface in normal and pathological pregnancies’, as part of a planned session on utero-placental blood flow.

In late October, **Professor Daniel S. Shaw**, visits from the University of Pittsburg where he has a distinguished career in clinical and developmental psychology.  
Professor Shaw was invited by Associate Professor Trecia Wouldes from the Department of Psychological Medicine at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences.

His research interests are the developmental outcomes of high-risk boys and the prevention of adolescent alcohol, drug use and psychopathology.

A longitudinal study has provided important evidence for the effects of early adversity on later developmental outcomes, particularly for boys. He specialises in how to identify conduct disorders early in children and has modelled a new intervention for high risk children called the Family Check-up Model.  He is also researching how to apply this model for intervention with children to help prevent alcohol and drug use.

Neuropsychologist, **Professor Juan-Carlos Arango**, was nominated by Distinguished Professor Richard Faull ONZM, Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences and will visit in the latter half of the year.

He is from the University of Deusdo in Bilbao in northern Spain, and is a neuropsychologist who over the last 15 years has established a pre-eminent international standing in the rehabilitation of people affected by dementia, traumatic brain injury and stroke.

Professor Arango has made significant contributions to the state of knowledge in brain injury research including determining the influence of cultural factors on the rehabilitation outcomes of individuals with dementia.
