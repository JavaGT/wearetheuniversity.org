NZ Centre at Peking University marks 10th anniversary
=====================================================

The importance and strength of the New Zealand-China relationship has been honoured with a celebration to mark the 10th anniversary of the New Zealand Centre in Beijing.

The Centre, located at Peking University (PKU), is a unique partnership between one of China’s most prestigious universities and academics and researchers at all eight New Zealand universities. It promotes the study of New Zealand in China and contributes to the China-New Zealand relationship.

The Centre was launched in 2007 by then Foreign Minister, Rt Hon Winston Peters. Earlier this week, Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Hon Paul Goldsmith joined the celebration at PKU, along with PKU’s President and University Council Chairman and representatives of New Zealand’s eight universities.

NZC Advisory Board Chairperson and University of Auckland Deputy Vice- Chancellor (Strategic Engagement) Professor Jenny Dixon says when the Centre was launched a decade ago by the University its aim was to be a major nexus of academic, political and business collaboration between New Zealand and China.

“We have seen the Centre flourish with increasing numbers of NZ academics involved with the Centre and research, significant numbers of Chinese students taking an English language _New Zealand History and Culture_ course, an annual summer school language visit to New Zealand by Chinese students and internships for NZ students at the Centre.”

In April 2016 a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed at a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing affirming and strengthening the relationships underpinning the New Zealand Centre.

“The Centre is now looking forward to the next phase of its development when it becomes a catalyst for greater interest in China within New Zealand and New Zealand within China. Current plans include broadening the interdisciplinary role for the Centre and increasing the opportunities for senior New Zealand academics to develop research collaborations with China, supported by business and jointly funded government programmes,” Professor Dixon says.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Education New Zealand support the Centre.
