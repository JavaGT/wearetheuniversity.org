New earthquake resilient technology for buildings receives MBIE funding
=======================================================================

14 September 2016

A new structural joint technology which improves earthquake resilience in existing and new buildings, pioneered at the University of Auckland, has received funding of $3.4m from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

Called the Resilient Slip-Friction Joint (RSFJ), the invention is a structural connection that absorbs seismic energy during earthquakes and aftershocks and forces the building components to return to their original position.

The joint was developed within the University of Auckland’s Civil & Environmental Engineering department by former Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Pouyan Zarnani and Head of Department Professor Pierre Quenneville.

The technology will soon undergo testing at the Newmarket Campus. This will involve full-scale mimicking action of earthquakes to monitor performance of the joint and structural components.

The project is a collaborative effort involving the University of Auckland and AUT University.

“The RSFJ will allow buildings to withstand seismic activity and minimise the damage of earthquake events,” Professor Quenneville says. “The fact it can be used to retrofit buildings is a real bonus in terms of ensuring high standards of safety within existing infrastructure.”

The slip friction joint also aims to minimise business disruption by allowing people back into a building much quicker.

“Becoming more earthquake resilient is also about making economic recovery quicker because if you need to completely re-build, then business is going to be disrupted for longer.”

Dean of Engineering Professor Nic Smith said the RSFJ was a great example of the outstanding research being done within Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Auckland.

“I’m extremely proud of the team, this funding will provide the ability to accelerate the development of highly innovative technology that has real potential for application in New Zealand and around the world,” he said.

The slip friction joint has high potential outside New Zealand in areas prone to seismic events including other Pacific basin nations.

After excellent feedback from academic and construction industry experts, the team behind the RSFJ technology is gearing up to bring this product to market through Tectonus Limited.
