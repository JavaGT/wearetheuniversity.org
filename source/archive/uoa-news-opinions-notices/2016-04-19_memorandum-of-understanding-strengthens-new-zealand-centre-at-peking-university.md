Memorandum of Understanding strengthens New Zealand Centre at Peking University
===============================================================================

19 April 2016

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and NZ Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key today witnessed the signing of an agreement to strengthen the NZ Centre at Peking University (PKU).

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) reflects the importance of the NZ Centre to New Zealand and its Chinese university partner.

Peking University President Lin Jianhua, Victoria University of Wellington Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford, and University of Auckland Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Strategic Engagement) Professor Jenny Dixon signed the MOU at the Great Hall of the People. The Memorandum will ultimately be signed by all eight NZ universities.

\"The NZ Centre is a unique partnership between one of China's most prestigious universities and New Zealandâ€™s academics and researchers. It promotes the study of NZ in China and contributes to the strengthening of the deep relationship between China and NZ."

The Centre offers an undergraduate elective course on New Zealand which is taught in English, facilitates exchanges of researchers between PKU and New Zealand universities, and provides a forum for policy dialogue. An annual summer school is held in New Zealand for PKU students.

The Centre was initially established by the University of Auckland in 2007 and joined soon by four other NZ universities: the University of Otago, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Waikato and the University of Canterbury. Massey University, AUT and Lincoln University joined later.

The Centre is also supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Education NZ.
