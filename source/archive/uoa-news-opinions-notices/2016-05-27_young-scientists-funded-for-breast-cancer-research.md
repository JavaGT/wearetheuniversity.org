Young scientists funded for breast cancer research

Dr Dean Singleton

Breast cancer research was advanced this week with the funding of two exceptional projects by University of Auckland scientists.

The two researchers were this year’s recipients of the Belinda Scott Fellowship Programme, funded by the NZ Breast Cancer Foundation (NZBCF).

The grant recipients are Dr Dean Singleton and Dr Anita Muthukaruppan who will each receive $80,000 to complete their research projects.

The Fellowship Programme is a medical research grant awarded each year to fund innovative breast cancer research by a New Zealand scientist, focussed on the improvement of breast cancer survivorship.

At the conclusion of the projects, the recipients will share their findings and discoveries with the Foundation and the wider medical community through the publication of articles in medical journals.

This is the first year that the Foundation has had the resources to grant two fellowships.

**Dr Dean Singleton** is a research fellow working in the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre at the University of Auckland.

He gained his BSc and PhD at the University of Auckland before travelling to Oxford to work with renowned cancer researcher, Professor Adrian Harris.

Dr Singleton’s project will investigate the potential of newly developed epigenetic inhibitors for targeting hypoxic cells in breast tumours. These hypoxic (oxygen starved) cancer cells are aggressive and more likely to spread.

Dr Singleton’s work could help prevent the spread of cancer and improve patient survival.

Dr Anita Muthukaruppan

**Dr Anita Muthukaruppan** is a research fellow working in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology with Professor Andrew Shelling at the University of Auckland.

After gaining her BSc, she worked at the Kolling Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, before returning to Auckland to complete her PhD.

Dr Muthukaruppan’s research will explore the role of FOXA1 gene variant in breast cancer. She will investigate the particular genetic mutations that affect whether or not hormone therapy will work in individual patients and if certain FOXA1 genetic mutations will drive breast cancer development.

This information will allow doctors to better personalise cancer treatment so that each patient will receive the medicine that will work best for them.

“The NZ Breast Cancer Foundation is committed to pushing for new frontiers in early detection and treatment of breast cancer and support for patients,” says the chief executive of the Foundation, Evangelia Henderson.

“Hypoxia and the role of genes in hormone therapy are both areas of great interest to us, and to researchers worldwide,” she says. “When we were reviewing the research project proposals, both these applicants stood out and were very highly regarded by our assessing committee.

“We will be very interested to see the results of these studies and the contribution their findings could make in the treatment of breast cancer,” she says. “We congratulate our recipients and are excited by the calibre of research happening in New Zealand, and the hope it offers to breast cancer patients and their families.”

The Fellowships are funded by donations from the New Zealand public to the Foundation, through various fundraising activities like the Pink Ribbon Breakfast in Mayand other fundraising events during October, as well as sponsor donations.

**Quick facts about breast cancer in New Zealand:**

*   More than 3000 women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer in New Zealand – that’s eight women a day  
    90-95 percent of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of the disease
*   Around 350 New Zealand women under the age of 45 (when free mammograms start) will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year – that’s one woman a day
*   While breast cancer has a good cure rate when found early, many women have their cancer come back: only 73 percent will be disease-free 10 years after diagnosis
*   More than 600 women will die of breast cancer this year – about the size of a large primary school.
*   The New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation recommends women consider having yearly breast screening mammograms at age 40-49 years of age, then screen every two years from age 50. For more information go to www.nzbcf.org.nz
