University of Auckland defends coveted Shield
=============================================

11 October 2017

Sports Coordinator Tiwai Wilson and Sports Manager Albie Eaton are presented with the Shield by UTSNZ CEO Sarah Anderson.

The University of Auckland has once again claimed the ultimate trophy in tertiary sport.

Fierce rivalry surrounds the University & Tertiary Sport New Zealand (UTSNZ) Shield, which is presented annually to the tertiary provider with the greatest combined points from UTSNZ sporting events and championships held throughout the year.

Points were gathered from popular sports such as netball, futsal, rugby 7s, badminton and hockey. The University of Auckland entered the tournament as defending champions.

The ‘Shield’, as it is known among students, is one of the country’s oldest sporting prizes with a history stretching back 94 years.

“This year more universities were participating in the events, everyone has improved from 2016 and we are definitely seen as the ones to beat,” says Albie Eaton, the University’s Sports and Recreation Manager.

She adds: “We see participation in sporting tournaments and events as key to developing successful students who will go on to be leaders in their careers and lives.”

Notably the Shield had a five year hiatus after Student Union membership became voluntary in 2011 and the viability of inter-tertiary sporting tournaments declined.

The Shield was reinstated by the new University and Tertiary Sport New Zealand body, set up in 2016 by New Zealand University Vice-Chancellors to re-establish competitive sport pathways and inter-tertiary competition for student athletes.

The University of Auckland also has a robust interfaculty sporting competition with 11 sports represented, as well as a successful social sports league.

Highlights from the year’s tournaments:

*   Futsal: the University of Auckland men’s team claimed gold over a strong effort from reigning champions Victoria University in the finals of this popular indoor sport. Our women’s team also came home with Silver after overcoming AUT.
*   Badminton: the University won its third consecutive national title.
*   Hockey: our men’s and women’s teams both got second but won the most points overall.
*   Table tennis: first place for both our men’s and women’s teams.
*   Volleyball: our men’s team claimed first place and our women’s team second place, with the University winning the most points all overall.
