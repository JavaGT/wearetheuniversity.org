Sympathy for Cyclone Evan victims
=================================

The University of Auckland extends its sympathy to the Samoan and Fijian communities for the extensive devastation caused by Cyclone Evan.

“The University has had a long-standing and mutually beneficial relationship with the people of Samoa and Fiji. There will be many New Zealanders who have enjoyed the warm hospitality of our Pacific Island neighbours who will also be greatly saddened by the devastation and will no doubt join the University in extending their sympathies to our Samoan and Fijian communities at this challenging time.” says the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

Donations can be made to the Red Cross, which is leading disaster relief efforts including the distribution of disaster relief packs in both Samoa and Fiji. Mr Andrew McKie, the International Operations and Emergencies Manager says that they are working in a co-ordinated way with MFAT and reiterated that if people wanted to help then they are best to do so by donating online: “We are asking people not to donate goods. If people want to help they can follow the links on [www.redcross.org.nz](http://www.redcross.org.nz/) and select the _Pacific Disaster Response Fund_ from the drop down box.”
