The rising popularity of futsal among tertiary students was demonstrated last week when four University of Auckland students were named as Futsal Ferns.

They are set to make history as part of New Zealand’s first ever female national futsal team in one of the world’s fastest growing sports.

They are Science student Shivanthi Anthony and Arts student Hannah Kraakman, both from Auckland, Commerce student Hannah Robert from Palmerston North, and Maxine Cooper from Wellington, who is studying Medicine.

Joining them will be more familiar faces from the University’s futsal circuit.

University of Auckland Sports Coordinator Tracey Spray has been named Team Manager for the Futsal Ferns; and Nic Downes, who coached the University of Auckland Women’s Futsal tertiary team to second place at the New Zealand Tertiary Nationals in April, is the Futsal Ferns’ coach.

Marvin Eakins, who coaches the University’s men's futsal team, has again been appointed head coach of the Futsal Whites.

In addition, one of the University’s male students was named in the Men’s squad, Luke Maynard from Napier, a first-year Biomedical Science student.

The growth in the sport’s popularity has resulted in a talent pool strong enough to support a national squad.

Over the past three years Tracey developed a successful Interfaculty Futsal Tournament within the University. She also managed the University of Auckland teams at the National championships.

“I really found a passion for futsal when I started managing our teams three years ago, so I’m absolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to work with the best and be part of a historic moment in New Zealand sport,” Tracey says.

The Futsal Ferns will start their new chapter off with a three match tournament at the Trans Pacific Futsal Cup in Tauranga next month, where they will face off against New Caledonia.

While this is the first time an official senior national team has been formed, six players from the Futsal Ferns did represent New Zealand at the 2016 FISU World University Championship.
