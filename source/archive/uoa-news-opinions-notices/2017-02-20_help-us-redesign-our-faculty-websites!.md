Help us redesign our faculty websites!
======================================

We are busy working on creating brand new sites for our faculties.

If you are thinking about studying at the University - especially if you are looking at postgraduate study - or if you are a member of the public who interacts with the University, we would really appreciate if you could answer some questions about how we structure the faculty websites.

It shouldn't take more than 5 - 15 minutes of your time.
