New Justice advisory role for Dr Ian Lambie
===========================================

11 December 2015

Associate Professor Ian Lambie from the University of Auckland’s School of Psychology has been appointed Justice Sector Science Advisor.

In his new role, Dr Lambie will advise on all aspects of the Justice sector including Corrections, Police, Justice, Crown Law and the Serious Fraud Office.

Secretary for Justice Andrew Bridgman said the role would help improve the lives of New Zealanders by advising on the use of best evidence in cross-sector work to reduce crime, victimisation and harm.

Dr Lambie has more than 25 years’ experience as a clinical psychologist in youth offending and youth justice. Over the course of his career he has built strong relationships across the Judiciary, Police and Corrections.

“I am very much looking forward to this new position, it is an area that is very close to my heart and one in which I feel I can make a real contribution,” Dr Lambie said.

“The Justice sector has many skilled and talented people who work on developing good, sound policy and I see my role as supporting that work and promoting science and research to help formulate policies to reduce crime and victimisation.”

Dr Lambie worked for ten years as a clinical psychologist before joining the University of Auckland in 1990 where he has produced a significant body of research on youth offending. His research focuses on adolescents who sexually offend, children who deliberately light fires and children displaying violent and antisocial behaviour.

University of Auckland Dean of Science Professor John Hosking congratulated Dr Lambie on his new appointment.

“Ian is not only extremely experienced and knowledgeable in this field but is highly respected across the sector and I offer my sincere congratulations to him and wish him every success.”

Dr Lambie will continue to work at the University after taking up his new role.

The Justice Sector Science Advisor appointment is part of a network of science advisors established across government by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor and University of Auckland Distinguished Professor Sir Peter Gluckman.
