**The University of Auckland is today hosting representatives from partner institutions in China, Tsinghua University and Qinghai University.**

Tsinghua University Chairman Professor CHEN Xu, Qinghai Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Gang CHEN and their delegations met with Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Hon Steven Joyce briefly this morning before an extensive programme of activities at the University.

The three universities have been engaged in a Three Brothers partnership since 2007.This partnership links the University of Auckland with the prestigious Tsinghua University and western university, Qinghai to support its growth and development. University of Auckland researchers have engaged with academics at both universities in a number of research projects over the last nine years.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Strategic Engagement) Professor Jenny Dixon says: “We are very proud of the depth and breadth of relationships we have developed with Tsinghua and Qinghai during this period and we look forward to discussing how we will progress this partnership into the future.” The Three Brothers Agreement expires in August 2017.

Tsinghua University, along with Peking University, has recently broken into the top 100 universities in the Academic Rankings of World Universities compiled by the independent Shanghai Ranking Consultancy.  Tsinghua is the top ranked mainland Chinese university, at 58th.
