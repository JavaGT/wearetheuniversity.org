Hyper Reality performance aims to awe audience
==============================================

Architects, choreographers, dancers, composers, musicians, designers and computer programmers have joined forces to present a unique hyper real experience that will alter the way we view contemporary performance, data and space.

_Singularity_, taking place at Rangatira Theatre for one night only, blends data, dance, music and architecture in a ground-breaking immersive event designed to transport the audience into spaces of awe and delight.

Using interactive holographic environments and creative technologies directed by architect Associate Professor Uwe Rieger, designed and programmed by Yinan Liu and Ying Miao, and choreographed by Associate Professor Carol Brown with dancers Zahra Killeen-Chance, Adam Naughton and Solomon Holly-Massey, clouds of data will become wormholes, kites, watery walls and particle streams in response to dancers’ movement.  
  
Employing disruptive technologies to move data beyond a two-dimensional computer screen, _Singularity_ will present a visual and tactile experience that makes tangible the multiple ways that data flows permeate our lives.  
  
With music by French techno composer Jérôme Soudan, and sound design by Russell Scoones, sonic atmospheres and rhythms will also shape the event.  
  
The arc/sec Lab for Digital Spatial Operations at the University of Auckland’s School of Architecture and Planning has developed the _Singularity_ technical system led by Associate Professor Uwe Rieger. The audience can find out more about the project following the performance.
