New opportunities for University of Auckland students and researchers in Latin America.
=======================================================================================

Up to 20 Mexican students will be able to study full PhD degrees at the University of Auckland every year as the result of a new reciprocal agreement with Mexican state funding agency Conacyt.

The significant agreement will provide scholarship funding for the Mexican students, and also provides for short-term research visits of up to 12 months for New Zealand PhD students wishing to study at accredited Mexican universities.  University of Auckland masters students are able to apply for funding for up to six months.

The arrangement follows the recent visit of newly appointed Mexican ambassador Jose Gerardo Trasloheros who visited the University to meet with Dean of Graduate Studies Caroline Daley, Deputy Vice Chancellor Strategic Engagement Jenny Dixon, and International Office staff involved in the negotiation.

The new agreement follows on from last week’s announcement of the Prime Minister’s Scholarships to Latin America, a scheme providing funding for visits of university students wishing to study for up to two years in the region.

The first round of scholarships is now open for applications from individuals and groups until 30 October 2016.  The programme is initially focused on encouraging students to visit Colombia and Brazil, but students wishing to undertake studies in Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Peru can also apply.

The government’s announcement also marks a period of renewed interest in engagement with Latin America, following on from John Key’s 2013 visit to Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, and last year’s decision to open a New Zealand embassy in Bogota.

The announcement aligns with the government’s Business Growth Agenda for the region and its plan to strengthen trade and relationships in Latin America.  The government has also signalled interest in a relationship with the Pacific Alliance, a trade bloc made up of Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru.

Ambassador Trasloheros welcomed New Zealand’s new level of engagement with partners in Latin America, and highlighted a rising awareness of opportunities for Mexican students to take advantage of research and study opportunities in New Zealand, and make connections with Asia.

“Increasingly New Zealand is being viewed by Latin America as a bridge to Asia, an area we would like to know better,” says Ambassador Trasloheros.  “Study in New Zealand will allow our students to build networks with New Zealanders, and also to connect with Asian students that they meet while studying in Auckland.”
