Danielle Fuemana could not decide which degree to take at University so she enrolled in two.

This week Danielle, 23, of Te Atatu South, graduated from the University of Auckland with a conjoint Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Property degree.

She was one of 3160 people to gain qualifications at the Spring Graduation Ceremonies on Tuesday 27 September either in person or absentia, and one of 72 people to gain two qualifications.

Her conjoint degree, designed for more able students, took five-and-a-half years to complete. Along the way she picked up the Fair Wind Foundation Scholarship and the Edith Winstone Blackwell Scholarship, and in 2015 was awarded the Interfaculty Sportswoman of the Year trophy for her involvement in “almost every interfaculty sport at some point”.

“I gravitated toward a Bachelor of Law and Property as they seemed to be a good fit for each other, and soon realised they would set me up really well,” Danielle, who attended Auckland Girls’ Grammar School, says.

“I have recently accepted a graduate role in a Property Law team next year, so both halves of my qualification will be put to good use. For the remainder of the year until I start my graduate role, I will be satisfying my love of the outdoors by getting involved in tree planting and community beach surf education.”

Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon says a university qualification has a lifetime impact on students, their families and the community at large.

 “Given that, compared to those who do not hold degrees, graduates can expect to have lower unemployment rates, higher salaries, better career prospects and better health, we are proud of the value that the University and our graduates add to their lives and to the wider community,” he says.
