For the upcoming concert and final round, each of the three outstanding musicians will perform in front of an audience of more than 1500 people in a bid to win the first prize of $6,000 as well as the chance to advance their solo careers.  
  
The total prize pool this year is $15,000, with second place receiving $4,000 and third $3,000. There is also an additional development prize of $2,000.

The winner will be chosen by a judging panel consisting of Associate Professor Helene Pohl, New Zealand School of Music, Victoria University of Wellington; Professor Terence Dennis, Co-ordinator of Classical Music Performance, University of Otago; and Associate Professor Martin Rummel, Head of School of Music, University of Auckland.

I am happy that the School of Music has been able to make such a significant contribution to the graduation festivities for ten years now and look forward to many more to come.”
