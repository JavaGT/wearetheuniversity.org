Trust boosts Auckland cancer research
=====================================

![Mr Liangren Li ](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2015/11/trust-boosts-auckland-cancer-research/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.img.jpg/1448838400368.jpg "Mr Liangren Li ")

Cancer research supporter, Mr Liangren Li.

The newly established Li Family Cancer Research Trust has announced its first call for applications for funding for cancer research projects, fellowships and doctoral scholarships.

Earlier this year Mr Liangren Li established a $10 million endowment fund with the University of Auckland to foster cancer research.

“The project funding is available to University of Auckland staff, but other cancer experts from outside the university including international researchers, can be included as collaborators,” says the Dean of the University’s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, Professor John Fraser.

The Trust’s funding is in three areas;

*   The Li Family Cancer Research Project Grant of $480,000 over three years is to provide financial support to an outstanding researcher whose scientific field has the potential to contribute to the treatment of cancer and carried out at the University of Auckland.
*   A $300,000 per year cancer research post-doctoral fellowship provides salary support for three years for an outstanding researcher to contribute to the treatment of cancer. The Li Family Cancer Research Fellowship aims to improve the understanding, diagnosis and outcomes for cancer treatment and is for research conducted at the University of Auckland.
*   Two Li Family PhD scholarships of $27,000 for three years each, open to domestic and international students to support two candidates completing a PhD degree in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences. The award aims to provide financial assistance to outstanding candidates whose programmes of study and research area have the potential to contribute to the treatment of cancer.
