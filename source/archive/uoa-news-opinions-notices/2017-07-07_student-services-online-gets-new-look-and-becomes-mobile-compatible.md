Check out the new look [Student Services Online](http://www.student.auckland.ac.nz/).

Student Services Online (SSO) has been upgraded, not only to make SSO look better but it will also become compatible over most mobile devices. The upgrade was completed today, Monday 14 August 2017.

*   In addition to SSO, the following are also available:
    *   Applications for Admissions (AFA)
    *   Scholarships
    *   Student Facing Transfer Credit
    *   College Scheduler
    *   ROT (Request for Official Transcript)
    *   Rank Score Calculator
*   When you sign in, SSO will look very different and will be easier to use on both a regular and touch screen
*   SSO is now compatible with most devices including smartphones, **with the exception of ‘Enrolment’**, which will not be accessible on smartphones. If you do try to enrol on a smartphone, the following message will appear:  
    _“Enrolment options are not available for phones. A tablet or PC will allow you to add classes to the cart and finalise your enrolment”_
*   Applying to graduate is not affected by the upgrade as the close off date is before the upgrade
*   Your timetables will still be available via Canvas
