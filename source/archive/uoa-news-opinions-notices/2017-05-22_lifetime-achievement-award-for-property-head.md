Professor Deborah Levy has received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) for her dedication to educating generations of property professionals.  
  
The award recognises eminent commitment to RICS and the wider profession and is the most prestigious award for built environment professionals in New Zealand.  
  
Professor Levy, Head of the Department of Property, accepted the accolade at the annual RICS Awards on 10 May.

RICS Managing Director for Oceania Stephen Albin said there was “little doubt” that Professor Levy has had a “profound impact” on the level of professionalism in the New Zealand market.  
  
In handing her the award, John Cameron, managing director PPCS Professional Property Consultancy Services, said Professor Levy arrived 31 years ago as young Bachelor of Land Economy graduate from the University of Aberdeen.  
  
She was on a three-year contract to lecture for the Bachelor of Property Administration at the University of Auckland.  
  
“The industry owes an enormous debt to Deborah and her team who have ‘fed’ us with more than 2000 extremely well-educated and rounded property graduates.  
  
These graduates probably exceed 2000 now serving our industry as true professionals,” said Cameron.

**Alumnus receives young achiever award**

Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Property conjoint graduate and part-time Property Lecturer Chris Farhi, now Director of Strategic Consulting at Colliers International, received the RICS Young Achiever Award.  
  
Judges said Farhi provided exemplary professional service to clients.  
  
“Chris typifies all that embodies a future professional leader. Last year he was awarded the Colliers International Professional Services Shield by his peers and has also been the NZ Defence Force reservist of the year.”
