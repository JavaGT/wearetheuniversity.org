NIHI research fellow, Dr Wilma Waterlander.

New Zealanders are being sought for a nation-wide study on food prices using novel online virtual supermarket software.

The study, called Price ExaM, is about supermarket food purchases and how food prices affect what people buy and is led by the National Institute for Health Innovation at the University of Auckland in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Otago.

“We are looking for 1000 adults living in New Zealand to take part in the Price ExaM study,” says study leader, Dr Wilma Waterlander from the University of Auckland.

“This will be the first large randomised trial using the Virtual Supermarket software,” she says. “Any adult (18 and over) can take part, as long as they have access to a computer and the internet, have an email address, do regular grocery shopping and no one else in their household is taking part.”

The entire study will be conducted online, so people throughout the country can join in.

Participants will be asked to complete five weekly household shops in the Virtual Supermarket and answer some questionnaires. Participants who complete the study will receive $40 in MTA (petrol and service station) vouchers.

“This is a landmark study” says Dr Waterlander. “It is the first time that we will have so many people conducting multiple shops in our Virtual Supermarket.”

“This approach is highly novel internationally and will provide us with unique insights on the importance of food prices during supermarket shopping.”

The Virtual Supermarket is an innovative software tool developed by Dr Waterlander and her team at the University.

Study participants can navigate the Virtual Supermarket with a shopping trolley, just like a real supermarket. The researchers track the foods people buy under different circumstances.  
The Virtual Supermarket was validated against real supermarket shops and has proved to be a valid tool to measure shopping behaviour.
