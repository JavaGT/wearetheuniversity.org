AUSA to raise money for Christchurch
====================================

AUSA has launched an immediate street appeal to raise money for the people of Christchurch affected by the disastrous earthquake.

"No words can express the horror of the scenes we have seen coming in from Christchurch," says AUSA President Joe McCory.

The street appeal is being coordinated by the students' association and will be running throughout AUSA Orientation next week and the University Orientation this week.

Anyone wishing to make a donation to the AUSA Appeal for Christchurch can contact AUSA or make a donation in person near the University quad and the Student Union builidng on the City Campus.

"Any University of Auckland students who wish to assist the association in organising the appeal are welcome to contact AUSA throughout the next few days.

"The thoughts of every University of Auckland student are with the people of Christchurch, their families and friends," said McCory.
