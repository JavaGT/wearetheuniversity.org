Emeritus Professor Ranginui Walker

The University of Auckland is saddened by the death of Emeritus Professor Ranginui Walker who died this morning at the age of 83.

Dr Walker was one of New Zealand’s most influential Māori academics. He studied at the University, gaining a Diploma of Teaching in 1962, a Bachelor of Arts in 1962 and a Master of Arts in 1966.

He was considered one of Māoridom’s most influential academic leaders and advocates for Māori rights and social justice.

Dr Walker was born on 1 March 1932 into a farming family belonging to the Whakatohea iwi of Opotiki.

He was educated at St Peter's Māori College in Auckland and trained first as a primary school teacher, working in that profession for 10 years.

In 1967 he took up a temporary lectureship in the Anthropology Department at the University where he completed his PhD in 1970.

He then served at the Centre for Continuing Education in Auckland for 15 years. During this time, he published numerous papers on Māori education and organised several Māori leadership conferences on urbanisation, gangs, Māori land, Māori fisheries, Māori educational development, and Māori representation in Parliament.

He was also a member of the National Advisory Committee on Māori Education (NACME) from 1980 to 1984 and was a member of the National and District Māori Council.

Dr Walker was appointed associate professor of Māori studies in the Anthropology Department at Auckland University in 1986. He served as professor of Māori Studies from 1993 to 1997 and Pro-Vice Chancellor (Māori) from 1996-1997.

Besides his numerous papers and chapters in books, Dr Walker published six books: _Nga Tau Tohetohe: The Years of Anger_ (1987), _Ka Whawahi Tonu Matou: Struggle without End_ (1990), _Nga Pepa a Ranginui: The Walker Papers_ (1997), _He Tipua: The Life and Times of Sir Apirana Ngata_ (2001), _Opotiki Mai Tawhiti_ (2007), and _Paki Harrison: Tohunga Whakairo. The story of a master carver_ (2008).

Dr Walker was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2001 New Year honours list, and in 2007 he was awarded the Te Tohu o te Māramatanga research excellence award, Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga (CORE) University of Auckland. In 2009, Professor Walker was awarded a Prime Minister's Literary Award and in 2012 he received a Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Auckland.

Dr Walker was appointed to the Waitangi Tribunal in 2003.

The University made Dr Walker a Distinguished Alumni in 2012.

University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says Dr Walker continued to serve the University in many ways. He chaired review panels, he supported and advised staff and remained keenly interested in the affairs of the University.

“We mourn the loss of a distinguished Māori academic and longstanding member of the University. The University sends their deepest condolences to his wife Deidre, son Professor Michael Walker and whānau pani.”

The University’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Māori), Jim Peters, said Dr Walker was a lead thinker in the development of Māori consciousness in the Twentieth Century.

“He generously shared his knowledge with all. He was very aware of the need for whanau and intergenerational achievement and sought to place Māori within the social and environmental future of Aotearoa.”

Associate Professor Tracey McIntosh of the University’s Centre of Research Excellence, said herself and Dr Walker’s other colleagues were in deep mourning.

“The shock of it this morning was profound. His intellectual labour has provided for so many of us the foundation of our work.”

Dr McIntosh said Dr Walker spoke to many audiences through his academic research and his columns in Metro and the Listener magazines that “added his distinctive voice to the nation.”

Dr McIntosh said Dr Walker was not a fan of “gilding the lily.”

“This was a man who was shy by nature but was driven by the need to ensure there was justice and understanding.”
