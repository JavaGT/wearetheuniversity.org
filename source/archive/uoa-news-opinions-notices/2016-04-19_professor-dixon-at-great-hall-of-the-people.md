Professor Dixon travelled to Beijing to join the 40 strong trade mission lead by Prime Minister Key.

The University Memorandum of Understanding strengthens the NZ Centre at Peking University relationships and reflects the importance of the Centre to New Zealand and its Chinese university partner.

Professor Dixon, Peking University President Lin Jianhua and Victoria University of Wellington Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford signed the MOU.

New Zealand Centre Advisory Board chair Professor Jenny Dixon says the signing is a significant milestone for the Centre.

"The New Zealand Centre is a unique partnership between one of China’s most prestigious universities and New Zealand’s academics and researchers," she says. "It promotes the study of New Zealand in China and contributes to the strengthening of the deep relationship between China and New Zealand."

The Centre offers an undergraduate elective course on New Zealand, which is taught in English, facilitates exchanges of researchers between PKU and New Zealand universities, and provides a forum for policy dialogue. An annual summer school is held in New Zealand for PKU students.

The Centre was initially established by the University of Auckland in 2007 and joined soon after by four other New Zealand universities: the University of Otago, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Waikato and the University of Canterbury. Massey University, AUT and Lincoln University joined later.

The Centre is also supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Education NZ.
