![The Professional Practice of Teaching in New Zealand ](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2015/10/popular-book-has-guided-teachers-for-two-decades/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.img.jpg/1454445168445.jpg "The Professional Practice of Teaching in New Zealand ")

A popular book that has guided New Zealand teachers for over two decades has just published its fifth edition thanks to the work of several University of Auckland academics.

_The Professional Practice of Teaching in New Zealand_ has been published for 21 years. The latest fifth edition is co-edited by Associate Professor Mary Hill of the school of Learning, Development and Professional Practice in the Faculty of Education and Social Work, alongside Professor Deborah Fraser of the University of Waikato.

This is the first time Associate Professor Hill has co-edited the book, having taken over from Emeritus Professor Clive McGee of the University of Waikato, who had co-edited the previous four editions.

“It was a wonderful experience to both co-edit and contribute to such a wonderful book,” she says.

“It’s a book I have used myself as a teacher educator, and I know it will assist student teachers during their teacher education, and once they are qualified and in front of a class.”

Several of the book chapters are written by Faculty of Education and Social Work academics from the school of Learning, Development and Professional Practice and the Dean, Professor Graeme Aitken.

Dr Claire Sinnema and Professor Aitken wrote chapter 4, “Teaching as Inquiry” in which they discuss the importance of continuous examination of how teachers’ actions and behaviour impact on the learning experience of students.

Professor Christine Rubie-Davies, Senior Lecturer Lyn McDonald,

Lecturer Annaline Flint combined to write chapter 7, “Planning with high expectations” which outlines how planning is critical to student learning.

And Associate Professor Hill wrote chapter 8, “Using classroom assessment for effective learning and teaching” that describes how assessment is a critical aspect of learning and teaching in every classroom and at any level of learning.

All of the book’s chapters conclude with suggested activities that could form the basis for tutorial work for teacher educators to use in the classroom.

The book has just been published. You can [read more about it and order a copy](https://cengage.com.au/product/division/university/title/the-professional-practice-of-teaching-in-new/isbn/9780170350716).
