Nominations open for 2016 Blues Awards
======================================

01 July 2016

![Blues-Awards-2015](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2016/07/blues-awards/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.img.jpg/1467322924364.jpg "Blues-Awards-2015")

Staff can nominate students who have had outstanding success in Sport, Arts or Service and Leadership between 1 January 2015 and 29 July 2016 for a Blues award.

Students can self-nominate but achieving highly in other fields alongside academia can sometimes make this difficult. So help the University recognise their excellence by nominating the amazing students you know.

The Blues originate from Oxford and Cambridge University and has recognised students such as Olympic-bound Eliza McCartney and alumni Elinor Swery, a Divisional Manager with St Johnâ€˜s.

Check out the [Blues webpage](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/for/current-students/cs-life-at-auckland/blues-awards.html) for more details. Nominations close 29 July 2016.

Contact Gemma Skipper on [blues@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:blues@auckland.ac.nz) or 923 8017 with any queries.
