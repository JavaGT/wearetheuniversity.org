A rich diversity among those who play father and father-figure roles in the lives of contemporary New Zealand children was revealed in new research from the University of Auckland’s Centre for Longitudinal Research.

The research drew on responses from the fathers and co-parents of children who are being followed in the University-based longitudinal study Growing Up in New Zealand.

“The diversity of ‘dads’ in the study reflected some of the ethnic diversity of 21st century New Zealand and included a reported 77 different combinations of ethnicity together with a high proportion (more than 30 percent) of ‘migrant dads’ who were born outside New Zealand,” says study principal investigator and Growing Up in New Zealand study director, Professor Susan Morton from the University of Auckland.

“The study shows not only the changing face of today’s dads, but their changing roles in children’s lives,” says Dr Morton.

The research explored the diversity of individuals who are father figures with a focus on work, parenting, family and how involved fathers and co-parents are with their child.

Study participants included not only biological fathers but also stepfathers, adoptive and foster parents, co-mums, grandparents and other family members.

The study, funded by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE), is based on more than 4,000 responses to an online questionnaire sent to fathers and others who fill a ‘dad role’ to the Growing Up in New Zealand children (who were aged around six years at the time).

The research revealed that 90 percent of participants grew up with a father or father-figure.  
“For more than 80 percent of respondents this was their biological father while for others the role was filled by step, adoptive or foster parents, other family and non-family members,” says Dr Morton.

“This suggests that there was considerable diversity amongst those who were father figures to the previous generation as they were growing up,” she says. “This study presents a snapshot of the situation when the children are six, and we expect that this will continue to evolve as they grow up and family relationships change.

“The longitudinal nature of Growing Up in New Zealand gives us the capacity to track these changes and their impact on child wellbeing and development,” says Professor Morton.

The 73 percent of participants who grew up with a father or father figure said that, compared with that relationship, they were more involved with their children.

Growing Up in New Zealand (GUINZ) is a longitudinal study tracking the development of approximately 7,000 New Zealand children who were born in 2009-2010 from before birth until they are young adults.

The study has collected detailed multidisciplinary information about children’s early development and reflects the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of today’s primary school age children.

Growing Up in New Zealand is University of Auckland-led research and funded by the Crown. The government contract for the study is managed by the Social Policy and Evaluation Research Unit (Superu).
