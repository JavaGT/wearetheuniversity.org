Sendai earthquake and tsunami – Vice-Chancellor‘s message to students
=====================================================================

I am writing on behalf of the Council, staff and students of the University to express our concern and support following the earthquake and tsunami centred on Sendai. Coming so soon after the Christchurch earthquake, this is an event that unites our two countries in grieving for those who have lost family members, homes and communities.

We are concerned to ensure that you are given all the support possible during this very difficult time. Counsellors are on standby in our Halls of Residence for any students who need support and counselling. You can also contact University Counselling Services.

If there is anything we can do to assist you, please contact Rebecca Walkinton in the International Student Information Centre on +64 (0)9 373 7599 ext 86911 or at [r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz).
