Charting NZ’s co-op landscape

Fonterra is lead sponsor for the report on New Zealand's cooperative economy

Ask the person next to you and chances are they can rattle off the names of two or three New Zealand cooperatives. But, ask what cooperatives offer New Zealand, and you might have them stumped.

Cooperatives are member-owned organisations, meaning that the users of the cooperative are also the shareholders in the organisation. Most people’s knowledge stops about here, but a new project about the contribution cooperatives make to our economy is expected to reveal there is much more to them than many of us realise.

Researchers from the University of Auckland are joining forces with colleagues at Massey University and the sector body, Cooperative Business New Zealand, to produce the first ever comprehensive analysis of the cooperative economy.

The report, due out in December, will synthesise data from three years of surveys and case studies from both universities, as well as fresh data collected about the top 30 New Zealand cooperatives.

Researchers say the _Co-operative Economy of New Zealand_ report will provide accurate facts and figures about what co-ops contribute to the country, which goes beyond dollars and cents.

“Within the sector, organisations are aware of some of the real social and economic value co-ops provide their members and their communities,” says researcher Dr Lisa Callagher, senior lecturer in Management and International Business at the University of Auckland.

Examples were highlighted at Cooperative Business New Zealand’s annual awards dinner earlier this month, she says.

Co-operative Leader of the Year Mark McHardy, general manager of Farmlands Fuel, was recognised with an award not only for leveraging that co-op’s collective buying power and for its health and safety record, but also for bringing Super Rugby back to grassroots with pre-season trainings and matches hosted on paddocks owned by one of Farmlands’ shareholders.

Phil McKendry, chairman of Ashburton Trading Society, received the Outstanding Co-operative Contribution award for years of championing both the commercial and social interests of the society’s members.

“Our own case studies highlight some exemplary practices around governance training, and support for innovation,” says Dr Callagher.

“What this report will do is move beyond anecdote and case studies to identify strengths and needs across co-ops, and inform key stakeholders about the nature, extent and importance of co-ops in NZ. It will also create a benchmark method for monitoring cooperatives’ ongoing contribution.”

The study is being funded by Fonterra (lead sponsor), Ballance Agri-Nutrients, CDC Pharmaceuticals, Co-op Money NZ, Farmlands, Farmers Mutual Group, Foodstuffs – South Island, Market Gardeners, Mitre 10, Ravensdown and Silver Fern Farms.
