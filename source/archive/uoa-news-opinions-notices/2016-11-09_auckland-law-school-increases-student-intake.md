Auckland Law School increases student intake
============================================

09 November 2016

More high-achieving school leavers will be able to pursue law in Auckland following the decision by the University of Auckland Council to increase its undergraduate intake.  

From 2017, the Auckland Law School at the University of Auckland will make available an additional 50 places, increasing Part II numbers from 330 to 380 students, with potentially more places after that.   

Dean of Law, Professor Andrew Stockley says: “The Auckland Law School’s Part II student intake has not increased for over a decade, while at the same time Auckland’s population has significantly expanded. These changes will address this.  

“The increase in undergraduate student numbers will provide more opportunities for academically gifted students who want to study at New Zealand’s leading university to pursue a law degree,” he says.  
  
The increase will also allow for more places under the Targeted Admissions Scheme. Helping support more Māori and Pacific students is important to provide a more representative legal profession.  
  
The Auckland Law School, which will continue to have the highest admission standards in the country, will significantly increase its number of full-time academic staff at the same time. This will allow it to provide more small group and innovative teaching and will make the number of full-time academic staff more comparable to higher-ranked law schools such as Melbourne and Sydney. Auckland is the only New Zealand law school ranked among the top 50 in the world and this will help it become even higher ranked.  

“With significantly more staff, the Auckland Law School will have a much larger research footprint, which is critical for increased international attention, impact and rankings. More staff will also help ensure that the Auckland Law School is a truly comprehensive law school, with strength in all major areas,” adds Professor Stockley.    

As part of the additional resources, the School will also benefit from up to an additional 900 square metres of space.
