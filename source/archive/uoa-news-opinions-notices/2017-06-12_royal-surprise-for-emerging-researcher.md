The Royal Geographical Society in London has recognised a University of Auckland PhD student as a leading new researcher in the field of geography.

Brendon Blue, a doctoral student in the School of Environment in the Faculty of Science, received his accolade in person at the Society’s Kensington headquarters on Monday.

He received the Wiley Publisher’s Area Prize for New Research in Geography, for the best article in the journal by a new researcher.

“I receive the Area Prize with real surprise and delight. I would like to thank my colleagues in geography at the University of Auckland for encouraging and supporting my diverse and interdisciplinary interests,” Brendon says. He also thanked the journal’s editors.

The Royal Geographical Society’s medals and awards recognise extraordinary achievement in geographical research, fieldwork and teaching, photography and public engagement.

Brendon was among 17 people to receive awards at a celebration which followed the Society’s Annual General Meeting.

Brendon’s paper, titled “But what do you measure? Prospects for a constructive critical physical geography”, explored possibilities for more socially-sensitive river science and management.

The Society said of Brendon’s article: “This is an excellent agenda-setting paper that explores how geomorphic knowledge is manufactured and mobilised. Using the example of river diversity and measurement, it makes the case for a ‘constructive critical physical geography’ that develops rigorous, place-based and democratic understandings of landscapes.”

Founded in 1830, the Royal Geographical Society is dedicated to the development and promotion of geographical knowledge, together with its application to the challenges facing society and the environment.
