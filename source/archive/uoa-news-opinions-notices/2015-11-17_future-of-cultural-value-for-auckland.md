As Associate Dean for Creativity, Jonothan Neelands is Professor of Creative Education at the Warwick Business School  and Chair of Drama and Theatre Education at the University of Warwick.

He is working with colleagues to integrate creative activities  into the curriculum and the extra-curricular life of the School, such as student performances and participatory theatre workshops that use classical literature to explore the human questions and issues at the heart of all businesses.

Professor Neelands’ recent research has included working in partnership with the Department for Education, Higher Education Academy for the Open Space Learning project at Warwick; the Birmingham Royal Ballet; Birmingham Repertory Theatre; the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Association of Youth Theatres.
