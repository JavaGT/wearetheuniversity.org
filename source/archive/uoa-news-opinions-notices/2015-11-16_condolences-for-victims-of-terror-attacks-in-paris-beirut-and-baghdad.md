Condolences for victims of terror attacks in Paris, Beirut and Baghdad
======================================================================

On behalf of the University of Auckland I express our deepest sympathy to the people of France and those who lost their loved ones following the heinous attacks in Paris on Friday. Our thoughts are also with the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attacks in Beirut and Baghdad.  

Any students requiring help or support should contact Rebecca Walkinton, Associate Director, Student Support Services, Auckland International, 373 7599 ext 86911, email [r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz)

We have a number of students in France and our team moved quickly once we had word of the attacks to establish that all members of the University known to be in Paris were safe.

For the latest advice for New Zealanders abroad and the number to call if you have concerns about a family member overseas, please see the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s website [SafeTravel](https://safetravel.govt.nz/news/france-attacks-paris).
