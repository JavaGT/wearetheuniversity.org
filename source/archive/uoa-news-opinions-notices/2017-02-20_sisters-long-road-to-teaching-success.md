Sisters’ long road to teaching success

Sisters Michelle Harden and Angela Brewer

Two sisters supported each other through the long commute from Kerikeri to Whangarei so they could study to become primary school teachers.

Angela Brewer and Michelle Harden’s efforts paid on Friday when they both graduated with Bachelor of Education (Primary) degrees from the University of Auckland’s Tai Tokerau Campus.

Angela, 38, and Michelle, 32, decided to become teachers after previous careers. Angela worked in photography and design, and Michelle was a hairdresser.

After Angela had a baby, and Michelle had three children they both became stay-at-home mums before deciding to return to study.

“Some of my best memories stem from my own primary school days. I believe the education is the most powerful way to promote positive change in our society and I was really excited and motivated to be a part of that,” Michelle said.Angela was inspired by the birth of her son in 2008.

“When my eldest child was born he became my inspiration. Watching his learning journey evolve ignited my passion for teaching and learning. When he was two I began my journey towards becoming a qualified teacher,” Angela said.

Both sisters had their study interrupted by the birth of another child. For Angela, it was her second, and for Michelle, her fourth.

They both returned to study for their degrees part time, Michelle initially studied in Auckland before joining Angela in Kerikeri in 2015.

They commuted to the Faculty of Education and Social Work’s Tai Tokerau Campus on the days they had lectures.

“It was well worth the travel down from Kerikeri,” Angela said.

“We spent two hours a day commuting to Whangarei when we digested and discussed our learning.”

They enjoyed the supportive atmosphere at Tai Tokerau.

“I found it to be an extremely supportive environment where everyone knows each other. I think being a smaller campus helped create this encouraging supportive culture. The staff have an excellent quality of expertise and are really friendly,” Angela said.

The sisters are particularly grateful to staff Judy Taingahue and Lindsay Laing for their help and support.

Both sisters were supported by their family and friends at graduation.

Michelle is now teaching Year 0-2 at Oromahoe School, and Angela teaches years 2 and 3 at the Bay of Islands International Academy.

“Teaching is like no other job. There is nothing quite like the knowledge that you are making a positive difference in the lives of others. I love working and collaborating with other visionary teachers and have learnt so much from our supportive team.

“I would definitely recommend teaching to anyone who realises just how precious our tamariki are, they are our future,” Angela said.

Michelle agrees. “Teaching so far is super busy, but already so rewarding. I'm absolutely loving it.”
