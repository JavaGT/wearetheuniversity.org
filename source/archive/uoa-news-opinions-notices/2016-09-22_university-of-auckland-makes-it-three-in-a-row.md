University of Auckland makes it three in a row
==============================================

22 September 2016

The University of Auckland is again ranked as the leading university in New Zealand in the 2016-17 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.

The University was placed joint 165th out of 980 international institutions, up from 172nd last year.

The University is the only New Zealand University to feature in the top 200, and to be among the top eight universities in Oceania.

Earlier this month, the University was 81st the QS World University Rankings, the only New Zealand university to be ranked in the top 100.

The University was also ranked as the most innovative in New Zealand and Australia in the inaugural Reuters Top 75: Asia’s Most Innovative Universities rankings in August. Auckland was placed 27th, ahead of the leading Australian universities. No other New Zealand university featured in the top 75.

“We are pleased with these results over the course of this year and we do think that the high rankings internationally are something the country as a whole can be proud of,” Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon

“Our efforts will continue to be focused on achieving excellence in all that we do, including a focus on the University’s strengths in research and the very high quality education that we offer to New Zealanders.”

The Times Higher Education ranking is based on indicators taken across five sectors including teaching, research, citations, international outlook and industry income.
