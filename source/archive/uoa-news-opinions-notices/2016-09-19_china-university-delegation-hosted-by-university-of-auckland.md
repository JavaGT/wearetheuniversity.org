Delegates from Tsinghua and Qinghai Universities will visit the University of Auckland today for high-level discussions on how on-going collaboration between the three universities can be strengthened and enhanced.

One of the purposes of the visit is to continue discussions on a trilateral partnership to develop new collaborative projects in science and engineering, and to highlight the research strengths of the University of Auckland’s Faculties of Science and Engineering.

Tsinghua Chairperson Professor Chen Xu and President of Qinghai University Professor Wang Guangqian are both part of the delegation. Steven Joyce, the Minister for Innovation, Business and Employment, will also meet the visitors.

Vice-Chancellor of the University of Auckland, Professor Stuart McCutcheon, warmly welcomed members of the delegation to New Zealand and the University.

“We strongly value our close relationship with both Tsinghua and Qinghai Universities, a collaboration we see as having real potential benefits for both China and New Zealand’s future,” he said.

“All three universities are focused on excellence in research and innovation and we have much to share with, and to gain from, each other.”

Professor Wei Gao from the University of Auckland’s Faculty of Engineering said Tsinghua University was the number one science and engineering university in China, and the relationship between the three universities was a close one.

"The international connections and collaborations that will result from this relationship with Tsinghua and Qinghai universities are beneficial for all parties, and for New Zealand as a whole,” he said.

“Our partnership with Tsinghua University is also about supporting the on-going development and success of Qinghai University and is an excellent example of how international collaboration can work for the benefit of all parties.”

The delegation will also meet with Associate Professor Jacqueline Beggs from the University of Auckland’s School of Biological Sciences and other representatives from the Centre for Biosecurity and Biodiversity National Science Challenge.
