Launch of new Programme pages
=============================

We are excited to announce more than 160 newly designed academic programme pages have been launched. This is a major step forward in improving prospective student's experience when deciding which programmes of study they will pursue here at the University of Auckland.

Previously, information about programmes, entry requirements, fees and dates were held in multiple locations which made it difficult for students to find. Often the information was duplicated between the faculty and University websites meaning it could be sometimes be outdated and inconsistent.   The new programme pages have been developed to bring all key information into one place, creating a single source of the truth that students can trust.

The new academic programme pages offer students a one-stop-shop to see:

*   an overview of the programme
*   quick facts about the duration, locations and points
*   programme structure
*   subjects
*   entry requirements
*   key dates
*   fees
*   career opportunities
*   further study options
*   stories from graduates of the programme

Take a look at the new academic [programme pages](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/study-options/find-a-study-option.html).
