Guaranteed postgraduate scholarships a first in New Zealand
===========================================================

06 October 2015

_More scholarships, more money for high-achieving postgraduate research students_

From 1 October, the University of Auckland began offering guaranteed scholarships to high-achieving domestic postgraduate research students.

The number of doctoral scholarships on offer has also increased significantly, from 138 to 200 new scholarships each year. This is being funded through savings in university administrative costs.

Postgraduate research students with a grade point average (GPA) of 8.0 or higher from any New Zealand university - effectively ‘straight-A students’ - will automatically receive a scholarship.

Māori and Pacific students require a GPA of 7.5 or higher under the new scheme, in line with the University’s commitment to enhance the participation and success of Māori and Pacific students.

The University’s guaranteed doctoral scholarships scheme is one of the most generous in New Zealand. Doctoral stipends increase from $25,000 to $27,000 per year, and sub-doctoral stipends from $10,000 to $13,000. The University will also cover students’ tuition fees in full.

The application process is simpler as students are no longer required to complete a separate application for centrally funded postgraduate scholarships.

“We are the only university in New Zealand to offer scholarships to postgraduate diploma and honours students as well as masters students; and we offer more doctoral scholarships than any other university,” University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says.

“In recognition of the high calibre of our students, we now have the highest-value doctoral scholarships in the country and a streamlined awarding process.

“This scheme recognises the importance of attracting high-achieving students into postgraduate programmes, and the development of specialised skills and expertise, which ultimately benefits New Zealand’s economy and knowledge base.”

The guaranteed scholarships will be offered alongside places in a programme, doing away with scholarships ‘rounds’.

The University expects the 200 doctoral scholarships on offer will be enough for every eligible applicant.

High-achieving international students will continue to be considered for doctoral scholarships, but will not be eligible for guaranteed scholarships. As universities’ grading systems vary considerably outside New Zealand, students’ grades from overseas qualifying programmes will be converted into a University of Auckland equivalent to establish whether the student meets the required academic criteria.
