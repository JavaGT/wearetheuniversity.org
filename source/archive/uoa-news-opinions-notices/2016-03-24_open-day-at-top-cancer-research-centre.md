Open Day at top cancer research centre
======================================

24 March 2016

![ACSRC 60thAnniversary EventPage](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-events-and-notices/news/news-2016/03/open-day-at-top-cancer-research-centre/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.img.jpg/1458781880544.jpg "ACSRC 60thAnniversary EventPage")

The lab doors at Auckland’s world renowned cancer research centre will be opened to supporters and the public on Saturday \[April 9\] for an inspiring and interactive Open Day.

Researchers at the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre (ACSRC), based at the University of Auckland, have punched above their weight for decades. Despite being a small research centre, they have made many globally significant discoveries.

ACSRC scientists have launched 12 drugs into clinical trials and have more on the way and are global leaders in three areas of cancer research – pro-drugs activated by hypoxia (low-oxygen) in tumours, immune modulation, and molecular targeting.

For its 60th Anniversary celebrations, the Centre is giving the public the opportunity to see what this world class research lab is doing to help conquer cancer.

The Open Day will have engaging activities from 9.30am to 3pm that include: TED-style talks and the chance to ask questions (starts at 10am); Tours of the ACSRC (need to wear closed shoes and book on the day); and an InfoHub that showcases the ACSRC’s amazing six-decade history.

The TED-style short talks will give a glimpse into the world of the top researchers and what they are doing to battle cancer. There will be five minutes after each talk for the public to ask questions.

More than a dozen talks will be offered, including: Unleashing the Immune System to Defeat Cancer; Powerful Molecules: Chemical Warfare to Chemotherapy; and Past, Present and Future: Grand Challenges Facing the Next Generation of Cancer Researchers.  

Tours of the ACSRC will run concurrently to the TED-style talks from 10am til 3pm and last about 20 to 30 minutes each.  On the tour, the public can see what cancer cells look like and hear how ACSRC researchers are battling them. Tours will include visits to: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Chemical, Tissue Culture, Molecular Biological, and Drug Screening areas.

Visitors need to book a place on a tour and wear ‘closed shoes’ on the tours, where heels and toes are covered. No alcohol is allowed on site and the University Campus is ‘Smoke Free’.

The ‘Conquering Cancer’ Infohub is a chance to chat with cancer researchers and have a look at an exciting range of information about cancer and what the ACSRC is doing in the battle against it.

The Open Day is at the University’s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, at 85 Park Road, Grafton and more information about what is happening on the day [is available at this link.](http://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/conquering-cancer)
