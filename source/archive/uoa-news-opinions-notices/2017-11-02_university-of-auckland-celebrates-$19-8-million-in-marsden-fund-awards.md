University of Auckland celebrates $19.8 million in Marsden Fund awards
======================================================================

02 November 2017

The University of Auckland is celebrating the success of 31 of its researchers and research groups whose projects have won $19.8 million in the Marsden Fund round.

Research at the University supported by the fund will address diverse topics including the origins of early life on earth; defending blood flow to the ‘selfish’ brain; a Māori archaeology of threatened rock art; building an ‘atlas’ of the human gut; and the impact of marketing ‘health’ to children.

“These awards recognise the high calibre of researchers at the University of Auckland as well as the quality and breadth of our research,” says Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Jim Metson.

“The Marsden Fund supports the cutting-edge of new research which will lead to discoveries that shape our future. We congratulate our researchers for this recognition of their outstanding work.”

Thirteen research projects from the Faculty of Science received a total of $8.8 million. Among these, Professor Kathleen Campbell will carry out research to find early life in terrestrial hot springs.

Seven projects from the Faculty of Arts were awarded a total of $4.6 million. These include Dr Alice Mills who will study the role of stable housing in reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners. Dr Avril Bell will pursue research titled ‘Tāngata Tiriti: Learning the trick of standing upright here’.

Grants of $3 million were awarded to four research projects from the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, including Dr Fiona McBryde who will investigate a pioneering technique measuring the dynamic relationship between blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity and brain blood flow.

Grants worth a total of $1.5 million were awarded to three projects from the Faculty of Engineering, including for Dr Lihua Tang, for research into self-adaptive technologies to harvest electricity from environmental vibrations. Dr Xuyun Zhang will study versatile and efficient anomaly detection for fog computing applications.

The Auckland Bioengineering Institute was awarded two grants totalling $1.25 million, including for research by Associate Professor Leo Cheng titled: ‘An atlas of the gut: a framework for integrating structure to function’.

The Faculty of Education and Social Work and the James Henare Research Centre each won a grant of $300,000.

Applications to the Marsden Fund are highly competitive. This year the fund distributed $84.6 million to 133 research projects around the country.

Successful projects from the University of Auckland are:
