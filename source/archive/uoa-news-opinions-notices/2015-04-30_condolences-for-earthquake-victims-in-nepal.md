Condolences for earthquake victims in Nepal
===========================================

On behalf of the University of Auckland and on my own behalf, I extend our deepest sympathy to the people of Nepal following the catastrophic 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck their country. In particular our thoughts and prayers are with Nepalese students at our University whose families, friends and acquaintances have suffered in the earthquake.

Any Nepalese students requiring help should contact Rebecca Walkinton, Associate Director, Student Support Services, International Office, 373 7599 ext 86911, email [r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:r.walkinton@auckland.ac.nz)

Donations can be made to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which is preparing to mount an emergency response operation: [Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/around-the-world/stories/red-cross-in-action-following-earthquake-in-nepal/), or to the New Zealand Nepal Society which is running a charity fundraising campaign to support the victims and survivors of the earthquake: [New Zealand Nepal Society](http://www.nznepalsociety.co.nz/nzns/)
