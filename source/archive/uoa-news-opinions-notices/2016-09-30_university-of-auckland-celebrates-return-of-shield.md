University of Auckland celebrates return of Shield
==================================================

University of Auckland Sports Manager Albie Eaton and Sports Officer Tracey Spray receive the University & Tertiary Sport New Zealand (UTSNZ) Shield.

The University of Auckland is officially the highest point scorer in sporting tournaments in 2016 and has claimed the coveted ‘Shield’.

Continuing a 93-year-old tradition, the University was awarded the University & Tertiary Sport New Zealand (UTSNZ) Shield at the weekend. 

The ‘Shield’, as it is known amongst students, elicits fierce rivalry among universities.

It is presented to the tertiary provider with the greatest combined points from UTSNZ sporting events and championships held throughout the year.

A celebratory parade will be held at the University of Auckland on Friday 14 October, when students will have the opportunity to have their photo taken with the Shield.

Plans have also begun for the Shield to go on a nationwide tour of New Zealand universities later this year.

The Shield was particularly sought after this year as it has not been awarded for the past five years, since Student Union membership became voluntary and the viability of inter-tertiary sporting tournaments declined.

The Shield was reinstated by the new University and Tertiary Sport New Zealand body this year.

UTSNZ was set up in 2016 by New Zealand University Vice-Chancellors to re-establish competitive sport pathways and inter-tertiary competition for student athletes.

 “The University is very proud of our students’ preparation, commitment and determination to win back the Shield in this new format inter-tertiary sporting competition,” says University of Auckland Director of Sport Louis Rattray.

“The standard of competition throughout has been excellent and shows students and universities value the new competitive format being provided by UTSNZ. I would like to thank UTSNZ and the national and regional sporting bodies who have helped make this year’s tournament a success.”

The holder of the 2016 shield was decided after the final two championships, hockey and netball, were held in Wellington and Auckland respectively last weekend.

The University of Auckland was presented with the shield at the conclusion of the National Tertiary Netball Championships, held at the Auckland Netball Centre, when a final tally of points could be calculated.
