The University was closed on Thursday due to forecast adverse weather
=====================================================================

The University was closed on Thursday 13 April 2017 due to the forecast of adverse weather. This decision was made to ensure the safety of staff and students in light of information at the time.

We encouraged everyone to follow the official advice from Civil Defence and monitor Met Service information. Take care everyone and stay safe.

All lectures, tutorials, labs and other teaching events were cancelled from 11am. Tests scheduled for Thursday were also cancelled. If students were due to submit course work on Thursday, please do so electronically. If you cannot submit electronically please contact your Course Coordinator. Please monitor CANVAS for course updates. Further advice will be provided next week on rescheduling of tests.

We are communicating directly with staff and students. 

*   For student inquiries please email [studentinfo@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:studentinfo@auckland.ac.nz)
*   For international students who have any concerns, please contact Rebecca Walkinton, International Student Services +64 21 376 922

All staff and students were urged to monitor weather and transport information, and leave the campuses. If staff needed special access to research facilities they needed the permission of their Academic Head.      

If staff have any questions related to the closure please email the Staff Service Centre [staffservice@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:staffservice@auckland.ac.nz).

Please note all our Contact Centres will be closed for phone calls. 

### When will the University re-open?

Due to the slow moving nature of the weather event the University will remain closed to all staff and students until a full safety assessment has been completed. All buildings are being cleared, checked and locked. We anticipate being able to give an update late Friday afternoon. 

All updates will be posted on the website, this update will include the Library, Information Commons and Recreation Centre opening hours.

### Is the Tamaki Shuttle operational?

The shuttle will still be operating during normal hours all day today (13 April).

### Can I complete my work today and stay in my building?

No, all staff and students have been directed as a safety precaution to evacuate all buildings on all campuses and all research centres.

### If I have a test or assignment due, what do I need to do?

There will be notification of all rescheduled test or assignments. We will notify you when the University reopens on Wednesday after the Easter break.
