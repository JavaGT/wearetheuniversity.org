Changes to Unsatisfactory Progress Regulations
==============================================

The Unsatisfactory Progress Regulations (USP) have been replaced with the requirements for maintaining Good Academic Standing.  
  
Academic Standing is a new way of calculating academic progress for undergraduate students. To maintain Good Academic Standing, students need to pass at least 50% of points enrolled in for each semester (including Summer School). Students who donâ€™t pass at least half the points they are enrolled in will have their Academic Standing amended and may have conditions or restrictions applied to their enrolment in the next semester.
