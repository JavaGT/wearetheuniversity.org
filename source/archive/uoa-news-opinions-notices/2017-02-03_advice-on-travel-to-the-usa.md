On January 27, the U.S.A. suspended visa issuance to nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen. All University of Auckland staff and students holding passports from these countries should verify their entry eligibility before confirming their travel to the U.S.A. and consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) website. Our travel provider has already advised those with upcoming bookings to the U.S.A.

International collaboration is at the heart of all world-class universities and key to our own mission and values. We acknowledge and support the efforts of our friends and academic partners in the U.S.A. in their advocacy for the benefits of international collaboration. The University of Auckland continues to strongly affirm and support the international endeavours of our students and staff as they pursue their educational goals.
