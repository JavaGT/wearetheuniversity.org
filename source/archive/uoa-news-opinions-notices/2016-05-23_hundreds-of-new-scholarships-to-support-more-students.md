Hundreds of new scholarships to support more students
=====================================================

23 May 2016

Hundreds of new undergraduate scholarships will be provided by the University of Auckland to help entry-level students transition into university life.

The University of Auckland has opened applications for four brand-new scholarship types which will be awarded to more than 400 students starting undergraduate studies in 2017 including;

*   University of Auckland Top Achiever Scholarships – value $20,000
*   University of Auckland Māori Academic Excellence Scholarships – value $20,000
*   University of Auckland Pacific Academic Excellence Scholarships – value $20,000
*   University of Auckland Academic Potential Scholarships – value up to $20,000

The University of Auckland will have many more scholarships available for students to apply for than any other New Zealand university.

“Our focus in designing the new schemes and increasing the number of scholarships available has been on empowering students from schools across New Zealand to successfully transition into their first year at the University,” says University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

This all adds up to a much more extensive offering of University-funded scholarships — school-leavers will be awarded more than $8.3 million in 2017.

Guaranteed accommodation in a University hall of residence is a major component of the new scholarships. The accommodation package includes pastoral care, social activities, and membership of the University Recreation Centre and, for first year students, three meals per day.

Living in the academically supportive environment of a hall of residence in a student’s first year has been shown to improve study outcomes.

Auckland-based students wishing to live away from the family home, as well as students from elsewhere in New Zealand, will now be able to experience living in the central city, in a safe environment, with student services on hand and the opportunity to build lasting and supportive peer-group networks.

Living close to the University will ease the burden of travel time and costs for those who would otherwise be commuting and help incoming students get the most out of University life and opportunities.

In addition to students’ personal and academic achievements, we will assess a broad range of circumstances when we consider students for a scholarship.

Our assessment criteria include whether an individual is the first in their family to attend university; is from a refugee background; has a disability; is living in a rural area; or is experiencing financial hardship.

Students currently enrolled in University pathway programmes will also be eligible to apply for the new University of Auckland Academic Potential Scholarship.

“Our strategy of achieving equity goals by increasing the diversity of our student population, and attracting a broad range of talented students to a safe, inclusive and equitable institution, is fundamental to the University’s decision to expand the reach of our new scholarships,” says Professor McCutcheon.

The application process for the new scholarships will also be simpler for students and schools.

“We have listened to feedback from students and schools and made changes to the scholarship application and assessment process. Our new approach will add more objectivity and consistency to our decision-making process,” says Professor McCutcheon.

Applications for these scholarships close on 23 August 2016. We anticipate that awardees will continue to be drawn from secondary schools across New Zealand. All eligible students are encouraged to [apply here](http://www.newscholarships.ac.nz/).
