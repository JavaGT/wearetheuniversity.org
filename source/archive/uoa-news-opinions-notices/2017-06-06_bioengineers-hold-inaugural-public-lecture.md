Bioengineers hold inaugural public lecture

Imagine going to the doctor and seeing a personalised 3D model of your heart, lungs and gut flash up on a computer screen.

This reality is not far off and to explain why and how, the University of Auckland’s Bioengineering Institute (ABI) is holding an inaugural public lecture on 22 June as part of New Zealand HealthTech Week.

Three leading researchers will demonstrate how they are using engineering, physics, mathematics, physiology, molecular biology and computer science to make computer models of the human body.

“We combine mathematical modelling with new experimental approaches and the development of new instrumentation and new medical devices,” says the director of ABI, Professor Peter Hunter.

At the lecture, Dr Alys Clark will demonstrate how she is developing virtual, computer-based lungs that behave like the real organ and can predict how somebody will respond to illness or treatment.

Dr Mark Trew will demonstrate computer models to simulate and understand heart disease such as heart attacks, while Dr Leo Cheng from ABI’s Gastrointestinal Group is developing technologies to monitor and modify stomach and intestinal muscle.

Says Professor Hunter: “The future of healthcare will increasingly rely on personalised models, informed by wearable instruments that monitor health status.”

**Date:** 22 June 2017, 5 - 7pm.

**Venue**: Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron

**Location**: 181 Westhaven Drive, Auckland Central.

**Editor’s notes**

The Auckland Bioengineering Institute lecture is part of the MedTalks initiative – an informal forum initiated by the MedTech Centre of Research Excellence, New Zealand’s nationwide medtech research community (styled along the lines of Café Scientifique).

The talks aim to empower the non-technical public to become better informed on new healthcare technologies, promote debate and highlight the interesting world-leading medical technology research that is happening in our own backyard.

The ABI MedTalks will be held during New Zealand’s HealthTech Week starting on June 19th. This is a week which brings together the stakeholders in the sector – industry, government, research, clinicians and investors – over a range of events to discuss new innovations in healthcare and policies as well as showcase NZ’s technology opportunities and research.

HealthTech Week is hosted by the Consortium for Medical Device Technologies and the Medical Technology Association of New Zealand.
