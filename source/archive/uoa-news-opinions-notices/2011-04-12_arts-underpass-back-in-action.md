Arts underpass back in action
=============================

The Symonds Street underpass linking Old Choral Hall to the Arts 1 building has reopened.

Students may find this an easier route between Sectors 100 and 200 than the congested intersection with Grafton Road especially in wet weather.

The underpass was closed while a glazed covered way was erected on the Arts 1 side. Currently it provides access to the Human Sciences and Arts 2 Buildings.

Entry to Arts 1 remains blocked while it is extensively refurbished. When the building is reoccupied in September the two previous entrances from the walkway will have merged into one.
