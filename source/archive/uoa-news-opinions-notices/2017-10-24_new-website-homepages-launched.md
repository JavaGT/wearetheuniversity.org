New website homepages launched
==============================

![Happy students holding mobile devices - phones, tablets, ipads - showing new faculty homepages: arts, business, creative arts and industries, education and social work, engineering and law.](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/news-events-and-notices/notices/notices-2017/09/new-website-homepages-to-be-launched/_jcr_content/par/textimage/image.img.jpg/1508798662616.jpg "Six faculty homepages launched today")

**The homepages of our faculties and large-scale research institutes are getting a new look.**

We are pleased to announce that new homepages for all faculty and large-scale research institute (LSRI) websites have been launched.

The new homepages have an additional menu that provides access to existing faculty and LSRI content. Each faculty and LSRI can use their homepage and menu to highlight and link to content that is appropriate and important for their specific audiences.Â 

The new pages are device-friendly and meet AA accessibility standards and have been designed in collaboration with faculty communications and marketing managers and content writers.

Take a look at the new homepages :
