Elam School of Fine Arts

Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland turns 125 this year and to mark the event, former students from the 1960s and 1970s are organising a reunion of their cohort, to take place during the last weekend in November.

The Anniversary Reunion, coinciding with the annual Elam Graduate Show, includes tours, a mix and mingle with former class mates and historic films and videos of Elam staff and students. Highlights include the showing of a TVNZ documentary about Elam, first screened in 1965.  
  
“Everyone who has attended Elam has contributed to the distinguished history of the school and we are tremendously proud that past students retain such a strong sense of belonging to Elam,” says Head of School Dr Peter Shand.

The renowned art school, established in 1889 following a bequest from arts patron Dr John Edward Elam, opened in 1890 in rooms located under the bell tower of what is now the Auckland Art Gallery.  
  
During the 1950s Elam was housed at two sites, one in Symonds Street and one in Grey Lynn. In 1962 the school moved to its current site in Whitaker Place at the University of Auckland.  
  
Art students from the 1950s-1970s interested in attending are asked to register.
