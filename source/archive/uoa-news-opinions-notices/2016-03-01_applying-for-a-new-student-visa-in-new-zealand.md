Applying for a new student visa in New Zealand
==============================================

When applying for your student visa in New Zealand, you have the option of applying through the International Student Information Centre, or directly through Immigration New Zealand. If you wish to apply to Immigration New Zealand, please read [Applying through Immigration New Zealand](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/for/international-students/is-life-at-auckland/is-student-support-and-services/is-specialised-support-for-international-students/is-renewing-your-student-visa-or-permit.html#INZ).

### **Immigration NZ**

**Option 1**: $250.00  -  [online application](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/secure/Login+Student.htm)

**Option 2:** $277.00  -  [manual application](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/8D76710A-1F4A-452F-8C5D-8663738F560A/0/INZ1013.pdf)

Please note: an enrolment letter will be required for your application with Immigration New Zealand. To request an enrolment letter please email [int-questions@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:int-questions@auckland.ac.nz)

Please note: The International Student Information Centre is only able to process a limited number of student visa applications each day (approx. 50). Therefore at this time of the year the visa queue can be very long. To avoid waiting in the queue, we recommend that you apply online directly with Immigration New Zealand (Option 1).
