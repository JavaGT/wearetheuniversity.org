Over the coming weeks the University is continuing with the next phase of implementing an improved website design, starting with content for future students.

We’ll continue to extend the design to other parts of the main University site.  This will mean that we will have a period of transition, during which you will see newer webpages replace the current ones.

The new website design will make finding information easier and is also more accessible, including for those with disabilities, meeting international standards to support our users with visual impairments.  Another advantage is that our site will be easily viewable on mobile devices.  

We look forward to sharing more information and value your feedback which can be sent to: [**webprogramme@auckland.ac.nz**](mailto:webprogramme@auckland.ac.nz)
