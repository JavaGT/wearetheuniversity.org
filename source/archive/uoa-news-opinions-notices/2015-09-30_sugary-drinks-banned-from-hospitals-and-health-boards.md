All hospitals and DHBs are expected to kick sugary drinks out of their premises today.

University of Auckland researcher, Dr Gerhard Sundborn who also heads public health advocacy group “FIZZ”, says he welcomes the initiative.

“FIZZ congratulates Minister Jonathan Coleman and Director General, Ministry of Health Chai Chuah, for the directive that has banned the sale of all sugary drinks from all hospitals and DHB premises,” he says.

“This initiative shows a strong commitment to meaningfully address childhood and adult obesity,” says Dr Sundborn. “It is hoped too that this model may be replicated in other sectors, for example education.

“Considering the harm that sugary drinks pose in their contribution to rotten teeth, diabetes and obesity this action will have strong population health benefits, particularly for our children.”

The MOH directive reaffirms the Minister of Health’s expectation that all DHBs throughout New Zealand are strengthening their approaches to help reduce the incidence of obesity, including in showing a commitment to limit sugary drinks.

In the directive the MOH said it acknowledged “the focus that DHBs were putting on the development of approaches to address obesity” and expected this work to be further enhanced in coming months when the next steps for the sector will be outlined, particularly in relation to childhood obesity.

A symposium that will look specifically at sugary drinks and health will be held by the University of Auckland (and supported by Otago University and Manukau Institute of Technology) on Wednesday 7 October in Manukau.

A focal point of the symposium will look at the development and consideration of a number of tax options on sugary drinks considering the increasing public acceptability of such a tax reported in recent polls.

“The exclusion of sugary drinks from hospitals and DHB premises is a significant achievement and positive legacy of Minister Coleman. We look forward to seeing the possible influence it may have in leading other sectors to create similar initiatives,” says Dr Sundborn.
