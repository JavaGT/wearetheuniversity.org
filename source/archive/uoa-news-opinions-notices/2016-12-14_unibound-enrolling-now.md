A head start for university study, the UniBound programme is aimed at Māori and Pacific students who are keen to study at tertiary level and want to boost their chances of success.

Now taking enrolments, the course runs in Summer School and Semester One and takes up to 200 students who, if successful, gain entry into a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science in semester two.

Students are enrolled in five courses (following either the Social Sciences and Humanities (Arts) or Physical, Informational and Computational Sciences (Science) stream) with a total of 75 points required.

They are able to cross credit 30 points towards their degree programme, ensuring they are on track to complete their degree in the usual three years.

The programme aims to strengthen literacy, numeracy and critical thinking skills and involves lectures, tutorials and seminars.

No fees are required for the summer school and all students will receive a public transport allowance, with Māori students from outside Auckland eligible for free accommodation in summer school.

All students will be eligible for an academic achievement grant up to the value of $1000 on successful completion.

Applicants must have completed Year 13 or equivalent in the calendar year they apply, and must be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident.
