Professor Rosalind Archer

University of Auckland’s head of Engineering Science, Professor Rosalind Archer, has been named the inaugural Energy Engineer of the Year at the Deloitte Energy Excellence Awards.

She is the first academic to be named in the awards, in a category sponsored by the Institute of Professional Engineers. The awards ceremony was held yesterday.

Professor Archer is head of Engineering Science at the Faculty of Engineering at the University and a specialist in reservoir engineering. She holds the Mercury Chair in geothermal reservoir engineering and is the Director of the Geothermal Institute. She is also a director of New Zealand Oil & Gas.

Professor Archer has a PhD in Petroleum Engineering with a PhD minor in Geological and Environmental Science from Stanford University and a Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Science from the University of Auckland.

She is involved in a range of geothermal research including the ‘Geothermal Supermodels’ project, a collaboration between the University and GNS Science, and she works with Los Alamos National Laboratories addressing micro-seismic activity.

She has been on the programme committee for several major international conferences and has published on reservoir engineering for more than 20 years.

“I am delighted to have received this honour and am particularly pleased to be the first academic researcher to be named Energy Engineer of the Year at these awards,” she says.

“The award, which was a wonderful surprise, also recognises the energy and support of a large cast of staff and students at the University whom I have the pleasure to work with.”
