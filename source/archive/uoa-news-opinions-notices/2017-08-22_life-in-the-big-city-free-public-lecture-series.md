Life in the big city – free public lecture series
=================================================

Do cyclists breathe easier on one side of a cycleway barrier than another? How much difference do trees really make to air quality? What happens when we bury natural streams beneath concrete and asphalt? How hard is it for native species to survive in cities?

These questions and more will be addressed in this year’s University of Auckland _Vice-Chancellor’s Lecture Series_, a series of four free public lectures which focus on life in the city and how vegetation, water, transport and wild spaces directly impact our health and wellbeing.

Auckland is New Zealand’s fastest-growing city, with another one million people expected to be living here by 2040. That means demand on space, housing and transport will only increase.

“People migrating to large urban areas is a trend that has been going on for a very, very long time and there is no sign of that reversing,” says Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences Associate Professor Kim Dirks of the School of Population Health.

“But what quality of city life should we be aiming for and how do we ensure cities are good places to live?”

This lecture series brings a multidisciplinary perspective to the discussion with a focus on human and environmental health in the face of urban intensification.
