Power outage at City campus
===========================

**Update: 10 Feb 2017 4:51pm** - Mains power has returned a few minutes ago after Vector bypassed the fault. Some secondary circuits may take longer to restore. Property Service standby staff will now work through the affected buildings to check restoration of building systems. Full building checks may take a few hours. 

10 Feb 2017 4:16pm - The University of Auckland is experiencing loss of power at its City campus following a fault with Vector’s high voltage network.

The University is working with Vector to restore power as soon as possible. Until then, the Sport and Recreation Centre, Kate Edger Information Commons, General Library and AUSA buildings are closed until further notice.

The remainder of the City campus, and the Newmarket, Grafton and Epsom campuses are unaffected and remain open.
