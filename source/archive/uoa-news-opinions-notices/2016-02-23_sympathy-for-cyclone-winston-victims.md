Sympathy for Cyclone Winston victims
====================================

The University of Auckland extends its sympathy to the people of Fiji and the Fijian community in New Zealand following the devastation caused by Cyclone Winston. In particular our thoughts and prayers are with our Fijian students whose families, friends and acquaintances have suffered in the cyclone.

Donations can be made to the [Red Cross’ Pacific Disaster Fund](https://www.redcross.org.nz/what-we-do/around-the-world/stories/red-cross-responds-to-cyclone-winston-in-fiji), which will be used to help directly on the ground in Fiji. Donations can also be made to [Oxfam’s Disaster Response Fund](https://www.oxfam.org.nz/donate/appeal/5024) or the [Auckland Mayoral Fund for the Pacific](http://www.aucklandcf.org.nz/grants-and-programmes/grants-and-funds/mayoral-fund-for-the-pacific/).
