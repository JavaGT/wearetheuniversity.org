University of Auckland wins global ranking for employable graduates
===================================================================

17 November 2016

The University of Auckland has been ranked internationally as New Zealand’s leading university for producing work-ready graduates.

The University was placed among the 150 leading universities for graduate employability in the Times Higher Education Global University Employability Ranking 2016, published today. The University maintained its 2015 ranking of 140 and was the only New Zealand university ranked in the top 150.

University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon says: “This ranking is further endorsement of the University of Auckland’s status as New Zealand’s leading university. We continue to focus on achieving excellence in all we do, including the very high quality education we offer New Zealanders which is of great value to employers and the wider community.”

Research for the rankings saw a long list of universities established in two steps: via an online survey of 2,500 recruitment managers in 20 countries, followed by a second panel of 3,500 international managers around the world.

Participating companies covered all major business sectors, had more than 5,000 employees each and recruited more than 50 graduates per year.

Survey participants were asked to define what they looked for in graduates and to choose the universities they believed produced the most employable graduates.
