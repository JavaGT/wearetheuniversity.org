Experts in the fields of architecture, planning and urban design will debate what makes good medium density housing at the upcoming Fast Forward lecture and discussion series starting at the University of Auckland next week.

Auckland has decided to grow up and in acknowledgment of the Unitary Plan’s increased density and height, this semester’s theme is ‘Doing medium density well’.

As the city looks to increase its medium density living options with terraced housing and apartments, Fast Forward speakers will consider how to do it well and ensure quality. 

Hosted by the School of Architecture and Planning the series will range from design to technical solutions, supporting both the public and the profession to procure good medium density design.  
  
Panel and audience discussions questioning how building design can establish a sense of community and whether very small, affordable apartments can be successful, are just some of the topics that will be covered.  
  
The series starting on the evening of Thursday 16 March, runs until May and includes a medium density housing summit, taking place in April.
