University of Auckland enters into partnership with essential news venture
==========================================================================

13 March 2017

The University of Auckland is a leading supporter of _Newsroom_, a new independent current affairs and news website.

_Newsroom_ is being developed by former head of news at MediaWorks (which includes television channel _Three_) Mark Jennings, and Tim Murphy, former editor-in-chief of the _New Zealand Herald_.  The website, which launched today, has an editorial team of 16 based in Auckland and Wellington.  

The University, as a founding partner of the news venture, will provide high-quality content and expert commentary for the site. It will join Holden New Zealand, telecommunications company Chorus, and Victoria University of Wellington as initial sponsors.

University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon says the University is uniquely placed to provide informed content and research-based analysis on issues which are critical to the country's future.

“In this rapidly changing world there is an appetite for high-grade, trusted content and our researchers and academics are already leaders in providing authoritative and informed news and expert commentary.

“_Newsroom_ is committed to credible and balanced journalism, and this is an opportunity for us to work together and generate a thoughtful New Zealand perspective, which adds to a broader global view. We also look forward to working with Victoria University on this initiative.”

Mark Jennings says universities have a vital role in informing the public.

“An ill-informed public threatens the democratic underpinnings of our society and economy.  The University has a charter to communicate its work as far as it can, and that combined with the high-calibre of its research and expert opinion makes it an ideal, independent source of information and analysis.”

_Newsroom_, a free, open site, launched today Monday 13 March. At the same time, a paid, subscription news feed, _Newsroom Pro_, will launch for corporates, professional services firms, public agencies and other organisations wanting up-to-the-minute news intelligence on a range of subject areas.
