11 March closing date for University of Canterbury students wishing to participate in an exchange to The University of Auckland for semester one
================================================================================================================================================

**Updated Wednesday 9 March**

Dear colleagues  
  
Firstly I would like to offer my sympathy to staff members with family, friends and acquaintances in Christchurch who have suffered loss and damage in the earthquake. I also ask you to keep a solicitous eye on students from Christchurch who find themselves in the same position. Whilst our counselling team has already spoken with many students who have been impacted by the earthquake, there may be others known to you who could be helped by a referral to this service. The University’s main counselling service is located on the City Campus; please contact +64 9 373 7599 ext 87681. Support for our staff is likewise available by contacting the Employee Assistance Programme on 0800 327 669.  
  
I know you will also join me in expressing sympathy to staff and students in Canterbury who have suffered loss and damage in the earthquake.  
  
A practical way for us to help our colleagues in Canterbury is to assist them retain as many of their students as possible thereby ensuring an ongoing learning community in the Canterbury region. I am in contact with the Vice-Chancellors of both the University of Canterbury and Lincoln University and have offered our support. Both universities, understandably, are continuing to work through myriad issues. As they identify specific support requirements these are being forwarded to me and we are responding as quickly as we can. 

### Message for University of Canterbury students wishing to participate in an exchange to The University of Auckland for semester one:

### Domestic students

We have been requested by Canterbury to enrol domestic students, on an exchange arrangement. At this stage we cannot predict how many Canterbury students we may accept on this basis. The closing date for applications is Friday 11 March. An application form is available now at [Canterbury registrations](https://uoa.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/uoa.cfg/php/enduser/doc_serve.php?2=transferrequestaucklanduni).  
  
Course Advice sessions will be available on Tuesday 8 March, Wednesday 9 March and Thursday 10 March between 2pm and 4pm at Level 1, Owen G Glenn Building, 12 Grafton Road.  
  
The University of Auckland will help students find accommodation in Auckland through its Accommodation office ([accom@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:accom@auckland.ac.nz)).  
  
In addition, The University of Auckland is exploring providing The University of Canterbury access to its online course materials and specialist laboratories.  
  
We also understand more comprehensive communications and options for domestic students are under development by the University of Canterbury with up to 500 students being offered study abroad options at the University of Adelaide for semester one.

### International students

At Canterbury’s request, international undergraduate students can spend this year’s first semester at Victoria University of Wellington, the University of Otago or The University of Auckland. Students who accept this exchange offer will return to the University of Canterbury for the second semester of 2011, with points obtained in Semester One contributing to their University of Canterbury qualification. The University of Canterbury will provide enrolment assistance for those who decide to spend the first semester at Victoria, Otago or Auckland. For more information about this exchange, students are asked to contact directly Canterbury’s Liaison Office at [liaison@canterbury.ac.nz](mailto:liaison@canterbury.ac.nz).

Should you have any support suggestions or specific questions please contact the Director of Academic Services Joanna Browne ([jo.browne@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:jo.browne@auckland.ac.nz)) in the first instance.

I will keep you updated with support arrangements as these develop further.

Stuart N. McCutcheon  
Vice-Chancellor
