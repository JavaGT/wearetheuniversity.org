NCEA students – important message
=================================

NCEA results have been made available to the University. We have begun assessing applications and will make decisions as soon as possible. It is important to note that decisions about some programmes may be made earlier than others. Please continue to check your online Application for Admission for updates.

**How to check your application status**

All you need to do is [sign into your Application for Admission](https://apply.auckland.ac.nz/). A summary page will appear that shows the status of your application(s).
