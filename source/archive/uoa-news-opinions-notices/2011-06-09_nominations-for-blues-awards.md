Nominations for Blues awards
============================

Nominations for The University of Auckland Arts and Cultural and Sports Blues are now being accepted.

The university blues awards are a nationwide tradition with its origins in England where the colours of Oxford and Cambridge universities came to symbolise excellence.

Nominees must be enrolled in the current academic year as well as meeting the other requirements for the relevant award. The nomination forms are available below.

Nominations close at 4.30pm, Friday 29 July.

Winners for the Arts and Cultural and Sports Blues will be announced at a dinner, held on Friday 16 September.
