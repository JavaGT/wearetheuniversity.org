> We the students and staff are the beating heart of this institution. We are not a bonus attached to a venture capitalist and real-estate development firm. This institution should exist for education, research, and service to the public; it should be led by the staff and students who make it happen. There can't be a university without us, our passion, and our labour. Management does not encompass the university. The university is a place of critical thinking, resistance to all oppressions are part of becoming a well-rounded and educationed person. We reject the neoliberal university, we reclaim the identity that management steals from us.
