# Sixth National Government of New Zealand
The National–Act–New Zealand First coalition government.

The values of the National-led coalition government in New Zealand represent a troubling shift towards economic opportunism and short-term wealth consolidation at the expense of social equity and environmental stewardship. By prioritising  the immediate financial interests of their donors and favouring landlords over tenants, the government undermines the rights and needs of vulnerable communities, particularly Māori. Their disregard for the Treaty of Waitangi provisions and the escalation of racial tensions reveal a troubling commitment to divisive rhetoric and exclusionary policies. This administration's insistence on swift governance over democratic accountability not only erodes public trust but also stifles meaningful dialogue with Māori and marginalised groups. Ultimately, their austerity and shock doctrine tactics are designed to break down public resources in order to further line the pockets of their wealth donors at the expense of the poor and working class.
