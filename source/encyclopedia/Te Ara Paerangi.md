# Summary

The stoppage of Te Ara Paerangi is a warning story. It is a demonstration of a comprehensive consultation processes being wasted at the alter of austerity and neoliberalism. These ideologies and the shills that peddle them, have significantly delayed the capacity of New Zealanders to advance their science and innovation sector to meet the needs of their increasingly vulnerable communities in the name of wealth consolidation for the rich, land-owning class.

It is a story of how the [[NACTNZF|Coalition Government]] ignores both the advice of experts and the public in order to line their own pockets with the wealth of corporate and foreign interests which have that expense returned to them from the public purse. Wretched politicians are facilitating the theft of social institutions, health, wealth, and community and taking their cut for themselves. 

Not only is the cancellation of Te Ara Paerangi inefficient (they threw away four years of planning and consultation from highly skilled researchers and consultants) – but it is also a sale of our future. They have thrown away investment into the future of New Zealand and its people. Plans to enhance the research system to solve wicked problems, tackle global and local challenges, look after our rivers, lakes, tamariki, health, communities, wildlife, and more have all been thrown away. That is, they have been sold to the highest bidder. The cuts to the science sector come from the same place as cuts to the health system, education, and other public services – they come from the bribes of the real-estate and tobacco industries into the pockets of right-wing politicians who have infested the New Zealand government.
