      | We the students and staff are the beating heart of this institution. We are not a bonus attached to a venture capitalist and real-estate development firm. This institution should exist for education, research, and service to the public; it should be led by the staff and students who make it happen. There can't be a university without us, our passion, and our labour. The university is not management.
      | #[br]
      | We reclaim the identity that management steals from us.

        | Dawn Freshwater has proposed a new combined faculty of Law and Business & Economics.
        | This will not stand again. The arts faculty has been decimated, there are issues with timetabling, increased workloads for staff, decreased quality and definition of their education for students. It was fast-tracked for the arts, and we know it'll happen again.
