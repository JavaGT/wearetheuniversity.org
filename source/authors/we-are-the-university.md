We Are The University was originally a student-led campaign at the University of Auckland in 2011. It has since been revived in 2024 as a reponse to the ongoing top-down authoritarian rule of universities in Aotearoa New Zealand. The campaign is a call to action for students, staff, and the wider community to reclaim the university as a site of critical thought, creativity, and social change. We Are The University is a platform for sharing stories, resources, and strategies for resisting the neoliberal university and building a university system that works for the people who make it happen.
