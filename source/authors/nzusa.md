The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA) is a representative body that advocates for the interests of tertiary students in New Zealand. Between 1935 and 2006, it was known as the New Zealand University Students' Association, until it merged with the national polytechnic students' association. â€“ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Union_of_Students%27_Associations)
