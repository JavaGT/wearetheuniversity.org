         <b>Education can't be funded on employment
outcomes</b></p><p>"The government needs to be careful when it
links tertiary education funding to performance that it
improves the performance of institutions rather than
shutting out students who are less likely to
succeed."</p><p>That is the view of TEU national president Dr
Tom Ryan, following an announcement this afternoon by
tertiary education minister Steven Joyce of a new funding
model which will see tertiary education providers receive a
proportion of their funding based on student
performance.</p><p>From 2012, five percent of tertiary education
institutions' funding will based on their numbers of course
completions, qualification completions, progressions to
higher study, and numbers of students retained in
study.</p><p>Dr Ryan says that the minister needs to make sure
the onus of his new funding model is on tertiary education
institutions to provide comprehensive pastoral care, and
high quality advice and academic planning. Otherwise there
is a danger that institutions will seek to lift their
funding by excluding students they think are less likely to
succeed, or that pressure will be put on teachers who have
tough academic standards.</p><p>"We are used to performance
funding in the tertiary education sector," said Dr Ryan.
"But we believe funding needs to support the right type of
performance - helping and supporting students to learn,
rather than risk New Zealand losing good staff and potential
new
students."</p><p></p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
