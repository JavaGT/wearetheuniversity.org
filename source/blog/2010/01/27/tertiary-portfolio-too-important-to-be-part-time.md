         <b>Tertiary Education portfolio too important to be
part-time job</b></p><p>The appointment of a new minister of
tertiary education confirms that tertiary education is too
big a job for a minister who already carries other
significant portfolios, said TEU national president Dr Tom
Ryan.  </p><p>"We welcome Mr Joyce to his new role as minister
of tertiary education, and hope that he sees it as his most
substantial portfolio. Tertiary education has a crucial role
to play in enriching our economy and our society. The
government's goals to increase productivity and
opportunities for young New Zealanders are linked to how
well our tertiary education system performs."  </p><p>Mr Joyce
faces challenging times as he picks up this portfolio –
not the least being the prospect of continuing industrial
action in parts of the polytechnic sector as students
return. The most significant tasks Mr Joyce will face as
minister include supporting a sector that suffered
significant funding cuts last year, finding a way to let
into study young New Zealanders who would not otherwise
normally get a chance at tertiary education, and helping our
polytechnics in their efforts to support regional economies
and communities.</p><p>"Tertiary education needs a minister who
can champion the end of funding cuts, who will invest in
opportunities and access for new students, and who will
drive innovative blue skies research. We wish Mr Joyce luck
with this task," concluded Dr Ryan.</p><p>ENDS
