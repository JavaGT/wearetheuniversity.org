<p>Student Exclusion Policies Ignore Student Population
Growth</p>

<p>Students are suffering because universities and the
Ministry of Education are wilfully ignoring an increase in
potential students says TEU national president, Dr Tom
Ryan.</p>

<p>Dr Ryan's comments follow news that Massey
University and the universities of Canterbury and Otago are
all toughening their student enrolment standards.</p>

<p>"The
Ministry and universities both know that there is a baby
boom-blip of 18 and 19 year olds currently trying to get
into tertiary education. There is pressure for places. The
current rhetoric about excluding underperforming students
ignores the reality."</p>

<p>"It is not just under-performing
students who are missing out, but young people who genuinely
want the chance to study and better themselves. If we want
to meet the minister's goals of increasing New Zealand's
productivity and wellbeing, by increasing the number of
young people engaged in study, especially Maori and
Pasifika, then we need to be improving access to
universities, not diminishing that access."</p>

<p>"The benefits
for the whole country of getting new people into university
education are too precious to pass up by pretending that the
only people being excluded are not up to the task. We need
more funding, more access, and more opportunities for our
young people. Instead we are seeing funding cuts and fewer
opportunities," concluded Dr Ryan.<p>
