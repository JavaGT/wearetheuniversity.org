<p><b>Education can't be funded on employment
outcomes</b><br><b></b><br>Steven Joyce's suggestion this
afternoon that tertiary funding should be linked to
employment outcomes rather than academic outcomes is a
dangerous path to propose.  That is the view of TEU national
president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>

<p>Mr Joyce, the minister of tertiary
education, told an audience at Victoria University of
Wellington this afternoon that he would like to see tertiary
education funding linked to employment outcomes. He
suggested this would send a strong signal to students about
which qualifications and which institutions offer the best
career prospects.</p>

<p>"The risk of this approach is that
institutions which can get students to take cheap quick
qualifications with good short-term employment prospects are
likely to be much better rewarded," said Dr Ryan.
"Meanwhile, those which maintain higher academic standards
but are teaching students about issues and subjects that may
not have immediate application to students' employment
prospects could suffer."</p>

<p>"Providing job skills is
important, but it is just one aspect of a broader tertiary
education. It would be a shame to see institutions being
encouraged by government to water down their commitment to
teaching and research programmes that explore social and
cultural and other dimensions that can not show immediate
economic or employment outcomes."</p>

<p>"The short-term whims of
employers cannot be the key driver for the quality and
direction of education that our young people receive," said
Dr
Ryan.</p>
