<p><b>League tables obscure what we already
know</b><br><b></b><br>Predictably, tertiary institutions
with higher numbers of part time students, extramural
students, older students and second-chance learners rank
poorly compared to other universities, polytechnics and
wānanga in today’s Tertiary Education Commission league
tables.</p>

<p>"But, that says nothing about their actual
performance," says TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs. "It
just says they started with the students who have to travel
the longest journey."</p>

<p>"Education should be about giving
everyone a chance to do something good, for themselves, for
their families and their communities.  League tables like
those released today simply tell institutions and their
prospective students that we measure success not by how far
you come but how far in front you start before the journey
even begins."</p>

<p>"It will be interesting to see, now that the
government has its much vaunted ranking of tertiary
institutions," says Ms Riggs, "whether it responds by giving
those institutions at the foot of the tables the support
they need to keep helping their students achieve, or if it
now abandons them to face public scrutiny alone."</p>

<p>TEU is
worried that if students and the public look at these tables
without the context of knowing what individual institutions
are trying to do, all they will see is irrelevant
comparisons and bad measurements.  Institutions that are
working hard in their local communities will take an
unnecessary, and undeserved, hit to their reputation from
which it will be hard to
recover.</p>
