         <strong>VSM = bad for Auckland, bad for
students</strong></p><p>AUSA condemns the Select Committee’s
endorsement of the Act Party's Education (Freedom of
Association) Amendment Bill. The Bill would devastate
students’ associations across the country and destroy
services that provide students with support, representation
and a community.</p><p>AUSA is the only voluntary association in
the country, following a 1999 referendum in which students
narrowly chose to adopt the model of voluntary student
membership (VSM). Proponents of the Act Party Bill often
hold up AUSA as a model for VSM.</p><p>“The reality actually
shows that VSM is a disaster in practice, in Australia,
Waikato University, and Unitec. AUSA has survived despite
VSM, not because of it,” says AUSA President Elliott
Blade.</p><p>“When AUSA went voluntary in 1999 we had to cut
many services and staff. Students suffered under these cuts
and we continue to be constrained in how we can effectively
serve students’ needs and wants under a voluntary
regime,” says Blade.</p><p>An NZUSA-commissioned economic
analysis by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that  service
levels would fall by between 48 and 73 percent under
voluntary membership. In Australia, voluntary membership
reduced fee income by more than 95 percent. </p><p>Such dramatic
revenue losses in New Zealand would see massive reductions
in services and facilities on campus and the loss of a
student voice within institutions. For students, their
experience on campus will be seriously diminished by this
Bill.
</p>
<p>“Most campuses around the country will bear the
brunt of this Bill. AUSA’s situation is unique and is not
replicated elsewhere. Our long history with the University,
commercial assets built up under student ownership, and
getting a contract for services allowed us to survive,”
says AUSA Education Vice-President Alex Nelder.</p><p>“Our
ability to provide independent and effective services has
been drastically compromised. While we have been able to
maintain services to some extent by entering into a contract
for services with the University, our ability to be an
independent student voice from the University has been
irredeemably damaged,” says Nelder.</p><p>“Worst of all,
students still pay. To provide the services we used to
provide, the University of Auckland has one of the highest
student services levies in the country. Students have no say
over how high this fee is set, or where the money goes. The
fee is much higher than at other campuses nationwide,”
says Nelder.</p><p>“National has chosen to ignore our example
which shows that VSM is a disaster in practice. National
does not have to sacrifice students on the discredited
ideological altar of the ACT Party . We urge the National
Party to listen to the 98% of submissions against the Bill
and reconsider,” concludes Mr
Blade.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
