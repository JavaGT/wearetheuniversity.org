<p><b>Overseas academics won’t take the
risk</b><br><b></b><br>Rather than increase labour mobility,
as the government intends, the 90 day fire at-will-law will
make people more reluctant to change jobs. That is the view
of the TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs, in her submission
to the Industrial Relations Select Committee this week.</p>

<p>Ms
Riggs believes that the 90 day fire-at-will provision in the
government’s proposed new employment laws will scare some
of the world’s best academics off taking the risk of
working in New Zealand.</p>

<p>"Tertiary education employees will
be at their most vulnerable when changing jobs, and this
will make them more reluctant to move here. Many New Zealand
academics may decide it is safer to take an overseas job
offer as their next career step, leaving New Zealand for
better job security overseas."</p>

<p>Ms Riggs is also worried
that many immigrants will be reluctant to undertake the
considerable risk and upheaval to come to New Zealand if
they are aware their new employment may be subject to a
90-day no-rights trial.</p>

<p>"New Zealand recruits a
significant proportion of academics from overseas – we
actively seek to learn from their knowledge and experience. 
However tertiary institutions will find that their
opportunity to recruit excellent overseas candidates
diminishes, because academics will be unwilling to risk
moving here with such uncertainty around their continued
employment."</p>
