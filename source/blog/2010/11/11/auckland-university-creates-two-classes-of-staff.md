<p>Auckland University creates two classes of staff</p>

<p>The
University of Auckland has hired over one hundred academics
in the past few months under lesser terms and conditions
than their colleagues doing the same work. This new
casualised category of staff, Professional Teaching Fellows
(PTFs), are mostly on fixed-term agreements and do not
progress incrementally in salary like other academics. The
new PTF category effectively replaces the Senior Tutor
position.</p>

<p>"Academics are increasingly losing their job
security," says Dr Joce Jesson, Principal Lecturer at the
university's School of Critical Studies in Education and
member of the Tertiary Education Union. "It is unfair for
the university to employ people doing the same work on
different conditions," Dr Jesson adds.</p>

<p>TEU members have
been negotiating for two months for PTFs to have the same
employment rights and conditions as other academic
staff.</p>

<p>So far the university has refused.</p>

<p>Other issues
union members want addressed through the bargaining include
parity with other universities in regards to annual leave
and some incremental salary steps for non-academic
staff.</p>

<p>"We are a leading university but in terms of some
significant working conditions of staff we lag behind other
universities in New Zealand," says Dr Paul Taillon, Senior
Lecturer in History at  university.</p>

<p>"After nine meetings
with our employer we are no further ahead in our
negotiations than we were on day one," says Cerian Wagstaff,
co-president of the University of Auckland branch of TEU,
"the university has basically refused every one of our
claims, even those that don't cost any money."</p>

<p>"All the
other universities have settled, or are close to settling,
their collective agreements on reasonable terms in an
atmosphere of collegiality. It is clear that those employers
see the value of engaging in meaningful negotiations with
unions representing their employees," says Dr
Taillon.<br>ends<br><p>
