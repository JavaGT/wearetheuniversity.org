<p>Student membership bill will create unfunded costs and
workload</p>

<p>Staff in tertiary institutions will be among
those who suffer the practical consequences of the National
Party's decision to introduce voluntary student membership,
says TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>

<p>"Students’
associations provide all sorts of services that support
communities of students at polytechnics and universities. At
the moment students decide amongst themselves what those
services are, they organise them, and they pay for them.
Under the new legislation those services will either
disappear or university and polytechnic managers will decide
what services to keep and then take money from their already
tightly stretched budgets to pay for them. Then they will
get already busy staff to organise them."</p>

<p>"In other words
students will still pay, this time through their compulsory
student fees instead of their compulsory student association
levy. Students will lose their control, and staff will gain
extra workload that they don't want. And yet this bill is
supposedly about choice."</p>

<p>Dr Ryan says it is ironic that
in voting for this bill the National Party will be
overturning legislation it previously introduced itself, so
as to give a policy concession to their coalition partners
the ACT Party.</p>

<p>"It's disappointing that the National Party
appears to be willing to overturn its own long standing and
pragmatic student association membership legislation to
pander to the ideologues of the ACT
Party."</p>
