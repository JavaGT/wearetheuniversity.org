<p><i><b>Joyce to justify tertiary plans to union
members</b></i></p>

<p>Minister for tertiary education Steven
Joyce will give his first public speech to members of the
Tertiary Education Union when he addresses their annual
conference next week.</p>

<p>In the last year Mr Joyce has often
talked about the $11 billion his government is investing to
help New Zealanders improve our economic growth and
productivity. However, these comments have largely been in
his capacity as minister for transport, referring mainly to
spending on new roads, rather than in his role as minister
for tertiary education. In the latter role he has often said
there will not be any significant cash injections in the
foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Delegates at the conference will be
eager to hear Mr Joyce explain his introduction of league
tables, performance funding, and an overall budget freeze
for the tertiary education sector.</p>

<p>He will be speaking to
over a hundred delegates from universities, polytechnics,
wānanga and other tertiary education institutions and
organisations around the country.</p>

<p><b>Mr Joyce’s
presentation will be at the Brentwood Hotel in Kemp St,
Kilbirnie, Wellington, at 11.45am on Tuesday 9
November.</b><b></b></p>

<p>Also speaking at the conference will
be TEU national president, Dr Tom Ryan (10am Mon 8 Nov), and
Australian tertiary education union leaders Jeannie Rea
(NTEU president, 3.30pm Mon 8 Nov), Pat Forward (AEU TAFE
federal secretary, 9.15am, Tues 9 Nov), and Carolyn Allport
(NTEU past president, 2pm, Tues 9 Nov).</p>

<p>Media are welcome
to attend any of these
speeches.</p>
