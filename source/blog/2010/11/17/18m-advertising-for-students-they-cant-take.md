<p><strong>Tertiary Education Union media
release</strong><br><strong></strong><br>17 November
2010</p>

<p><strong>$18 million advertising for students they
can’t take</strong><br><strong></strong><br>Universities,
polytechnics and wānanga are spending millions of dollars
advertising to students even though there are more potential
students than there are student places in New
Zealand.</p>

<p>"Why would tertiary institutions spend all this
public money promoting themselves when many of them are
complaining that they have too many students already?" asked
TEU president-elect Dr Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Dr Grey was responding
to figures from a Parliamentary Library query by Green Party
tertiary education spokesperson Gareth Hughes. The figures
show 16 tertiary education institutions are collectively
spending over $18 million dollars of public funding and
student fees to advertise and market themselves. New
Zealand’s other fifteen public tertiary institutions that
are not included in the survey either failed to respond to
the parliamentary request for information, or have so far
refused to provide the information.</p>

<p>"It’s appalling to
see so many institutions that are struggling so much that
they regularly lay off staff spending 1, 2 or even 10
percent of their budget advertising for students that they
end up turning away", said Dr Grey.</p>

<p>"If the government
wants value for its investment why does it let institutions
compete amongst themselves with our money. Advertising is
not the best way to give students important information
about education and career choices."
</p>

<p>"While these figures
should be read with caution because of the wide and varying
definitions of marketing we still reach the conclusion that,
on average, these institutions are spending over $1 million
each promoting themselves when they don’t need to,"  said
Dr Grey.</p>

interpreting the above figures</p>

<p>The figures given above may
not necessarily be directly comparable with each other
because it is not clear that all TEIs are counting the same
set of activities as advertising/marketing expenses. The
University of Canterbury and the University of Waikato both
expressed this concern when discussing their responses. As
part of their response the University of Canterbury provided
the following list of activities they normally classify as
advertising/marketing:</p>

<p>•	Magazines</p>

<p>•	Directory
listing</p>

<p>•	Radio advertising</p>

<p>•	School
advertising</p>

<p>•	Television advertising</p>

<p>•	Newspaper

<p>•	Online advertising</p>

<p>•	Outdoor

<p>•	Postgraduate
