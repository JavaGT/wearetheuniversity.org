         <b>We need an open debate about open
entry</b><br><b></b><br>Open entry to universities is an
important tenet of our tertiary education system and to the
notion of an egalitarian society according to TEU national
secretary Sharn Riggs.</p><p>"It is about giving people a chance
improve their life, and contribute to their community and
the economy in new ways. Before this government scraps it,
it needs to pause and talk to the community and business, to
make sure this is really the best way of saving a few
dollars."</p><p>Ms Riggs' comments follow a statement by
tertiary education minister Steven Joyce that a review of
open entry for over-20s was under way.</p><p>Currently New
Zealanders over the age of 20 are allowed automatic entry to
university.</p><p>"Universities and polytechnics are full with
new students, rolls are growing rapidly and schools are full
with final year students who want a tertiary education next
year," said Ms Riggs. "The government needs to recognise
that every time it denies funding for these students it is
also denying New Zealanders the chance to do something new
for their families and communities, it is denying our
economy a chance to be more productive, and it is denying
New Zealanders a crucial tool to combat the
recession."</p><p>"The Government needs to increase the overall
amount it spends on the sector. It needs to recognise that
access to tertiary education is an investment not a cost,"
said Ms
Riggs.</p><p>ENDS</p><p></p><p><br>
