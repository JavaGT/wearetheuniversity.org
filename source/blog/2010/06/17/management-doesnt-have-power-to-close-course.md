<p><b>University Management doesn't have power to close Hawkes
Bay course</b><br><b></b><br>Massey University management
does not have the authority to axe the university's primary
teacher education course in the Hawkes Bay.  That is the
view of TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>

<p>Massey is
moving to close its Ruawharo teacher training course,
forcing students to study extramurally or move to Palmerston
North instead.  But the union representing university staff,
TEU, believes that the university's decision is not a fait
accompli and that its management does not have the authority
to make such a decision without first seeking the approval
of the university's council.</p>

<p>The union wrote to the
chancellor last week saying that it believes the decision is
primarily an "academic matter" as per section 182(2) (a) of
the Education Act 1989 and thus a matter for the council to
decide, rather than university management.</p>

<p>Dr Ryan says
that there have been several similar instances where a
management decision to close a course has been overruled by
a council after the council ruled that the decision was an
academic matter rather than a management one.</p>

<p>"We are
requesting that the matter be put before the council," said
Dr Ryan. "And, until the council makes a decision no action
should be taken to discontinue delivery of the primary
teaching programme from the Ruawharo site in the Hawkes
Bay."</p><p>ENDS</p>
