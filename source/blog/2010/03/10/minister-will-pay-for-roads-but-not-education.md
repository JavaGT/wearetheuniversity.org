<p><b>Minister Will Pay for Roads But Not
Education</b></p>

<p>Yesterday Steven Joyce, the minister of
tertiary education said that he was "acutely aware of how
important better educational outcomes for our young people
are to strengthening our economy for the future" but then
went on to say "it is highly unlikely that there will be any
significant cash injections in the foreseeable future,"
Today Mr Joyce the minister of transport lauded his
government's investment of $10 billion dollars of new
spending over ten years into roads.<p>

<p>TEU national
President Dr Tom Ryan says this disparity of investment is
perplexing.<p>

<p>"Last year the government cut over $100
million of direct funding to tertiary institutions and there
is no indication that this money will be returned," said Dr
Ryan.</p>

<p>"It's for someone else to say whether a bit of
tarmac is going to promote productivity and deal with the
pay differential between NZ and Australia as successfully as
investing in our world class tertiary education system."<p>

<p>"I do wonder how the minister of tertiary education and
of transport can tell one audience there is no money and
everyone needs to tighten their belts, and another audience
that he is committed to investing to enhance national
economic growth and productivity, and then actually only
directing resources in one direction," said Dr
Ryan.</p>
