         <b>Victoria University’s "Magoo Management" Unacceptable,
Says Union</b></p><p>"Victoria University is proposing to cut
four academic staff positions from its flagship School of
Government – while failing to consider the impact on
students, the public sector and the School’s future," said
Tertiary Education Union organiser, Michael Gilchrist,
today.</p><p>"There is nothing in the change proposal that
describes the impact of staff cuts on course offerings, what
courses will or will not be taught in the future and how
students will be supported in completing their courses and
degrees," Mr Gilchrist said.</p><p>“Further, while the
proposal is based on an estimated shortfall in revenue for
the school, there is no analysis of the considerable costs
of redundancies against the supposed benefits of the change
and no estimate of the impact on future revenue of losing
the significant income that comes from student funding and
student fees in these areas of study.</p><p>There is, simply, no
forward strategic vision, academic or financial. This is
"Magoo management".</p><p>"In fact, total enrolments in the
School at 9 March this year are up nearly 12 percent from
those in 2009. So the university runs the risk of making a
really regrettable decision through a lack of due
diligence", Mr Gilchrist said.</p><p>"The university has shown a
willingness to consider alternative cost cutting suggestions
from staff, including offer of reductions in hours, leave
without pay, early retirement and the like. We applaud moves
in this area.</p><p>"But staff are immensely frustrated by the
failure of management to work to a strategic plan or to
provide any scenarios that estimate the impact, both
academic and financial of the changes they are proposing",
Mr Gilchrist
concluded.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
