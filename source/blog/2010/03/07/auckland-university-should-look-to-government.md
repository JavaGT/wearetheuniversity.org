         Auckland University Should Look To Government, Not Students,
For Money</p><p>Staff and students shouldn't be competing for
the same money, says TEU<br>national secretary Sharn
Riggs.</p><p>Ms Riggs' comments were made in response to a
suggestion by University<br>of Auckland vice-chancellor,
Stuart McCutcheon, that the 'balance of<br>investment' in
universities needs to shift to the maintenance
or<br>enhancement of quality rather than student
support.</p><p>"Yes, universities will suffer if we do not
invest to keep good staff<br>here in New Zealand. Yes, there
are overseas universities keen to<br>recruit our best staff.
Yes, salaries do need to rise. And I don't<br>think anyone
wants that to be at the expense of an accessible
and<br>equitable tertiary education system at which the
children of all our families<br>can aspire to study."</p><p>"The
government's role is not to take money off students and give
it to<br>vice chancellors, but to recognise that putting
money into the whole<br>tertiary education sector and the
people who work there is not a cost<br>but a high paying
investment," said Ms Riggs.</p><p>ENDS
