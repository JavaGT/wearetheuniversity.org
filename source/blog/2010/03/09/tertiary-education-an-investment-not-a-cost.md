<p><b>Tertiary Education An Investment Not a Cost</b></p>

<p>The
minister of tertiary education has rightly identified the
need for greater accountability in spending on tertiary
education, says TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>

<p>Ryan
was responding to Steven Joyce's first speech as minister of
Tertiary Education this morning. The minister called for
5-10 percent of government funding to tertiary providers to
be linked to student performance, as measured by course and
qualification completion rates, and student
progression.</p>

<p>"But Mr Joyce needs to be careful he doesn't
incentivise the wrong behaviour by saying he will reward
higher pass rates with more funding," says Ryan. "Shifting
money around and getting institutions, staff members, or
students to compete between themselves will not solve the
real problem – that universities, polytechnics, and
wananga need to be better funded if they are to successfully
compete with their international equivalents and deliver the
educational outcomes this country needs."</p>

<p>"If it is
sustainable quality that Mr Joyce wants, then the best way
to do that is to invest in recruiting and retaining the best
staff to work in New Zealand tertiary institutions. That
means better salaries and competitive working conditions",
said Dr Ryan.</p>

<p>"And while the minister may be justified in
calling for better monitoring of student loans, he also
needs to ensure that tertiary institutions provide adequate
services to support students – especially those from less
privileged backgrounds – through tough times so that they
are sufficiently equipped to deal with their
studies."</p>
