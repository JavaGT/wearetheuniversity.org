         <b>Students welcome community support for strong student
services</b></p><p>As orientation weeks around the country
wrap up this week, tertiary students can take heart that the
wider community supports strong student services and
maintaining their quality of education.</p><p>A broad
coalition of community groups called ‘Save Our Services’
was launched yesterday afternoon to save student services
from ACT MP Roger Douglas’ voluntary student membership
bill. NZUSA joins Rural Women New Zealand, the Quality
Public Education Coalition, the Tertiary Education Union,
UniQ Victoria, the Council of Trade Unions, Te Mana Akonga
and University Sport New Zealand, as members of the Save Our
Services coalition.</p><p>“We are very pleased to be
part of this coalition of public groups who support the
current law and the work student associations do,” says
NZUSA co-President David Do. </p><p>“Roger Douglas’
bill will put the quality of education for hundreds of
thousands of tertiary students all around the country at
risk,” says Do.</p><p>Students benefit from the
representation, welfare, and experience student associations
provide everyday. Student representation plays an important
part in quality assurance at institutions. Student
activities like clubs, sports, and societies enrich the
experience a student has on campus. Tertiary institutions
value the role and services that student associations
provide.</p><p>The bill, if passed, will devastate
important student association services to students. Students
will either experience a reduction in the services and
student life previously provided by student associations, or
a reduction in the quality of their education because
institutions will be forced to divert funding from core
business (teaching and research) to maintain services
currently provided by student associations.

<p>“We
need to save our services from this Bill because the
students’ voice will be silenced, services to students
will be lost, and the cost to students will be massive,”
says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.</p><p>“Student
needs are best served by organisations run by students, for
students. We believe it is up to students to make the
decisions on what membership model to have, not for
Parliament to interfere in independent incorporated
societies,” concludes Delaney.</p><p>NZUSA is the
national representative body for tertiary students and has
been advocating on student issues since
1929.</p><p>ENDS<br>+
