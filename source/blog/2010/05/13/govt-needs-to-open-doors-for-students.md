<p><b>Govt Needs to Open Doors for Students</b></p>

<p>Government
needs to act quickly to make sure that thousands of young
New Zealanders do not have the opportunity to learn ripped
away from them, says TEU president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>

<p>"The move
by universities across New Zealand to dramatically restrict
entry to many of their courses is the result of government
failure to anticipate the combined pressure of demographic
growth in student numbers and an increase in people looking
to study during the recession.”</p>

<p>"The government's policy
of capping the number of students it is willing to fund
needs to be reviewed. It is hurting the productivity of our
economy. That policy made some sense when tertiary
institutions were competing among themselves for students
and were more focused on growth than quality. But in an
environment when there is real growth in student numbers
across the sector, the policy now is denying a rapidly
growing number of young people the opportunity to get the
skills and knowledge they are entitled to.</p>

<p>"Most of
those who face missing out on the chance to study are
ordinary struggling New Zealanders. These are the very
people who most need that opportunity to study, to
contribute to the betterment of their families, the wider
community, and our struggling economy," said Dr
Ryan.</p>
