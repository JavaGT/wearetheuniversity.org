<p><b>Student fee changes see Auckland students worse off
</b></p>

<p>University of Auckland students will be
disadvantaged by the tertiary education changes highlighted
in the Budget today, and will end up paying substantially
more for their courses.<p>

<p>The 2010 budget has removed
the fee and course cost maxima system, replacing it with an
annual fee movement level set at four percent.<p>

<p>“Previously, the numerical cap had protected Auckland
students, because we were already charging the highest fee
possible, meaning annual rises have been less than five
percent. This has kept the cost of tertiary education low,
making it accessible for a wide range of people to
participate” said Alex Nelder, Auckland University
Students’ Association (AUSA) Education Vice President.</p>

<p>“Auckland University students already pay the highest
student fees in New Zealand and these changes will further
increase the debt burden on our students” said Mr. Nelder.
“The four percent threshold appears small, yet the fees
for a first year student in a conjoint Law and Arts degree
will have increased by 20 percent at completion.”</p>

<p>“Student debt will reach 20 billion dollars by 2022
– these changes will further serve to pass the buck of
under funding in the tertiary sector onto students, and will
contribute to the already massive debt burden on students
and graduates in New Zealand” said Mr. Nelder.</p>

<p>“The Government urgently needs to address the high
level of student debt in this country, before student fees
become so high that only the few can participate. New
Zealand needs to become an innovative, highly educated and
high skilled population. These changes undermine this goal
and will invariably shut more people out of education,”
said AUSA President Elliott Blade.</p>
