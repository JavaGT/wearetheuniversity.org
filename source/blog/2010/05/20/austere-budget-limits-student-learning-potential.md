<p><b>Austere Budget Limits Learning Potential for
Students</b></p>

<p>Bill English's second budget will do nothing
to enhance the innovation, learning and research going on in
tertiary education institutions around the country, says TEU
national president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>

<p>"New Zealand has a world
class tertiary education system, with world class people
staffing it, and is a crucial driver of a healthy,
productive economy. But it can't do that effectively when
the government keeps shrinking the pool of public money to
fund the sector."</p>

<p>The total Vote Education has not even
kept up with the rate of inflation. Within tertiary
education sector things are even worse, with most budget
lines either remaining static or falling behind.</p>

<p>For
instance, the minister of tertiary education says pastoral
care for students is crucial to education quality. In
practice, what that means is cuts of over $40 million over
the next four years due to the finance minister’s
prescription for improved efficiency within the student
support system.</p>

<p>"Thousands of tertiary education students
and staff are poised to be part of an exciting economic
recovery. However, the government's response is to buy a few
hundred students new places in universities and polytechnics
by making cuts to the quality of their education," said Dr
Ryan.</p>
