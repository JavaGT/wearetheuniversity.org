<p><b>Minister Cannot Wash His Hands of Funding
Responsibility</b></p>

<p>The minister of tertiary education
cannot simply wash his hands of his responsibility to fund
universities, polytechnics and wānanga properly, says TEU
national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>"The minister has said
repeatedly that he will spend no more money on tertiary
education in this year's budget.  This morning he is in the
paper saying that he thinks foreign students and
philanthropists should pick up the cost instead," said Ms
Riggs. "What he is actually saying is that the sector is
severely underfunded, but it's not his problem."</p>

<p>"Even if
we were to ignore the risks of having the long term
financial viability and the quality of our tertiary
education system reliant on overseas students and friendly
cash-rich donors, Mr Joyce's proposal would still be hugely
unfair."</p>

<p>"Tairāwhiti Polytechnic for example does not
have the history of alumni and private investors that they
can call upon compared with somewhere like the University of
Auckland, let alone Harvard University.  There are some
important things we need to fund even if they do not appeal
to foreign students or wealthy philanthropists."</p>

<p>"For
instance the minister himself regularly says that tertiary
institutions need to provide more pastoral care for their
students.  This is exactly the kind of service that his
government needs to fund because private donors are
unlikely, unwilling or unable to provide it equitably to all
students,"said Ms Riggs. She went on to say that Mr Joyce's
reference to the commercialisation of research as a way of
raising funds will also ring alarm bells for academics
concerned about the independence of their
research.</p>
