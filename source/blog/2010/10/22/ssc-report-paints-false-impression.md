         <b>SSC report paints false impression</b><br><b></b><br>The
State Services Commissioner's comments yesterday that there
has been a big rise in the number of people earning more
than $100,000 a year at universities, wānanga, and
polytechnics, and that the sector needs to exercise more
restraint, gives a false impression of the what is happening
in the sector.</p><p>Tertiary Education Union national secretary
Sharn Riggs says that ordinary staff in the sector have
exercised considerable restraint over the last year and a
half.</p><p>"Most people working in tertiary education have had
pay increases less than the rate of inflation in the 18
months since the economic crisis hit."</p><p>"The commissioner's
report focuses on an increase in the total number of people
earning over $100,000. But virtually all general staff
across the sector and academics in polytechnics earn nowhere
near that amount of money. Even the majority of academics in
universities, who operate in a competitive international
market, do not get that sort of salary."</p><p>"The State
Services Commissioner has used the salaries of highly paid
managers in the sector as a justification for proposing pay
restraints on a completely different group of workers - on
ordinary working people in the tertiary education sector
that are earning an average New Zealand salary," said Ms
Riggs.</p><p></p><p>ENDS</p><p></p><p><br>
