         <b>Student teachers should be supervised by registered
teachers </b><br><b></b><br>A new Teachers Council
requirement that anyone supervising a student teacher must
themselves be a registered teacher should bring an end to
universities pressuring staff without practicing
certificates into supervising students. That is the view of
TEU national president, Dr Tom Ryan.</p><p>TEU has welcomed the
council's new approval, review and monitoring processes,
saying is good to see that the council has listened to the
views of actual teacher educators.  </p><p>Dr Ryan says that in
recent years TEU has had concerns that some academic staff
in initial teacher education providers who do not have
formal teaching qualifications have been pressured by
institutions into supervising student teachers on their
placement. </p><p>"Teaching is an applied professional
qualification where practice are just as important as
research. We would not expect academics who lack a nursing
qualification to be supervising student nurses in hospitals.
Likewise, it is only reasonable that student teachers doing
practicums with children should be supervised by registered
teachers."</p><p></p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
