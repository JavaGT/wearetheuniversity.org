<p><b>Massey University to hire staff for good, not just 90
days</b><br><b></b><br>The Tertiary Education Union
announced today that it has negotiated that any new staff
hired at Massey University will not be subject to a ninety
day fire-at-will provision.  Massey University has committed
that, even if the government's introduces its proposed new
employment laws which deny workers their basic personal
grievance rights in the first ninety days of work, those
laws will not apply to staff at Massey University.</p>

<p>TEU
deputy secretary Nanette Cormack said good employers
shouldn't have any need for the government's proposed new
laws.</p>

<p>"Good employers are willing to put the effort into
advertising, interviews, training and management so they
keep their staff for a long time not a few months."</p>

<p>Ms
Cormack said the proposed employment laws were pernicious,
and had no place in a modern workplace like Massey
University.</p>

<p>"Good employers already have the tools they
need to give workers a chance, trial them and even dismiss
them, without taking away basis employment rights. Workers
don't want these new laws and good employers don't need
them. Which raises the question who they are really
for?"</p>

<p>"One of the things union members wanted from these
negotiations was to keep their existing fair work rights.
This result is the outcome of union members and employers
doing what the usually do – working productively together
for a better workplace," said Ms
Cormack.</p><p>ENDS</p>
