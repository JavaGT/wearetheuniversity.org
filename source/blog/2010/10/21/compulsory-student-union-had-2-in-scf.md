<p><b>Compulsory student union had $200,000 in SCF</b></p>

<p>The
compulsory University of Canterbury Students Association
(UCSA) invested $200,000 in South Canterbury Finance during
2009, pro-voluntary membership group Student Choice revealed
today.  UCSA’s investment in SCF was part of an investment
portfolio totalling $2.2 million in 2009.</p>

<p>The information,
from UCSA’s 2009 financial report, comes to light as
Parliament debates a bill to restore voluntary membership to
student unions. Supporters of compulsory membership claim
that the bill will cut unions’ income but they fail to
mention that compulsory membership has been a goldmine for
unions.</p>

<p>Compulsory membership means that unions receive
guaranteed income year after year, regardless of how they
perform.  This has given some unions excessive income, some
of which they invest.  In 2009 UCSA had fixed interest
investments totalling $1.3 million, equity and shares of
$440,000 and short-term investments of $400,000.</p>

<p>Other
compulsory unions have used students’ money to buy houses.
The compulsory Waikato Students Union owns four rental
properties in Hamilton. According to its submission against
the Freedom of Association bill, WSU said the houses were
bought “in an attempt to influence the rising cost of
rental properties in the university area.”</p>

<p>Supporters of
compulsory membership want to protect the unearned income
they take from students  Arguments against voluntary
membership amount to a small group of people trying to
protect an anomalous law that gives them the ability to
stick their hands in students’
pockets.</p>
