<p>Government to blame for skyrocketing fees</p>

<p>Government to
blame for skyrocketing fees, say Auckland students</p>

<p>The
University of Auckland Council has approved a 6.3 per cent
increase in domestic student fees for 2011, but the move has
been heavily opposed by students who blame the need for the
massive increase in student debt squarely on the
Government.</p>

<p>The Council was split 7 votes to 4 on the
decision to raise domestic fees, with 7 councillors absent
from the meeting.</p>

<p>”The Council has missed a prime
opportunity to send a clear message to the Government that
failure to adequately provide for rising costs is
unacceptable,” said Joe McCrory, Auckland University
Students’ Association (AUSA) President-Elect and student
representative on Council.</p>

<p>“We appreciate that the
university is under severe financial pressure as a direct
result of under funding, but it is not fair that students
bear the burden of government inaction. Skyrocketing tuition
fees and the need to borrow to live means that students have
little choice but to take on a massive student loan, locking
graduates into a lifetime of debt,” said McCrory.</p>

<p>Recent
changes to the Government policy of an Annual Maximum Fee
Movement has heightened the burden on students, allowing
institutions to raise fees by a maximum of 4.0 per cent per
annum, exclusive of GST, which adds a further 2.3 per
cent.</p>

<p>“It is pleasing that some council members joined
the student representatives to vote against the fee
increase,” said McCrory. “The University Council must do
more to acknowledge the financial difficulties faced by
students, and the significant amount of debt many are forced
to take on in pursuit of a degree at the University of
Auckland,” said McCrory.<p>
<p>“There is wide consensus of
opinion that the Government needs to commit to a significant
injection of funding towards the public tertiary education
system. In order for this to happen, however, students,
staff, and institution management needs to work together
collectively. In the interim, students should not shoulder
the burden of under-funding in the sector by being forced to
pay increasing tuition fees,” said McCrory.</p>

<p>“It is
disappointing that the Council has chosen to vote for the
maximum increase possible,” concluded
McCrory.</p>
