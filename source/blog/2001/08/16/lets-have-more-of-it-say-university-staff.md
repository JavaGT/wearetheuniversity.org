<p><br>16 August 2001 <br>Media Release<br>Attention:
Education Reporters</p>

<p><br>Let’s have more of it say
university staff!</p>

<p>Associate Minister of Education, Steve
Maharey’s disclosure in Parliament today, that additional
money recently provided to the public tertiary education
system was money freed by the funding moratorium for private
training establishments, has been welcomed by university
staff.</p>

<p>Association of University Staff [AUS] National
President, Neville Blampied, said in Christchurch today
that, “We see this as a positive step and hope that it
signals further Government commitment to rebuilding New
Zealand’s public tertiary system as its first
priority”.</p>

<p>“Contrary to ACT MP Dr Muriel Newman’s
statement that this is against trends in most OECD
countries, most countries we compare ourselves with are
investing heavily in public tertiary education and in
particular, university education. Canada, the United
Kingdom, Australia and the Republic of Ireland, for example
- are all ahead of New Zealand in the priority they give to
a well-resourced public tertiary education system. These
countries have recognised that it is the university sector
which makes the most critical contribution to knowledge and
innovation” said Neville Blampied.</p>

<p>“A funding crisis is
destroying New Zealand’s university system. Cuts in
essential services such as libraries, run-down facilities,
reductions in teaching contact, cuts in research activity,
unacceptable student:staff ratios, and pay increases for
staff that are perpetually below inflation rates have been
endured for years now. Meantime, public subsidies to private
tertiary providers have increased by over 300% since
1999.”<p>
<p>Neville Blampied continued, “The funding crisis is
still waiting to be seriously addressed by Government and
none of the new money will be available until after 1 July
2002. Nevertheless, unlike ACT’s Dr Newman, we welcome the
redirection of public funds from private training
establishments back to the public sector. <br>Let’s have
more of it!”</p>
