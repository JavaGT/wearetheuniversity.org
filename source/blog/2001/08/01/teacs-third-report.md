RELEASE <br>Attention Education Reporters</p><p>TEAC'S THIRD
REPORT - SMALL STEP IN A STRATEGIC DIRECTION</p><p>Association
of University Staff [AUS] National President, Neville
Blampied, speaking in Christchurch today, welcomed the
Tertiary Education Advisory Commission’s third report. He
said, "We see the report as a welcome affirmation that a
strategic direction is vital for the sector, after more than
a decade in which there was no national vision for tertiary
education, no clear appreciation of what each part of the
sector should be contributing to national development, and
systematic, gross underfunding. AUS also welcomes the
report's clear emphasis on the essential link between
resources and quality, and its recommendation that
government commit to continued and predictable growth in
public investment in the system.”</p><p>“We support the
development of a more differentiated and focused system and
urge the Government to ensure that those mechanisms are
effective enough to rebuild and strengthen the public
tertiary education infrastructure. In a climate of limited
resources, that must be New Zealand’s first
priority.”</p><p>Neville Blampied continued, “We also note the
report’s focus on the ‘two ends of the system’, and support
its emphasis on maintaining and increasing the participation
in tertiary education of those who are currently excluded,
and the need to ensure that New Zealand produces
high-quality, world-class research and scholarship.” He
added that "The focus on the 'two ends' carries with it a
real danger that the heart of the system - programmes
offering first degrees and diplomas - will be neglected.
This must not happen."

<p>He noted that "While the report
makes some useful suggestions about ways in which the
performance of the tertiary education system can be
benchmarked and monitored, there are many issues not
addressed and much essential detail is lacking. There is no
recognition of the need to address the loss of
highly-qualified staff, unrealistic workloads and other
staffing issues directly linked to quality of provision.
Furthermore, there are recommendations, such as the proposal
to 'unbundle' component parts of the education service,
which threaten the professional integrity of academic work.
We oppose such suggestions.”</p><p>“We look forward to TEAC’s
final report, dealing with the fundamental issue of
funding,” said Mr Blampied. “We urge TEAC and the Minister,
Hon Steve Maharey, to ensure that that report also deals
with not only capacity in the system, but also its
capability – the staff -- without which the system is
nothing.”</p><p>Contact:<br>Neville Blampied, 021 680 475, 03
