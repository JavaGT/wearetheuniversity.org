University Staff (AUS) has reacted cautiously to the
announcement that Dr Andrew West is to head the transition
body that will become the Tertiary Education
Commission.</p><p>Speaking in Christchurch today, AUS National
President, Neville Blampied said, that "Dr West is clearly
an eminent scientist and a science manager with wide
experience. His writings indicate a lively interest in
tertiary education issues. Unfortunately, he has little
direct personal knowledge of the New Zealand university
system."</p><p>"AUS welcomes indications that Dr West believes
strongly that public investment in higher education and
research needs to increase sharply. We disagree, however,
with his suggestions that <br>New Zealand’s 8 universities
be merged to 3 and the number of polytechnics be reduced to
‘well below 20’. [NZ Science Review, Vol. 57 (1-2) 2000].
Structural tinkering such as this is no substitute for
sustained, strategic investment,” he said.</p><p>Neville
Blampied added that “This appointment will have a
significant impact on New Zealand’s ability to put into
practice the proposals that have come out of the recent
Knowledge Wave conference. Reversing the damage that the
policies of the past 15 years have done to higher education
in New Zealand must be the Tertiary Education Commission's
foremost task. We will work actively with Dr West to ensure
that New Zealand’s universities become adequately funded so
that they can maintain their international standing and make
their unique contribution to New Zealand culture, society
and economy through their teaching, scholarship and research
efforts.
