underwhelmed by the Government’s announcement of a $34.7
million fund to assist public tertiary education providers
to adapt to a changing environment.  The fund does not come
into effect until 1 July 2002.</p>

<p>Association of University
Staff Executive Director, Rob Crozier, said in Wellington
today that this fund would not do anything to assist
university staff who were finding their salaries and working
conditions to be totally inadequate.</p>

<p>“It is important to
realise that university staff operate in an international
market place and that our salaries and conditions are
uncompetitive.</p>

<p>“New Zealand universities are now extremely
unattractive places for academic and general staff to work
in and the current problems of staff recruitment and
retention require urgent remedial action,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is
deplorable that the Government has precluded university
salaries from being increased in spelling out what this
additional money can be spent on.</p>

<p>“The Association has
embarked on a campaign to seek a better funding regime
specifically for salaries and we believe that
Vice-Chancellors are supportive of this.  In the meantime,
we will be forced to look at ways in which we might make
staff workloads less oppressive – areas such as library
closures at certain times, restricted course offerings,
fewer tutorials, less internal assessment etc.</p>

<p>“If the
Government is serious about the outcomes of the recent
Knowledge Wave Conference, then it has to get real and
acknowledge the vital contribution of the universities’
intellectual capital – their staff,” said Mr
Crozier.</p>
