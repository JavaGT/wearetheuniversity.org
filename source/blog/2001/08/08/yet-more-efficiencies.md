University Staff [AUS] expressed some dismay at the
Government’s tertiary sector efficiency study announced
yesterday. “While we support a focus on identifying and
encouraging collaborative strategies such as shared services
and course delivery/design in the sector,” said Neville
Blampied, AUS National President, “There is a depressing
sense of déjà vu in the focus on finding more efficiencies
in the system”.</p>

<p>Neville Blampied, continued, “The aim to
wring even more efficiencies out of the system is a familiar
one to university staff. It was the justification for the
ill-fated green and white papers of the previous Government.
What is needed now is not more investigation of
efficiencies, but more Government commitment to public
investment, international benchmarking and a sustained
determination to reach essential targets for quality,
participation and research achievement”.</p>

<p>“University staff
have achieved more than a 10% increase in productivity since
1991. This is now saving the university system more than $50
million a year. Despite this, university pay has not even
kept up with inflation since 1991 – and we now have a
two-year, Government-imposed pay freeze in the sector. Staff
are operating in a system that has unacceptably high
student:staff ratios and is 590 academic staff short of
early 1990s staffing levels. Hours of work and workloads are
at unprecedented levels, in a university system that has
already been cut to the bone – and operates at around 60% of
the funding levels of Australian universities.  How much
more efficient can New Zealand universities and their staff
get?!” asked Mr Blampied.</p>
