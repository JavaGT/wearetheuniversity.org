<p>University of Otago staff have today begun an industrial
action campaign following the failure of the University to
table a substantially increased offer at negotiations
yesterday, Tuesday 30 October.</p>

<p>The industrial action
campaign will start with low level actions involving a
poster and sticker campaign, and attending the University
Council meeting on 6 November – building up to the
withholding of exam results and public demonstrations
focused on the December graduation ceremonies.</p>

<p>Combined
Union spokesperson, Jeff Rowe, stated that “The University’s
failure to recognise the value of the work that staff do,
and the recruitment and retention problems that the
University faces leaves members with no other choice than to
begin industrial action. Not only are the salary rates of
members at stake, but also the quality of teaching and
research at this institution.”</p>

<p>Following stop-work
meetings held at Otago University campuses in Wellington,
Christchurch and Dunedin last week, unions representing
academic, general and trades staff re-entered negotiations
with the employer seeking a substantially increased salary
offer. In the event that this was not forthcoming the
meetings had authorised an immediate commencement of an
industrial action campaign.</p>

<p>“That campaign starts today,”
said Mr Rowe.</p>

<p>Further meetings of union
members will be held on 13 and 14 November to discuss
escalation of the
action.<br><p>
