<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Data released recently
by the Government Statistician on the average weekly income
of New Zealanders show a substantial increase in income from
Wages and Salaries in the year to June 2001 â€“ 9% compared
with the previous year. The data show that average weekly
earnings from salary and wages are up 15% on 1998 figures.<p>

<p>Commenting on this data in Christchurch today, AUS
National President Neville Blampied, said "This is good news
for workers, and suggests that New Zealand may be making its
way out of the low-wages path imposed by the Employment
Contracts Act. At the same time, however, the skill margin
for university staff has shrunk by 10% in only four years
(1998 - 2001). University academic staff, who have
doctorates and other advanced qualifications, and who work
at the cutting edge of knowledge development are not getting
the importance of their contribution to the knowledge
society and innovation economy recognised. In fact, the
opposite is happening.  Their relative position in the
economy is deteriorating."</p>

<p>Neville Blampied added "The
worsening position of university staff is especially evident
when year-on-year percentage increases in average weekly pay
and university pay are compared. Whereas, average pay is now
15% up on 1998 rates, pay for university teachers has
increased by only 4% since 1998.  The increase was little
more than 1% for university staff in 2001 versus 9% for the
average worker."<p>
<p>"Finally," Neville Blampied noted, "even
if university staff achieved the 8% pay rise they are
claiming this year (less than the rise in average pay
2000-2001), their pay would be up only 12% over 1998, not
the 15% by which average wages and salaries have increased
in that period."</p>

<p>Neville Blampied attributes this
deteriorating pattern in university pay to the complete
failure of the current bargaining mechanisms for university
salary setting. "New Zealand university pay rates are not
only completely uncompetitive relative to international pay
for highly qualified knowledge workers, they are
increasingly uncompetitive relative to the rest of the New
Zealand economy. It's not surprising that numerous
university departments teeter on the brink of collapse as
they struggle to fill vacancies with suitably qualified
people. The situation will go on getting worse until the
Government, the Vice-Chancellors and AUS are able to sit
down and plan a rational and fair wage setting mechanism for
the sector" he said.</p>
