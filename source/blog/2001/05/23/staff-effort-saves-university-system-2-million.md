         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>In the current issue of
New Zealand Education Review, AUS National President Neville
Blampied examines the financial impact of the changing ratio
of academic staff between 1991 and 1999.</p><p>Neville Blampied
said that during this period (1991 to1999) the ratio of
Academic Staff to Students (measured in Full-time
equivalents) deteriorated from 1:17 to 1:19. “This may seem
a modest change, but the implications are very significant
and surprising” he said.</p><p>“Our analysis shows that :</p><p>1.
By 1999, the NZ university system was 590 staff short of the
number needed to maintain the 1:17 ratio – a number roughly
equivalent to the academic staff numbers at Waikato
University or the University of Canterbury.  The system has
thus absorbed the workload equivalent of an entire
university.</p><p>2. Being 590 staff short currently saves the
university system over $40Million per annum in direct costs.
This is a larger amount than the additional funding
universities received in 2001.  Every year at the current
staff:student ratio continues this saving. </p><p>3. The
additional work done by academic staff meeting this
shortfall in staff amounted to more than 3000 person-years,
or more than 7.5 million hours of work.</p><p>4. The economic
value of this extra work easily exceeds $200 Million since
1991. This takes into account only salary savings on the
staff not otherwise employed, and excludes superannuation,
other direct staff costs, and associated operating and
capital costs. It also does not include any estimate of the
savings due to not having to employ additional general staff
to complement the work of academic staff.

<p>5. The extra
staff work has saved students at least $66 Million in extra
fees.”</p><p>Neville Blampied added that “since 1991, staff
salaries have not even kept up with inflation, and staff
have received neither overtime nor bonuses. There has been
no compensation for increases in productivity. Throughout
this time staff have been constantly faced with
restructuring, redundancies and constant reductions in
university funding. Current government plans for the sector
will make the situation even worse for staff during 2001 and
2002.”</p><p></p><p>Contact Neville Blampied – 021 680 475. Or 03
