<p>“Students are in a no win situation under
the Government Fees deal rumoured to be in tomorrow’s
budget,” said Auckland University Students Association
President, Kane Stanford.</p>

<p>“The Fees Deal was supposed to
be a one off option for last year but the Government seems
to be content to continue a legacy of underfunding
universities and increasing tuition fees just like it’s
predecessors,” said Stanford.</p>

<p>“If the Universities takes
the fees deal, students face larger classes, fewer library
resources, and less investment in plant and equipment. If
the Universities do not take the fee offer, then Auckland
University students face fee rises of between $400 and
$2500. This a completely unacceptable situation.”</p>

<p>“If the Government is truly committed to New Zealand
becoming a knowledge society, then it should ensure that
high quality, low cost education is available to every New
Zealander,” concluded Mr
Stanford.</p>
