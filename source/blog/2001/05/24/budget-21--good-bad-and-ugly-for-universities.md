         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Speaking in Wellington
today after the presentation of the Government’s 2001
Budget, Association of University Staff (AUS) National
President, Neville Blampied, said that “there are some
positive features of the Budget for universities, but these
are overshadowed by the inadequate funding provided for the
sector in the fees stabilisation deal”.</p><p>Speaking of the
good, Neville Blampied said that the AUS particularly
welcomed the extension of the Ombudsman’s office to cover
complaints from students. “This establishes a respected, and
independent mechanism for resolving complaints about
Universities. We support this development.” </p><p>He added that
AUS also welcomed the confirmation that the Tertiary
Education Commission would be set up, although there is
little detail yet of its powers and responsibilities.
Neville Blampied also praised the innovation of establishing
Tertiary Teaching Awards. “These prestigious and valuable
awards (four annually, each worth $50,000) will go someway
to recognising the high quality of teaching in the tertiary
sector which currently goes largely unrecognised and
unrewarded. AUS looks forwards to being involved in the
process of setting up and administering these awards,” he
said.</p><p>Neville Blampied also commented that “In a Budget in
which references to knowledge and innovation are relatively
sparse, university staff commend the Government for
increasing the Marsden Fund for excellent research by $2M,
although it is regrettable that the overall increase in
research and development funding overall is a modest
$11.6M”

<p>“Against these positive initiatives, must be set
the bad features of the fees stabilisation proposal, and the
ugliness of the coercive tactics being used to induce
institutions to accept it. The extra money being put up by
the Government to compensate universities for holding fees
at 2000 levels is woefully inadequate, and at $36.9M is less
than the annual contribution of more than $40M made by staff
accepting the higher workloads imposed since 1999. The
meagre level of the government’s offer will make it
impossible for any institution that accepts the offer to
maintain the quality of the education it provides, and NZ
universities will put their international reputations at
risk.”</p><p>“The Government itself clearly recognises that its
offer is inadequate. That is why they have resorted to the
deplorably coercive tactic of linking acceptance of the fees
stabilisation deal with access to the Centres of Research
Excellence funding,” said Neville Blampied. </p><p>“There is no
principled reason why Centres of Research Excellence should
be linked to fees in this way, and it is clear the
Government feared that the merits of the stabilisation offer
alone would not induce universities to accept it. We think
that this is a tactic of which the Government should be
ashamed, and AUS calls on the Ministers involved to break
the link between these two line items. </p><p>Making progress on
the foundations of the knowledge society and innovation
economy should not be subject to petty politics,” he
said.</p><p></p><p>Contact:		Neville Blampied   021 680
