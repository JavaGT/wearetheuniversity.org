review PTE funding </p><p>The Association of University Staff
(AUS) has today joined in calls for the Government to act
urgently to redirect tuition subsidies provided to private
training establishments (PTEs) back to the public tertiary
education sector.</p><p>AUS National President, Neville
Blampied, said in Christchurch today that the Associate
Minister of Education (Tertiary), the Hon Steve Maharey, had
given an assurance in December 1999 that he would review the
level of Government subsidy for students in PTEs.</p><p>“At that
time, he stated that he would review the system through
which PTEs received the same tuition subsidies as public
tertiary institutions and ‘put something else in place in
2001’.</p><p>“What the Minister could immediately put in place,
as a matter of both fundamental principle and good practice,
given the Government’s tight fiscal position, is to remove
the capital component from the tuition subsidies provided to
PTEs.  AUS estimates this will free up almost $20m in 2002
and would provide significant extra funds for the public
tertiary sector,” he said.</p><p>“PTEs receive the same funds
per equivalent full-time student (EFTS) as do public
tertiary institutions, and this includes a taxpayer-funded
contribution to capital costs.  In 1999, PTEs received
public funding of $16.8m in respect of 9187 EFTS.  This year
the Ministry of Education estimates that PTEs will get
$128.4m in respect of 21091 EFTS.  This is a funding
increase of 664% compared with an increase in funded student
places of 130%.

<p>“This stupendous increase have come at a
time when the public tertiary institutions have come under
serious funding pressure.  The stress that last year’s 2.3%
increase in funding in exchange for a tuition fee freeze has
placed on public tertiary institutions, including
universities, has been enormous and has led to dangerous
cuts in teaching provision, library resources, and research
funding, and has maintained cut-throat competition among
institutions.</p><p>Neville Blampied added that “There is a myth
abroad that cutting funding to PTEs would impact
detrimentally on Maori and Pacific students.  However, the
facts don’t stack up.</p><p>“In 1999, there were 27,837 Maori
EFTS in public tertiary institutions and 9,093 in PTEs.  The
comparable numbers for Pacific students were 8,241 and 2,908
respectively.</p><p>“Given that the vast majority of students
(including Maori and Pacific students) study in the public
tertiary sector, a Government genuinely concerned for these
students would ensure that its funding policies are not
damaging public institutions.  Returning the capital
payments from PTEs  to the public sector would be a tangible
demonstration of the Government’s commitment to public
tertiary education which has so far been conspicuously
lacking,” he said.</p><p><br>Contact details for Neville
