Tertiary Education (ASTE), Association of University Staff
(AUS) and Technical Institutes’ Allied Staff Association
(TIASA) met in Wellington today and agreed to create a new
formal entity – the Council of Unions in Tertiary Education
(CUTE).</p>

<p>Leaders of the three unions said that the aim of
CUTE was to provide a forum for discussing issues of general
concern to all staff in the tertiary education
sector.</p>

<p>“This is an important development in light of the
future engagement that tertiary sector staff envisage with
the proposed Tertiary Education Commission.</p>

<p>“CUTE, which
will be made up of the Presidents and General Secretaries of
the three unions will meet on a regular basis during 2001
and 2002.  Its future will be reviewed in 2003,” they
said.<br><p>
