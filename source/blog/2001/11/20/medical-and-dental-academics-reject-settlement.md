Academic staff members of AUS employed by the University of
Otago have voted to reject the salary offer made by their
employer.</p>

<p>The offer was the same as that made to (and
rejected by) other University of Otago staff – a 2% lump sum
payment with a further 2% to be added to salaries in
February 2002.</p>

<p>The AUS advocate for the negotiations,
Marty Braithwaite, said that the offer was regarded by
members as “woefully inadequate”.<p>

<p>“The Vice-Chancellor
has acknowledged that there are serious problems with
recruitment and retention in this area but has done nothing
to address this issue with the offer he has made” said Mr
Braithwaite.</p>

<p>It is expected that the Medical/Dental staff
will now join with their colleagues in a programme of
industrial action in pursuit of a better settlement.</p>
