Hokowhitu and Turitea campuses at Massey University voted by
an overwhelming majority to begin open-ended and escalating
industrial action today. This follows a similar result at
Albany campus last Friday.</p><p>The vote was in response to the
employer's refusal to address staff concerns with
increasingly unmanageable workloads, the casualisation of
permanent staff positions and a 1.8% pay offer, which is
less than the current inflation rate.</p><p>"The mood of the
meeting was very unified, positive and strong.  Our decision
to start our industrial campaign, which includes withholding
grades, will send a concerted message to our employer.  It
is now up to him to really start addressing our serious
concerns," said Combined Union Team Spokesperson, Jan
McPherson.</p><p>"There was a lot of discussion around the issue
of withholding grades and this is to be expected because
staff are always concerned at the effect our actions could
potentially have on our students.  Staff appreciated the
support MUSA President, Huia Welton, gave us at our meeting
today.  Huia appreciated, as the majority of our students
do, that the well-being of staff greatly affects the quality
of the education we can provide.  Huia was warmly received
by the staff at the stopwork meeting and we thank her and
her colleagues at MUSA for their support," said Jan
McPherson.

<p>"The decision to withhold grades will be
revisited at further stopwork meetings held across the
campuses on the 10th and 11th of December.  It is at this
time that members will also be asked to discuss and vote on
the possibility of strike action for the beginning of
Semester One 2002.  We will make this plan known to the
employer's negotiating team who we are making arrangements
to meet after the final stopwork meeting is held at
Wellington tomorrow," said Combined Union Spokesperson Peter
Blakey.</p><p>For further comment please contact:<br>Peter
