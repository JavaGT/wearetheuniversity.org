University Staff (AUS) has cautiously welcomed the 4th
report of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC)
– released in Wellington today.</p>

<p>AUS National President,
Neville Blampied, said in Wellington today that the
Association considered that TEAC’s recommendation that there
be a review of the various cost categories which establish
the basis on which institutions are funded was an absolute
imperative for the Government.</p>

<p>“The categories were
established at the beginning of the 1990s and have been cut
regularly since then,” said Mr Blampied.</p>

<p>“It is an
acknowledged fact that these cuts have resulted in a fall in
the value of course funding of more than 20% in real terms
over the past decade.  There is a need to inject substantial
new resources into tertiary education in New Zealand if we
are to catch the knowledge wave.</p>

<p>“It is vitally
important, therefore, for the Government to commit itself to
giving this review priority and commencing it as soon as is
practicable.  In our view, this task could begin immediately
under the supervision of the Transition Tertiary Education
Commission,” he said.</p>

<p>“Finally, we warmly congratulate the
Commission for recognising the importance of staff in the
tertiary sector – a welcome change after a decade of neglect
by previous Governments.”</p>
