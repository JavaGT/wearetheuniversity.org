<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>At a meeting held today
Victoria University staff resolved to step up their
industrial campaign, in response to an unacceptable 1.8%
salary offer and the continuing erosion of staff employment
conditions. This action includes delaying the submission of
student grades, the withdrawal of goodwill, and holding a
stopwork meeting scheduled for December 13th. Staff also
voted to escalate industrial action until their claims were
settled.</p>

<p>Reece Walters, AUS Campaign Co-ordinator, said
"Staff at Victoria University are angry. The outcome of this
meeting sends a clear message to Victoria University's
Vice-Chancellor and the government that our staff mean
business."</p>

<p>A boycott of the December graduation ceremony
was seriously discussed at the meeting. This was put aside
in favour of attending the graduation ceremony en
masse.</p>

<p>Reece Walters commented: "This action sends two
messages. First, to our students, that we are proud of and
committed to them. And secondly, a large staff presence at
graduation will serve to publicly state our opposition to
Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon as well as Steve Maharey
for their failure to value university staff."</p>

<p>Future
industrial actions will also include picketing and
petitioning. Staff will further discuss the likelihood of
strike action at the stopwork meeting on December
13th.</p>
