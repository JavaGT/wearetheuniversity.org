leading the way in the industrial action campaign that is
building up following the breakdown of collective agreement
negotiations. As one of the first steps in an escalating
plan of action, Lincoln academic members of the Association
of University Staff (AUS) agreed to withhold second semester
examination results for one week.</p>

<p>This low-level action,
part of an escalating campaign, was primarily intended to
let management know the extent of feeling among staff
members. The results have shown that there is outstanding
support for the campaign among the academic staff.<p>

<p>After
the November 2 deadline, 80% of undergraduate results were
missing from the database, said Lincoln AUS branch president
Jim McAloon.<p>

<p>"While some may have tried to downplay the
effect of the proposed action, to find such unity among
academic staff sends a very strong message to management" Dr
McAloon said.</p>

<p>Action committees at other universities were
"delighted" to hear of the overwhelming support by Lincoln
academics for the campaign. Along with the other New Zealand
universities, AUS members at Lincoln will hold a stop work
meeting in December to agree on further action which is set
to escalate rapidly in the first semester
2002.</p>
