under increasing pressure from staff and students to settle
the current pay dispute at Massey.  Massey management has
come under pressure since the combined union's decision last
week to undertake lawful industrial action by withholding
grades from the administration.</p>

<p>"Since we have taken this
decision there has been a lot of discussion among union
members about the importance of not disadvantaging
individual students as part of the action.  This dialogue
has been positive and our official exemptions process is now
up and running. At present, for most students, the
withholding of grades represents an inconvenience – nothing
more.  We urge student leaders to see the important
distinction between real long term 'disadvantage' and a
short term 'inconvenience' and to keep talking with us" said
Combined Union Spokesperson Peter Blakey.</p>

<p>"The reaction
from particular members of Massey Senior Management has been
less than constructive and it’s a shame that they have not
been able to appreciate just how flexible union members are
willing to be with this low-level action.  That type of
response just serves to strengthen the resolve of our
members.  We would encourage management to sit down with
Union representatives to go through the ins and outs of this
lawful action – it is after all the responsibility of
management to come up with contingency plans for students. 
We suggest the easiest way to achieve this is to provide us
with a fair and decent wage offer for this year," said
Combined Union Spokesperson Jan McPherson.<p>
<p>"The issues
facing staff at Massey and other Universities are serious! 
We don't believe that students, or the quality of the
teaching and research we can provide, will be well served in
the future by staff continuing to accept less than inflation
increases which are, in reality, pay cuts!  We don't believe
that our students will be served well by management which
refuses to attempt to address the deterioration of working
conditions at Massey and the increasingly heavy workloads of
staff.  Finally, we don't believe that our students will
want to see the hours of work provision extended so that our
general staff can be required to work earlier, later, longer
and on the weekend!  Unfortunately, this is the alternative
to our industrial action and it isn't an alternative that we
are willing to accept," said Jan McPherson.</p>

<p>"We agree with
the students that it is management that needs to do more to
settle the dispute, however we also believe it is the
University Council's responsibility to show a long-term
commitment to staff and some evidence of strategic financial
planning which prioritises issues important to staff.  And
of course the government needs to make this process easier
by funding universities adequately!  We therefore urge the
student representatives who are members of University
Council to take this issue up at that level," said Peter
Blakey.</p>
