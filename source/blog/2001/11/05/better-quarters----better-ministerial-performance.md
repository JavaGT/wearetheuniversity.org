<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Speaking in Christchurch
today, AUS National President Neville Blampied,
congratulated Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey on
moving into a stylish and sophisticated new office in the
Beehive. Neville Blampied said that he was sure that the new
environment would mean a great improvement in the Minister’s
working life.</p>

<p>On behalf of 6000 AUS members, Neville
Blampied asked Minister Maharey to compare his situation
with that faced by university staff. “The Minister can enjoy
the benefits of a $30M, tax-payer funded renovation, without
that expenditure having had any influence on the pay rises
he has enjoyed each year he has been an MP and Minister. In
contrast, university staff for more than a decade, have
faced a rigorous trade-off: Every dollar spent on improving
university working conditions has reduced money available
for fair pay rises for staff. That is why university pay has
fallen more than 10% behind inflation, while MPs pay has
risen much faster than inflation. So far, the Minister has
strongly supported this policy.”</p>

<p>Neville Blampied added
that he hoped that the quality of the Minister’s new office
would inspire some quality decision-making by the Minister
on the Tertiary Education Commission’s 4th report on funding
tertiary education. He added that “The new funding model
must ensure that funding for physical capital is separated
from funding for human capital (staff). In the long run, it
is the quality of the staff that matters most in maintaining
university education of international
standard.”</p>
