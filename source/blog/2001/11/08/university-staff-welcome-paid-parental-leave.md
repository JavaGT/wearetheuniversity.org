<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Association of
University Staff [AUS] Women’s Vice-President, Mary Cain, in
<br>Christchurch today, welcomed the Government’s
announcement on paid parental <br>leave.   “This is a very
positive first step towards what is accepted as standard
practice <br>in most other countries and is an important
victory for New Zealand women and <br>their families,” said
Mary Cain, AUS Women’s Vice-President.<p>

<p>“To be
competitive in an international labour market context, New
Zealand must be seen as a country that offers a high quality
working life and enlightened working conditions.<p>

<p>“Over
120 countries already provide for paid parental leave – we
need now to build on the current welcome initiative and meet
the International Labour Organisation requirement of 14
weeks paid leave as soon as possible,” continued Ms
Cain.</p>

<p>“AUS will continue to work with other unions and
community groups towards that end – and at the same time
will be seeking to achieve this for our members through
collective agreements with our
employers.”</p>
