Higher Salaries Commission to MPs is a particularly bitter
pill for university staff to swallow, given that at one
time, the HSC also determined university academic staff
pay.</p><p>Speaking in Wellington today, Neville Blampied,
Association of University Staff (AUS) National President,
said that since 1990, university staff pay had not even kept
up with inflation. “If the HSC had done no more than adjust
academic pay for inflation over the past ten years,
university staff would have collectively received $50
million more in their pay packets than they have received”
he said. “The gap between actual pay and what it would be if
adjusted for inflation is now running at about $18M per
annum.”</p><p>The AUS pointed out that until the late 1980s, the
pay of a career-grade senior lecturer was benchmarked to
that of a back-bench MP.  In 1990, base pay for an MP was
$63,500. That of a career-grade senior lecturer was $61,000.
In 2001, the senior lecturer is receiving $70,200 while the
MP’s salary has risen to $90,500.</p><p>Neville Blampied
added that “There is overwhelming evidence that university
pay has fallen well behind rates paid in both public and
private sector in New Zealand, and is severely uncompetitive
with overseas salaries. </p><p>“The AUS believes that an
independent review of university pay levels and structures
is urgently needed.  We support the Tertiary Education
Commission’s recommendation [#23 in the TEAC 4th Report]
that a review of staff salaries and conditions be
undertaken. </p><p>“This should be a top priority for 2002”, he
said.</p><p><br>Contact Neville Blampied on 03 3642199 (wk) or
