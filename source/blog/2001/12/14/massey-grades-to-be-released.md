negotiators have today sent a message to union members
authorising the release of grades following the receipt of
an improved offer from management in the areas of salary,
casualisation and workloads.</p>

<p>The willingness of the
employer to return to the negotiating table over the last
two days has been welcomed by union staff at Massey.<p>

<p>"The
main improvements include the reduction of the period in
which staff are truly casual.  This change will
significantly increase the number of staff eligible for
coverage of our collective agreement, and the terms and
conditions contained within it.  Needless to say, this will
mean a number of significant improvements to the current
working conditions for the large number of casual members of
staff" said Combined Union Spokesperson</p>

<p>"Employer has
demonstrated a real commitment to working with union
representatives to ensure that all staff have safe and
reasonable workloads.  These workloads will be closely
monitored by a joint union/employer team"<p>

<p>"The most
significant improvement in the salary offer was the
commitment to apply the increases to printed salary scales
for general staff.  This has been a bone of contention for a
number of years.  In addition the previous 1% one-off lump
sum payment will be applied as an across the board increase
on the printed and paid rates for all staff in April 2002. 
There is also a commitment to pass on any additional
government funding over a certain percent to staff in 2003"
said Peter Blakey<p>
<p>"Perhaps one of the most important
commitments for our university in the long term is the
establishment of joint union/employer taskforces which will
make specific recommendations for improved salary levels and
related staff development opportunities.  The work of these
taskforces will inform the university's financial planning
for the medium to long term" said Peter Blakey</p>

<p>"In
addition we will co ordinate the formation of a National
University Academic Staff Coalition comprising equal
representation from unions and employers.  This coalition
would seek, among other things, to develop international
benchmarking of academic salaries, opportunities and
performance in teaching and research; advocate directly to
Government to achieve international competitiveness of
salaries and conditions for academic staff" said Peter
Blakey</p>

<p>"We are concerned that the release of grades will
put pressure on support staff who now have the unenviable
task of processing the large number of outstanding grades
before Christmas and are pleased with the assurance that no
undue pressure will be put on general staff.  We have been
told that extra resources will be made available to
departments who need additional support" said Peter
Blakey.</p>

<p>"The negotiating team judged that this improved
offer warranted a good will gesture from union members and
so we have authorised the release of grades.  This improved
offer will now form the basis of further negotiations in the
New Year" said Peter Blakey.</p>
