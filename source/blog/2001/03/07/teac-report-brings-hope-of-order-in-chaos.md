<p>“We can all hope that the recommendations of the TEAC report
will return sanity to Tertiary Education,” said Auckland
University Students Association Education Vice- President,
Stephanie Thompson, today.</p>

<p>“For over a decade institutions
have been financially rewarded for going into direct
competition with each other. This has ultimately been a
waste of both taxpayer and student funds,” said Ms Thompson.
“In a small country like New Zealand, that is economic
suicide.”</p>

<p>“Clearly, the secret to success in a modern
economy is through a rational and planned approach to the
provision of Tertiary Education, for which this report lays
down the foundations”</p>

<p>While the TEAC report sets out a
pathway for sensible reforms these will all be in vain if
the Government does address levels of funding in Tertiary
Education.<p>

<p>“You cannot expect the Tertiary education
sector to perform like a BMW when the funds only allow for a
Mini,” concluded Ms Thompson.</p>
