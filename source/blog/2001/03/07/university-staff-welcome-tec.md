the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission that the
Government should move to establish a permanent body to be
responsible for the co-ordination of tertiary education in
New Zealand was welcomed today by university staff.</p>

<p>The
National President of the Association of University Staff,
Neville Blampied, said in Wellington today that the move to
establish a permanent autonomous Tertiary Education
Commission was warmly welcomed as this had been on the
Association’s lobbying agenda since the abolition of the
University Grants Committee in 1990.</p>

<p>While expressing
support for the general direction of the TEAC report, Mr
Blampied expressed concern at the likely timetable for
implementation of the recommendation to establish a
permanent commission.</p>

<p>“We are unlikely to see any
realistic improvement in overall funding levels until
academic year 2003.  For a system in crisis this is
intolerable.</p>

<p>“The time for the Government to rely on the
three Rs – Rhetoric, Reviews and Reports – is at an end.  If
the Government is to advance its vision of New Zealand
becoming a knowledge society and innovation-based economy
then three Cs are required – courage, commitment and cash –
and the most important right now is cash”, he
said.</p>
