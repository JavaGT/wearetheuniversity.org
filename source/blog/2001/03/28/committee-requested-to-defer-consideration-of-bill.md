<p>28 March 2001</p>

<p>Select Committee requested to defer
consideration of Bill</p>

<p>Representatives of the Association
of University Staff (AUS) told the Education and Science
Select Committee in Wellington today that the Education
Amendment (No.2) Bill posed the greatest threat to the
distinctive role of universities since the tertiary
education reforms of 1989-90.</p>

<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob
Crozier, noted that the tertiary sector section of the Bill
was heavily preoccupied with financial ‘risk’, yet ‘risk’
was nowhere defined.</p>

<p>“The proposed legislation gives the
Minister of Education the right to dissolve a University
Council and replace it with a Commissioner,” said Mr
Crozier.</p>

<p>“The concept of having one person running a
university with total responsibility for all academic
matters in addition to financial is mind-boggling.</p>

<p>“The
recently-completed report of the Tertiary Education Advisory
Commission, Shaping the System 7.3.01) was released
subsequent to the Bill’s introduction.  This report calls
for …a substantive review…of the tertiary education
provisions of the Education Act 1989…with the object of
improving the coherence and comprehensibility of these
provisions.</p>

<p>“AUS therefore urges the Select Committee to
defer consideration of those clauses of the Bill that have
the potential to allow for political interference in the
administration of universities pending a full and
comprehensive review later this year or next,” said Mr
Crozier.</p>
