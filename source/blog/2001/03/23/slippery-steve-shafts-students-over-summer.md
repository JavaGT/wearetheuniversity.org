<p>“The Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary) obviously
thinks that students are stupid, if he thinks that students
will believe his claims that the Labour Government has made
their situation in summer any better than under National”
said Auckland University Students’ Association Education
Vice-President, Stephanie Thompson, today.</p>

<p>“The Minister
seems to think that by increasing the numbers of students on
the exceptional circumstances benefit, he has made up for
National’s ‘mean spirited attack’ on students. However this
is not the case,” said Ms Thompson.<p>

<p>“While the Minister
should be congratulated for improving the processing of
benefits, the question remains over why the majority of
students, who do not qualify for allowances, are able to
access money to live on through student loans scheme during
term time and then are supposed to rely on the financial
ability and goodwill of their parents to support them during
summer should they not find a job,” said Ms
Thompson.</p>

<p>“Students like any other group in society
deserve a safety net, however the Minister is happy for
nearly 75% of Auckland University students to fall through
the gaps during the summer, which is not something the
Government should be delivering for students at all,”
concluded Ms
Thompson.</p>
