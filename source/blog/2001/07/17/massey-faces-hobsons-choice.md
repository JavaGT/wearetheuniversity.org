University Staff (AUS) think Massey is damned if it takes
the government's 'fees freeze' offer and damned if it
doesn't.  Each University Council has until 31 August to
accept or reject the Government's budget offer to
Universities.</p>

<p>"Now that our Vice-Chancellor is on public
record as saying the Government offer means either
increasing student fees by 27% or cutting $11.5 million in
expenditure for 2002, AUS foresees a year of staff and
student unrest at Massey campuses," said AUS Massey Branch
President, Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>

<p>"Our past experience, if the
choice means cuts, shows that those cuts will come primarily
from the Palmerston North campuses which have already seen
three years of steady staff cuts.  Massey is bleeding.  That
means students are bleeding too and will bleed more if the
choice is a fee rise to them," said Dr Rhodes.</p>

<p>"Students
are already overburdened with debt and having to take
part-time jobs in order to study; staff have for years been
absorbing higher workloads with fewer resources.  With staff
pay not even meeting inflation over the last ten years much
less keeping pace with international colleagues, is it any
wonder we are asking the Government to join with staff,
students and management in some compromise to their funding
offer?" said Dr Rhodes.</p>
