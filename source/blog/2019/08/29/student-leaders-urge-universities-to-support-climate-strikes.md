<p>President of the Lincoln University
Students’ Association Kristy Havill also provided direct
written support to NZUSA, saying “The Lincoln University
Students’ Association have a cooperative and constructive
working relationship with the Vice-Chancellor. We are
working together to achieve the common goal of making our
campus more environmentally friendly, and we are supportive
of participation in the Climate Strike on Friday 27
September”.</p>

<p><i>The global climate strikes are the third
round of climate related strikes in New Zealand this year
and are set for the 27th September. Organisers are widening
the focus beyond school students, welcoming and encouraging
all groups and individuals to stand for urgent climate
action.</i></p>
