         </p><p></p><p>Today, student associations from around the country
have called on Vice Chancellors’ and Chief Executives from
their respective institutions to pledge support for the
Strike 4 Climate (S4C) day of action on September
27th.</p><p>Across Aotearoa a movement has been growing of
school students demanding urgent action on climate change.
The time has come for the rest of New Zealand to respond to
this call. </p><p>“We will be standing with school students to
fight for our futures, and we want our tertiary institutions
to stand alongside us.” says NZUSA President, James
Ranstead.</p><p>“We are studying to prepare ourselves to be
the leaders of tomorrow. If we don’t act now we won’t
have a future, and will inherit the cost of todays inaction.
There is no better way our tertiary institutions can help us
prepare for the future than by helping to ensure we steer
ourselves away from a path of climate
catastrophe.”</p><p>Associations have sent letters, calling on
their Vice Chancellors, lecturers, and other staff to join
them for the Strike 4 Climate on September 27th. The letters
have also requested that individual institutes issue a
statement in support of the strike, and to enable staff and
students to attend the Strike 4 Climate by whatever means
they can make available.</p><p>“It’s a no brainer – the
Climate crisis is, as the UN says, the defining issue of our
times” said President of the Auckland University
Students’ Association George Barton.</p><p>“The generation
who will most feel the consequences of inaction – those in
primary, intermediate and secondary schools – are standing
up and its only right that we join with them as we too will
inherit the consequences of inaction if nothing happens.
AUSA and our association Faculty, School and Representative
Student Groups are going to support the strike, and our open
letter to the Vice Chancellor calls on Professor McCutcheon
to do the same, and to sit down with us to discuss how the
University of Auckland can fulfil its role to address this
climate crisis”.

<p>President of the Lincoln University
Students’ Association Kristy Havill also provided direct
written support to NZUSA, saying “The Lincoln University
Students’ Association have a cooperative and constructive
working relationship with the Vice-Chancellor. We are
working together to achieve the common goal of making our
campus more environmentally friendly, and we are supportive
of participation in the Climate Strike on Friday 27
September”.</p><p><i>The global climate strikes are the third
round of climate related strikes in New Zealand this year
and are set for the 27th September. Organisers are widening
the focus beyond school students, welcoming and encouraging
all groups and individuals to stand for urgent climate
action.</i></p><p></p><p><br>ends
