<p>The time to act around the gender pay imbalance is now. The
development of a new tertiary education strategy and the
reform of vocational education are perfect opportunities for
the government and tertiary education leaders to take
action, says the Tertiary Education Union | Te Hautū
Kahurangi.</p>

<p>Statistics New Zealand has today released
figures on the gender pay imbalance which has been
unchanged since 2017 .</p>

<p>TEU’s Women’s Officer,
Suzanne McNabb, says the time for talking and debating the
cause of the unfairness between the median hourly earnings
for men and women is over.</p>

<p>“The good work of unions has
seen the gender wage imbalance in the average wage close by
2 percentage points to 11.9%. But sadly <strong>the
imbalance in the median wage is 9.3% percent in the June
quarter – the same as it was two years ago. </strong>We
can only fix this if we work together. We need all workers,
leaders in government, and employers to take action now,”
says McNabb.</p>

<p>This means TEU members need to sign up to keep the pressure
on the government to meet their commitments to deliver
good equal pay legislation that will ensure all working
people are paid fairly.</p>

<p>McNabb says “It also means the
Minister of Education, Chris Hipkins, committing to gender
pay principles and pay equity in the major reforms of the
tertiary education sector.”</p>

<p>“There has been a strong
drive for good gender pay laws which we will continue to
work with other workers to deliver, but we don’t have to
wait for better laws to be passed to do the right thing in
the tertiary education sector. We can act
now.”</p><p>
