<p>Regardless of the medium to long term
certainty, NZUSA recognises there will be some angst amongst
students on the changes soon to come. The Minister has
confirmed that for those students currently studying, there
will be no or minor changes to their programme of study. For
those students soon to begin studying, the qualifications on
offer to them may differ, and likely be reduced.</p>

<p>‘We
believe that these changes are overall a step in the right
direction, however students need to be shown transparency
and given certainty as early as possible on their programmes
of study, and a smooth transition for students should be the
number one goal for any decision maker in this space. This
includes students from a variety of backgrounds, including
international students who are still solely being labelled
as a ‘market’ ’– said Ranstead.</p>

<p>Todays’
announcement from the Minister has been very high level, and
while NZUSA respects the decision for the transition board
to work out much of the granular detail over time, the board
should not underestimate the importance of responding to the
RoVE student wishlist.</p>

<p>‘There hasn't yet been any
clarity on how a seamless transition (particularly in
regards to students programme of study) from the current old
model to the new model will be ensured. Whilst mention of
the democratic structures are a plus, there is yet to be any
certainty of students association resourcing, or the return
of student services reflective of the pre-VSM era. Finally,
we are also yet to hear about the Youth Guarantee CSSF
payment exclusion, and the national centre for student
voice. There are moves to fulfill 5/10 of our RoVE student
wishlist, and the transition council can be assured that
students will be putting on the pressure on these issues
over the next 8 months.’ – said
Ranstead.</p>

<p><strong>Reform of Vocational Education Student
Wishlist 2019:</strong></p>

<p>1.	Ensuring provision is localised
in regions that need it, regardless of the population size
(bums on seats) that currently drives provision
levels.</p>

<p>2.	Well supported RoVE transitions that maintain
and enhance educational quality and learner
experience.</p>

<p>3.	A seamless transition from education to
employment, regardless of student background and
qualification.</p>

<p>4.	Independent students associations as
opposed to student councils supported, with a guaranteed
level of resourcing. This is in contrast to the current
piecemeal system, leaving some institutes with no student
voice whatsoever</p>

<p>5.	Adequate on campus student services
reflective of the pre-Voluntary Student Membership era, with
a special emphasis on mental health services</p>

<p>6.	Youth
Guarantee Compulsory Student Services Fee (CSSF) payment
exclusion covered by parent institute</p>

<p>7.	Organisational
structure and education that is flexible (e.g. blended
learning) to suit the 21st century student, meanwhile
avoiding online learning being used a crux</p>

<p>8.	A National
Center for Student Voice that enhances student voice
capacity, quality and relationships.</p>

<p>9.	Enhanced support
for diverse learners (particularly Māori and Pasifika),
including the incorporation of different worldviews into
what is currently a homogenised western structure and way of
educating</p>

<p>10.	Free Tertiary Education, or at the very
least the continued roll-out of the coalition Government’s
Fees Free
Policy</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
