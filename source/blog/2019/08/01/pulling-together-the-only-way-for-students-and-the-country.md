         <strong>TEU Media Release.</strong></p><p>1st August
2019</p><p><strong>Pulling together the only way now for the
sake of students and the country</strong></p><p></p><p><br>The
announcement today that the government will proceed with
unifying the vocational education and training sector will
only succeed if the promise to recognise academic, general,
and allied staff as sector experts and leaders is
implemented fully.</p><p>TEU National Secretary Sharn Riggs says
“Students, communities, staff, and employers have been
impacted under a decade of uncertainty and underfunding with
divisive policies in tertiary education pitting polytechnics
against private training establishments, industry trainers
and against each other. This divisiveness ends with the
today’s announcement.”</p><p>“Now staff, students,
community, iwi, and industry leaders need to pull together
for the good of our country.”</p><p>Riggs says that while
there was no accepted single way for this sector to be
brought together, there is little doubt that most staff
wanted an end to the free market approach to education which
saw retrenchment of education opportunities in many
communities.</p><p>TEU is pleased to see that there will be a
charter that sets down everyone’s responsibility to ensure
regional and metropolitan communities have access to
vocational education and training in what the Minister has
said will be a “coherent and coordinated national
system”. “Students, their whanau, communities, industry,
and employers need to know there is a stable baseline of
provision wherever you live,” says Riggs, “this is what
has been missing up until now and what a coordinated system
can deliver.”

<p>TEU Vice President Sarah Proctor-Thomson
says a major win has been the decision to legislate roles
for staff, students, and communities in creating the future
of vocational education. “For over a decade many staff and
students have felt under-valued and ignored by their senior
leadership. They have often seen decisions made by managers
that show little concern for teaching and learning needs.
This is reinforced by the by research we’ve done which
shows a lack of staff voice in the direction of many
polytechnics” says Proctor-Thomson. “It’s exciting to
see a proposal that puts staff, students, iwi, and
communities at the heart of creating a system that delivers
for students, communities and
employers.”</p><p>Proctor-Thomson says the TEU has long
advocated that academic, general and allied staff are the
best ones to design teaching, learning, administrative and
support service, and research approaches.</p><p>“Staff are the
ones who will make sure the promise of life-changing
education in our system becomes a reality. This includes
ongoing involvement of trained teaching staff in designing
curriculum, assessing quality, and of course the day-to-day
work we do in workshops, laboratories, classrooms and
more,” says Proctor Thomson.</p><p>The TEU sees the need for
industry informed teaching in vocational education and
training, and this Minister must ensure that staff who have
teaching and learning qualifications are strongly connected
into the qualifications approval framework, and through both
the Workforce Development Councils and Regional Skills
Leadership Groups.</p><p>National Industrial Officer Irena
Brorens says that in this time of great change the Minister
and Transition Board need to ensure a level of transitional
certainty. “We are pleased that there is a clearly set out
time-frame to work out the structure of the new entity and
employment relationships within it. That ensures employees
are transferred to the new entity and their collective
agreements are transferred on 1 April 2020.</p><p>TEU will push
to ensure the government follow through on its ongoing
promises to provide proper transition funding. This funding
must include providing resources to stop the ongoing cuts to
programmes and services in the current polytechnics. Brorens
says “If the government and transition board don’t act
now, there will be no courses left on which to build a
network. A new day for vocational education starts with
stabilising and then building new and exciting
opportunities.”</p><p>Longer term the aim of the reform is to
consolidate some services. TEU members do not accept this
means large scale job losses. Together we will be making
sure that the skills and knowledge of existing staff is kept
in the vocational education sector. We believe this change
should deliver more jobs in the vocational education sector
as we provide more education opportunities for communities
around New
Zealand.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
