<p>Major changes are afoot in the tertiary education sector so
the timing of the 2019 Voices of the Sector Forum could not
be better.</p>

<p>Today, 13 August, 100 leaders from the tertiary
education sector, business, iwi, and community meet at the
University of Waikato to debate what’s needed to ensure
that the sector meets society's needs and provides
sustainability of institutions.</p>

<p>NZUSA President James
Ranstead says students are keen to see a refocusing of the
tertiary education sector on teaching and
learning.</p>

<p>“Sadly many students feel that institutions
and policy-makers see them as revenue. This means decisions
being made which cut courses and services that are meant to
foster quality learning.”</p>

<p>Ranstead says the government
has taken a step forward with the decision to unify the
vocational education sector, and we hope that tomorrow’s
forum will reflect the refocussing on collaboration and a
systems-wide approach to ensuring strong quality and
accessible education.</p>

<p>NZTEU President Michael Gilchrist
notes that two forums run last year focused on the need to
review the funding mechanisms.</p>

<p>“While the Minister of
Education has set out clearly the need to review the funding
model, there is no firm plan of how this will be done or the
principles for setting out a funding system.”</p>

<p>The staff,
students, iwi, and business leaders in the room tomorrow
need to really get a firm sense of what tertiary education
is for and what funding is needed to deliver, says
Gilchrist.</p>

<p>“For TEU members, general, allied and
academic – who are in the laboratories, workshops, lecture
theatres, libraries, and workplaces with students –
education is a public good that everyone benefits
from.
</p>

<p>You only need to think about an average day to see
how important tertiary education is to us. You get clean
drinking water because of scientists and engineers who
trained in a university, polytechnic, or wananga; a nice cup
of coffee because of baristas who did in-work training; safe
cars because of mechanics who got their start as an
apprentice in the tertiary education sector or at a
polytechnic.”</p>

<p>Gilchrist says “Now is the time for us
all to agree on a funding model that delivers on that public
good.”</p><p>
