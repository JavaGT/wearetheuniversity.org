<p>The proposed
changes, too, are mostly reflective of the way the Aotearoa
student population is evolving.</p>

<p>“With a much greater
pool of Māori and Pacific students in the tertiary
education sector than previously, it is great that the
Government is taking a focus on this, likewise with disabled
students. It is however, disappointing to see that
international students are not included in the consultation
document whilst comprising 50,000 of our national student
pool, so we will be pushing hard for a change on this in our
submission” said Ranstead.</p>

<p>NZUSA partner the Tertiary
Education Union has also come out in support of todays
announcements.</p>

<p>Sharn Riggs, TEU National Secretary, noted
that student voice has been silenced and compromised since
the law changed in 2014 making membership of students’
associations voluntary. Riggs also welcomed Minister Hipkins
recognition that action must be taken and committed to
wide-ranging consultation to address these issues and ensure
a strong student voice for the future. The TEU will continue
to support the NZUSA and its members as they advocate for
their preferred approach to strengthen student voice.</p>

<p>The
consultation document will be soon uploaded on the Ministry
of Education kōrero mātauranga website. NZUSA and Te Mana
Ākonga will be mobilising student groups over the next
couple of months to ensure it is students that are driving
the discussion on this
topic.</p>
