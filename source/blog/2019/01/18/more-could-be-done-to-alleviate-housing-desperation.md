<p>‘Amidst this housing
shortage, many tenants are celebrating the recent and
proposed tenancy law changes. This includes the removal of
letting fees late last year which prevents landlords from
passing the cost of a letting fee onto a tenant, and the
proposal to limit rent increases to once per year. The Fees
free will also be assisting students through this
process’, says Ranstead</p>

<p>The Healthy Homes Act will
introduce standards for heating, insulation, ventilation,
moisture and drainage, and draught stopping, though many of
the legislative particulars are yet to be decided
upon.</p>

<p>‘With such a shortage in housing, students will
often take less than adequate housing as it is the only
option available, and so we encourage the Government to be
ambitious, and to set standards that care for our future
leaders and remove Aotearoa’s poor legacy of housing
quality compared to the likes of European countries’ says
Ranstead.</p>

<p>NZUSA believes an additional way that this can
be done is to enforce the need for a rental Warrant of
Fitness, currently a voluntary scheme in Wellington that has
also been trialled throughout the
country.</p>
