<p>President
of the Association of Students’ at the Universal College
of Learning Karla Davis is excited for this necessary
change, however stressed the importance of student support
throughout the process of change and within the final model,
saying 'students are our leaders of tomorrow'.</p>

<p>NZUSA will
be focusing heavily on student voice in their submission,
and although greater influence from industry has its
positive elements, it runs the risk of shutting out student
voice and leadership. 'We need a collaborative approach –
from the campus level, all the way through to the National
Governance framework of the New Zealand Institute of Skills
and Technology. This is our
opportunity'.</p>
