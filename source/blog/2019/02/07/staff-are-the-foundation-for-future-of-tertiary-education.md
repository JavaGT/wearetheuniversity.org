<p><br>Education Minister, Chris Hipkins will be reminded today
by the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) that the success of
his planned reform of institutes of technology and
polytechnics (ITPs) will depend on the extraordinary skill,
knowledge and experience of the people working and studying
in the sector.</p>

<p>In its report Changing Lives [1], to be
published this afternoon, the TEU emphasises that staff
conditions of work are students’ conditions of learning.
Unless the Minister puts the relationship between staff and
students at the centre of a reformed ITP sector, his reforms
are bound to fail. It was a timely reminder from the TEU,
coming just one week before the Minister announces radical
plans to restructure ITPs and change the vocational
education and training system.</p>

<p>Changing Lives makes clear
that these reforms must guarantee a significant increase in
funding for the sector, and an end to the broken competitive
system put in place under the last Government. It also say
the reforms must ensure a nationwide network of provision
that reaches into every community, ensuring all New
Zealanders have access to tertiary education through a range
of delivery options.</p>

<p>Michael Gilchrist, national president
of the TEU, said: “ITPs and vocational education more
broadly provide life-changing learning opportunities to
thousands of New Zealanders. Whether it’s a young person
figuring out their path, changing careers later in life,
learning new skills or finding their passion, ITPs are there
to support them on their way. A priority for the Minister
must be to make sure ITPs stay broadly and deeply connected
to the communities, both regional and urban, in which they
are placed.<p>

<p>“More than this, the hard-working teaching
and allied staff in ITPs play a crucial role in helping us
develop the practical and intellectual skills we need to
meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world. The
Minister must remember when he makes his announcement next
week that ITPs and their connections to local communities
and industry, provide a vital link between what this
Government has promised and what it can deliver. Without the
skill, experience and dedication of the staff in the sector,
we simply cannot train future house builders, nurses, and
social workers.”</p>

<p>Other recommendations in the TEU’s
report Changing Lives call on the Minister to:</p>

<p>Demonstrate
the reforms proposed for the ITP sector foster the Tiriti
relationship expressed in Te Tiriti o Waitangi<br>Allocate
funding on a secure and equitable basis so we can finally
pay a Living Wage to all staff directly and indirectly
employed; eliminate any and all gender pay imbalances; and
stop the proliferation of casual, insecure and fixed-term
employment agreements.<br>Preserve and enhance the regional
distinctiveness of all campuses and courses, without
exception<br>Ensure every campus, regardless of its location
or proximity to other campuses, has an academic leader
appointed who will work with staff to make decisions that
will improve teaching, learning and research<br>Guarantee
all regions will have access to tertiary level learning
opportunities, including ensuring the provision of levels 1
– 4 in every community<br>End all competitive funding and
adopt the recommendations in the TEU’s recent report
Funding the
Future</p>
