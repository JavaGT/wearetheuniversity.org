	 <p>
         8 February 2019<br> </p><p>In Aotearoa New Zealand, everyone
should have the opportunity to attend some form of tertiary
education, and to have a positive experience along the way.
Our Institutes of Technology &amp; Polytechnics (formally known
as ITP’s) teach over 170,000 of our tertiary students per
year and are tasked with providing mainly vocational
education to our regions and cities</p><p>It is forecasted that
over half of New Zealand’s 16 ITP’s are to be
financially unsustainable by 2020. Many ITP’s around the
country are in crisis mode, slashing courses and staff, and
requiring significant structural changes to continue to be
viable under the current funding system. Student voice is
also meagre compared to Universities.</p><p>‘The system as it
currently stands is not delivering for our people and
communities, and is increasingly roadblocking student
opportunity. The ITP Roadmap is the most significant
opportunity for change that the sector has seen in the past
twenty years, and it could not be more urgent’, says James
Ranstead, President of the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations (NZUSA).</p><p>NZUSA welcomes the Tertiary
Education Union’s report ‘Changing Lives’ released
yesterday, which makes clear that these reforms must
guarantee a significant increase in funding for the sector,
and an end to the broken competitive system put in place
under the last Government.</p><p>The New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations also strongly advocates for the
three following points –</p><p>That student voice is placed at
the heart of institutional functioning and is improved from
the current minimal and unequal state of affairs across the
sector.

<p>That provision within our regions and urban
centres ensures communities have local access to
courses.</p><p>That the sector fosters the Tiriti relationship
expressed in Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and caters for our
diverse communities with diverse learning needs from Māori,
Pasifika and global backgrounds.</p><p>With these
recommendations put in place, Aotearoa New Zealand can be
sure to have a sustainable ITP sector that is working
towards equity of educational opportunity, and truly
functioning as ‘society’s great leveller’.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
