<p>It’s hard to look forward to a summer break when your
employer undervalues the work you do.</p>

<p>That’s the
sentiment from members of the Tertiary Education Union and
the Public Service Association at the University of Waikato
who met today to discuss the latest pay offer from their
employer.</p>

<p>The University’s management is offering staff
an average pay rise of 1.66% over the next three years, well
below what TEU and PSA members in other universities have
collectively negotiated. This is because the pay rises
won’t happen until March next year.</p>

<p>TEU organiser and
lead advocate for both unions, Shane Vugler says those in
front of students, working in the labs and offices, entering
results and marking exams, are being told they are going to
get a lower salary increase than staff in every other NZ
University for the next three years.</p>

<p>“This pay offer
comes on the back of a systematic disinvestment in staff by
the University over the last four years, as well as
widespread restructuring and job losses across the
University in 2019. All of this at the same time as they are
funding a massive building programme on both the Hamilton
and Tauranga campuses”.</p>

<p>TEU and PSA members are angry
that they are expected to cope with increased workloads and
continue to improve their research and student outcomes,
while in return are only offered  the equivalent of 1.66%
(this equates to only a 5% increase right through until
2023).</p>

<p>TEU and PSA members at the meeting today decided to
reject the offer and move to a strike ballot in the New
Year.<p>

<p>“No one wants to accept this pitiful pay offer and
nobody relishes the prospect of having to take strike action
hanging over their summer break, but we have no option until
the University recognises and values the excellent job that
staff do for students and our communities,” says
Vugler.</p>

<p>PSA organiser Frank Jackson adds “PSA members
are as dismayed by the situation as are TEU members, and
remain keen to work together. We hope that management can
understand our determination here, and improve their
offer”.</p>
