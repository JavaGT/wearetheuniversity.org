         </p><p>As results of the fourth Performance Based Research
Fund (PBRF) Quality Evaluation round are released, the
Tertiary Education Union is repeating its call for PBRF to
be scrapped.</p><p>National President, Michael Gilchrist,
says the major review of the PBRF planned by the government
provides the opportunity to refocus New Zealand’s
universities, wānanga, and polytechnics on delivering high
quality research. ‘Unfortunately, there is currently far
too much focus on rankings in institutional league
tables.’</p><p>‘Initially the performance approach
increased the emphasis on research in tertiary institutions.
But after four gruelling rounds of individual assessments
those benefits are well past. All that remains are the
negative aspects: high compliance costs and administrative
overheads; a six yearly treadmill for staff; intrusive
processes; gaming of the system; and misuse of results,’
says Gilchrist.</p><p>Gilchrist notes that there has been
a significant distortion of normal research activity.</p><p>“The imperative to publish in a select few
international journals has caused a marked reduction in
specialised and locally based research. We urgently need
that research to meet the unique challenges our country
faces in the future and advance the wellbeing of all.”</p><p> “The flaws are so great in this way of evaluating
research quality and achievements that it’s time to start
afresh. Tinkering around the edges won’t cut it.’</p><p>Jenny Salesa is heading a review of this performance
funding approach – one that was actually put in place by
an earlier Labour government. The TEU has already begun
contributing to this review.

<p>In June the union will
release a report which outlines what academics think of the
current system. That report will also suggest better ways to
ensure we put public funds into quality research that
contributes to social, scientific, and human
advancement.</p><p>Gilchrist says “Rigorous peer review
systems, institutional incentives for performance and the
powerful curiosity and research ethos of our academics
already provide many guarantees of research quality and
productivity.</p><p>The government’s Education
Conversation provides an opportunity for us collectively to
work out more productive ways to allocate funding and
improve research in our universities, wānanga, and
polytechnics.</p><p>“We can do so much better. The PBRF
has to
go.”</p><p>ends<!-- LINKS REMOVED
