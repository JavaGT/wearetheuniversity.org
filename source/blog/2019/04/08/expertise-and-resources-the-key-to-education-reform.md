<p>Ensuring students get access to expert teachers and industry
practitioners is the focus of the <a href="https://teu.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fb04aaec9ab34fde94735fa91&amp;id=cbdfd0b9f3&amp;e=4f8b9a1aa4" target="_blank">Tertiary Education Union’s
submission</a> on the Reform of Vocational Education
made public today. But the best laid plans for the future
will not succeed unless the government steps up with
transition funding for the beleaguered polytechnic
sector.</p>

<p>Thousands of TEU members have been involved in
meetings on campuses, completed online surveys, and
participated in submission writing to inform the TEU’s
contributions to the vocational education
conversation.</p>

<p>National President Michael Gilchrist says
“What these conversations have shown is tertiary education
institutions can’t focus properly on learning outcomes
when they fear losing funding for students because those
students get jobs part way through their studies. They are
penalised for success. That’s why we’re supporting the
single funding model for those training on campuses and
in-work.”</p>

<p>“But sadly the Minister’s vision of every
New Zealander being able to move between in-work and
on-campus training will remain a dream unless the government
provides proper transition funding for any changes agreed to
by cabinet.”</p>

<p>Gilchrist says polytechnic chief executives
have continued to review courses and student services in
order to trim budgets even as the system-wide review is
conducted.<p>

<p>“In some communities we will have no
on-campus provision left on which to build a coordinated
vocational system if the chief executives don’t take a
breath and stop planned cuts, and if the government
doesn’t step up with transition funding.”</p>

<p>The TEU is
also calling for the Minister of Education to reveal how he
will review the entire tertiary education funding
model.</p>

<p>National Secretary, Sharn Riggs, says removing
competition between the existing tertiary education
providers and putting in place a platform for closer
collaboration on core functions – from curriculum design
to student management systems – will benefit students and
industry. And it can be done in a way that supports good
jobs in all the communities served by existing
polytechnics.</p>

<p>However consolidation alone is not going to
save the sector. Persistent underfunding of tertiary
education has run down our institutions and the
staff.</p>

<p>“You can’t teach at the cutting edge of
industry if you don’t have the machinery and technology to
do it. You can’t innovate when every minute of the day is
filled covering classes because there aren’t enough
tutors”, says Riggs.</p>

<p>“If we want a vocational
education system that contributes to solving climate change
and delivering builders to help turn around our housing
crisis, that creates cutting edge innovators and nurses who
care for us when we are ill, then it’s time the Minister
reviewed the entire tertiary education funding
system.”</p>

<p>Beyond the funding concerns, Michael Gilchrist
notes the government’s willingness to recognise the
expertise of the teaching, administrative, and support staff
in polytechnics is crucial to designing the future has been
a hugely positive factor in the review process.</p>

<p>“Over
the last 18 months we’ve sat alongside chief executives,
students, the Industry Training Federation, government
officials and community members discussing the vocational
education reform. It was disappointing that the professional
knowledge of trained polytechnic tutors and the importance
of their relationship with students to quality learning
outcomes has not always been recognised by others.”</p>

<p>The
TEU supports the establishment of Industry Skills Bodies and
stronger coordination of vocational education but stresses
teaching and learning experts are at the heart of
decision-making about what should be taught and how it
should be taught.</p>

<p>Gilchrist says “we need the government
to continue to recognise the teaching expertise of the dual
professionals working in polytechnics as the reforms
progress. And we need recognition that staff conditions of
work impact on the quality of the teaching and learning
experience.”</p>
