<p>Restructuring at the University of Waikato will affect more
than the 50 people whose jobs are under a cloud says the
Tertiary Education Union.</p>

<p>“This shake up in the end will
impact on the quality of the experience of students and the
engagement with the community and employers” says TEU
organiser Shane Vugler.</p>

<p>University management are
currently consulting on restructuring of administration and
support services following the establishment of five new
divisions in 2018.</p>

<p>Vugler says staff were assured that no
jobs were going in the shakeup. “Then two months into the
new teaching year we are told that 50 administration and
support staff are facing a very uncertain
futures.”</p>

<p>“The Vice Chancellor put in five highly paid
pro-vice chancellors during last year’s shake up and now
he’s turned around to save money by cutting those working
with students and staff on the frontline.”</p>

<p>TEU national
industrial officer, Irena Brorens, says “the moves to cut
support and administrative staff will cost long-term.
We’ve had a sneak preview of the latest research on
wellbeing in the tertiary education sector and it shows that
the continuous under investment in staff is now harming
student learning and well-being.”</p>

<p>Brorens says “A
survey of nearly 3,000 staff a third reported that support
services had got worse over the last three years in the
tertiary education sector. This is because our institutional
leaders, like the Vice Chancellor at Waikato, are
underinvesting in staffing.”</p>

<p>“Since Neil Quigley
arrived at Waikato four years ago the amount of money which
goes into staff costs has dropped from 59% of expenditure to
54%. If you keep cutting and cutting the staff at your
institution, eventually the effect will be felt by those
relying on excellent support and administrative services –
the students.”</p>

<p>Vugler hopes that during the next three
weeks there will be genuine consultation and they show that
they are listening to staff and students.</p>

<p>Last year, staff
and students in Maori studies successfully opposed their
department being subsumed into new divisions set up to
‘streamline’ reporting to the Vice
Chancellor.</p>
