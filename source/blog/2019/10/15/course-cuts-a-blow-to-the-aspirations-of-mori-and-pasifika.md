<p>Course cuts in South Auckland
another blow to the aspirations of Māori <br>TEU members at
MIT and nationally are condemning the cuts proposed for
tertiary education provision in South Auckland. Cuts they
say will harm Māori, Pasifika and low-income
learners.</p>

<p>MIT is proposing to cut courses in Creative
Arts, Horticulture, and Tourism, with at least 15 jobs
lost.<br>The proposed cuts affect areas with high numbers of
Māori and Pasifika students.</p>

<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi |
Tertiary Education Union Māori Vice President Hūhana
Wātene, on behalf of the union’s national Māori
committee Te Toi Ahurangi, has written to the Minister of
Education noting that:  “Once again, the most vulnerable
learners in our society are being disadvantaged by an
education system that has traditionally failed them at all
levels.”</p>

<p>Wātene says that the words of the Minister of
Education and the aspirations in the new Tertiary Education
Strategy of boosting achievement of Māori and Pasifika are
ringing a little hollow for staff in the polytechnic sector
right now, as ever deeper cuts are made to what is taught
and where.</p>

<p>“If Māori learners are really a priority of
this government, they’ve got to step in to protect Māori
and Pasifika positions and end the relentless job cuts in
the polytechnic sector.”</p>

<p>In the letter Te Toi Ahurangi
and MIT members argue that a culturally responsive tertiary
education system is reliant on having a broad range of
courses, including Māori tourism courses and creative arts
courses which helps build the cultural identity and
confidence of learners.</p>

<p>“Members of Te Toi Ahurangi and
MIT want the future of vocational education to be bright for
Māori and all learners.</p>

<p>That means ensuring there are
enough courses, for the proposed NZ Institute of Skills and
Technology to meet the needs of learners, whānau, hapū,
iwi, communities, and industries,” says
Wātene.</p>
