<p>Reform of Vocational Education Student Wishlist
2019:</p>

<p>Ensuring provision is localised in regions that need
it, regardless of the population size (bums on seats) that
currently drives provision levels.<br>Well supported RoVE
transitions that maintain and enhance educational quality
and learner experience.<br>A seamless transition from
education to employment, regardless of student background
and qualification.<br>Independent students associations as
opposed to student councils supported, with a guaranteed
level of resourcing. This is in contrast to the current
piecemeal system, leaving some institutes with no student
voice whatsoever<br>Adequate on campus student services
reflective of the pre-Voluntary Student Membership era, with
a special emphasis on mental health services<br>Youth
Guarantee Compulsory Student Services Fee (CSSF) payment
exclusion covered by parent institute<br>Organisational
structure and education that is flexible (e.g. blended
learning) to suit the 21st century student, meanwhile
avoiding online learning being used a crux<br>A National
Center for Student Voice that enhances student voice
capacity, quality and relationships.<br>Enhanced support for
diverse learners (particularly Māori and Pasifika),
including the incorporation of different worldviews into
what is currently a homogenised western structure and way of
educating<br>Free Tertiary Education, or at the very least
the continued roll-out of the coalition Government’s Fees
Free Policy<br>Fulfilling this wishlist will ensure that all
vocational education students have a positive experience,
and that all campuses will be able to experience the success
of those ITP’s that have managed to cope throughout the
system we currently have, such as the Eastern Institute of
Technology</p>

<p>“The Eastern Institute of Technology has some
of the most impressive student outcomes in the country. Half
of EIT's domestic students are Māori and have some of the
best achievement rates in New Zealand. EIT has a real
connection with the communities of Hawke's Bay and
Tairāwhiti which enable it to target the root causes of
student challenges. A strong students' association that can
effectively lobby EIT and represent students' views has been
vital in ensuring good governance and decision making.”
Said Andrew Lessels, President of the EIT Students’
Association
