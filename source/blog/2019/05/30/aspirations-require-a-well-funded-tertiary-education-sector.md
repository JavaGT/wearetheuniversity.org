         Media Release – 30 May 2019</p><p><br>Wellbeing aspirations
require a well-funded tertiary education sector</p><p>New budget
spending of $3.8 billion to improve the lives of working
people and their families - the largest new spending in over
a decade – is welcomed by the New Zealand Tertiary
Education Union. But the aspirations are reliant on a strong
tertiary education sector – a sector which has missed out
on real investment for the 11th year running.</p><p>“We
applaud investment in mental health, more teachers, housing
first, transitions for youth in state care, and major spend
on sexual and family violence programmes” says TEU
National Secretary Sharn Riggs.</p><p>“But the lack of
significant new investment in tertiary education could harm
the government's long-term aspirations. To improve
well-being you need more teachers, Pasifika nurses, social
workers, builders, addiction counselors – yet parts of our
tertiary education system are crumbling away.”</p><p>The
government has recognised the need for major changes in the
tertiary education sector with its review of vocational
education and tagging of unspent monies from the last year -
$197 million – to improve the vocational education
sector.</p><p>And the Minister of Education Chris Hipkins has
repeatedly acknowledged the overall funding crisis which has
brewed after nine years of neglect of tertiary education by
the last National government.</p><p>“Given this recognition we
are disappointed again that there is no attempt to
substantially invest in the well-being of our students,
communities, and environment by putting new money into
tertiary education. The sector is just going to keep
crumbling with funding that barely recognises the cost of
education inflation.”

<p>“The government is staying very
safely inside the current fiscal responsibility targets. It
has money in the bank for a rainy day. For many students and
staff in the tertiary education sector the rain is pouring
through the rooves of their institutions because of chronic
long-term underfunding.”</p><p>Riggs says we need the Minister
of Education to set in place a plan to address the gap
between the cost of running the sector and the funding put
in.</p><p>“Just like the teachers who took strike action
yesterday, the staff in the tertiary education sector have
no more to
give.”</p><p>ends<!-- LINKS REMOVED
