<p>‘Cheating by university students paying
‘ghostwriters’ to write essays for them is totally
unacceptable and requires a nationally co-ordinated
response’, says the New Zealand Tertiary Education
Union.</p>

<p>TEU National President Michael Gilchrist says
‘Unfortunately the news that this problem is extensive and
possibly growing is a further symptom of the continuing
commercialisation of university education in New Zealand. It
is a symptom of the reduced role this commercialisation
allows for staff engagement with students and staff voice in
assessment design and implementation.’</p>

<p>‘We need to
take this problem seriously and lift our game in this area.
That means calling on the expertise of lecturers, tutors and
student support staff across the country. They are the
experts who can identify ways to: <br>•	Improve staff
contact with students;<br>•	Support genuine student
engagement;<br>•	Make it as difficult as possiblefor
ghostwriting to go undetected; and,<br>•	Make it as
difficult as possible for anyone using a ghostwriter to
succeed in passing a course.</p>

<p>We would like to see a
nationally co-ordinated response, including national
guidelines developed in this area. We have written to
Universities New Zealand asking them to meet with us to
discuss ways of developing such a response.</p>

<p>‘We must
also look at the systemic pressures highlighted in the latest research into the state of the public
tertiary education sector with regard to ongoing attacks
on the profesional integrity of staff,’ says
Gilchrist.
</p>

<p>The discovery of the extent of this problem is
a challenge that we should not ignore – it is also an
opportunity we should not miss. It is an opportunity to
improve the quality and integrity of our university system
by adopting strategies that go beyond treating students as
customers and competing for their enrolment fees.</p>

<p>That in
turn will improve the standing of our university system,
both here and
overseas.</p><p>
