         <br>The Tertiary Education Union congratulates Professor
Dawn Freshwater on her appointment as the next
vice-chancellor of the University of Auckland.</p><p>The
chancellor of the university announced the appointment
today. Freshwater, a Professor in Mental Health, will become
the University's first female Vice-Chancellor, after serving
as the University of Western Australia's Vice-Chancellor and
Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Registrar for six
years.</p><p>University of Auckland Branch President,
Nicole Wallace, says union members look forward to the
mutual exchange of ideas about teaching, learning, and
research at the university.</p><p>“We know that the best
strategic ideas come out of collaborative and creative
processes involving all staff, and look forward to ensuring
Professor Freshwater has at her fingertips the best advice
possible from those of us on the frontline of teaching,
learning, support services, and research,” says
Wallace.</p><p>TEU organiser Enzo Giordani says the UoA
branch look forward to providing a briefing for the new vice
chancellor. The briefing will be drawn from meetings of
members.</p><p>“Members want to work at an institution
that continues to be a world class research and teaching
institution, but also one that puts the wellbeing of
students and staff at the heart of all activity.  Professor
Freshwaters research centres on mental health and we hope
this will enable a much stronger people focused strategy
than we have seen in the past.”</p><p>TEU National
President Michael Gilchrist notes that Professor Freshwater
has a strong background in strategic planning and
change.

<p>The chancellor has stated that Freshwater is
a “passionate advocate for values-led and inclusive
leadership”, something that is sorely needed at the
University of Auckland, says Gilchrist. “We urge Professor
Freshwater to ensure that as a first step she recognises the
painful changes that have occurred over the past few years
at the University”</p><p>“The voices of staff have not
been heard in those changes. Indeed in many cases the  views
of staff have been actively suppressed by references to
duties of fidelity and confidentiality – references we see
as entirely inappropriate for a public institution of such
importance to our community as the University of Auckland .
We hope that Professor Freshwater will fully embrace genuine
student and staff input into the future shape of the
university.<br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
