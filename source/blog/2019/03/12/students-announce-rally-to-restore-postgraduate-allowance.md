	 <p>
         The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
have today announced plans to rally on Parliament and
present their postgraduate student allowance petition.</p><p>The
Postgraduate student allowance is a weekly stipend that
assists Postgraduate students (those studying above a
bachelor’s degree at either Universities or Polytechnics)
to help cover living expenses whilst studying. 
</p><p>Postgraduate allowances were scrapped by the previous
Government in 2013. Labour, along with the Greens and New
Zealand First, pledged to restore the postgraduate allowance
during the 2017 General Election.</p><p>“Restoring the
postgraduate allowance isn't just good for students, it's
good for the country. Across Aotearoa, postgraduate students
are studying in fields that are crucial to our country's
future – climate change, freshwater, poverty and mental
health. The current government is committed to solving these
issues, however in order for this work to succeed, we
urgently need to be supporting and empowering our people to
gain skills in these areas. A postgraduate student allowance
is an easy step towards making this a reality” says NZUSA
President James Ranstead.</p><p>NZUSA began a petition on the
Postgraduate Student Allowance in early 2018, and have since
collected thousands of signatures. They will present the
petition on parliament lawn to Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick,
and will later speak at select committee.</p><p>Student
representatives from around the nation have been contacting
NZUSA in the lead up to this event and sharing their
thoughts.

<p>The Otago University Postgraduate association
said that “Postgraduate students are burdened with heavy
workloads yet receive little financial support. Having to
work twenty or more hours a week in a part-time job to make
ends meet takes a strain on important research, research
that ultimately provides benefit to society as a
whole”.</p><p>Alongside the improvement of support for
researchers in crucial fields and a government showing
accountability, the restoration of the postgraduate student
allowance will also make our higher education more
fair.</p><p>‘Fairness is important to all of us. We need a
fair and equitable student support system across all course
types, from certificate level right through to a PhD.
Education should be upheld as a way of reducing inequality,
however the lack of a Postgraduate student allowance stifles
student opportunity’ says Ranstead.</p><p>Individual students
have also been reaching out on this topic - </p><p>‘I’m
passionate about reducing New Zealand’s horrific suicide
rate through studying towards a career in psychology.
Unfortunately due to the lack of financial support at
postgraduate level I’ve had to put that dream on hold’,
says Nicole (Bachelor of Social Science in Psychology,
University of Waikato).</p><p>Students will walk on Parliament
on April 11th, between 12.30 – 2pm, on Thursday 11th
April.</p><p>More detail can be found on the Facebook event page
