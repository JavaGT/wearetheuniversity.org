<p>The Otago University Postgraduate association
said that “Postgraduate students are burdened with heavy
workloads yet receive little financial support. Having to
work twenty or more hours a week in a part-time job to make
ends meet takes a strain on important research, research
that ultimately provides benefit to society as a
whole”.</p>

<p>Alongside the improvement of support for
researchers in crucial fields and a government showing
accountability, the restoration of the postgraduate student
allowance will also make our higher education more
fair.</p>

<p>‘Fairness is important to all of us. We need a
fair and equitable student support system across all course
types, from certificate level right through to a PhD.
Education should be upheld as a way of reducing inequality,
however the lack of a Postgraduate student allowance stifles
student opportunity’ says Ranstead.</p>

<p>Individual students
have also been reaching out on this topic -<p>

<p>‘I’m
passionate about reducing New Zealand’s horrific suicide
rate through studying towards a career in psychology.
Unfortunately due to the lack of financial support at
postgraduate level I’ve had to put that dream on hold’,
says Nicole (Bachelor of Social Science in Psychology,
University of Waikato).</p>

<p>Students will walk on Parliament
on April 11th, between 12.30 – 2pm, on Thursday 11th
April.</p>
