         TEU Press release, University of Auckland, 25 November
2019</p><p>Members of Te Hautū Kahurangi at the University of
Auckland just want a little respect and trust from their
employer, and they’re willing to stand up together to
achieve it.</p><p>Tertiary Education Union members met last week
to decide where to go in their stalled collective
negotiations.</p><p>Two matters are creating frustration.</p><p>The
employer’s proposal of a complex, obscure, and unfair pay
system for the people who look after the paperwork, the
libraries, the safety of staff and students, the finances,
and much more. </p><p>And the ongoing misinterpretation of
academic freedom by their employer.</p><p>TEU co-branch
president, Nicole Wallace, told the meeting that
professional staff have really endured a lot during these
past years. </p><p>“Ultimately, we’ve put up with it because
we care about our jobs, and so we’ve put in the unpaid
overtime to make sure that students’ thesis results are in
in time for the next graduation or gone that extra mile so
everyone in our team can meet the examination
deadline.”</p><p>Wallace says the feeling from staff is that
in return for this effort, we’ve been treated as if ours
jobs aren’t really so important, that we aren’t really
important.</p><p>“We’re not asking for the earth in these
negotiations, just a fair, transparent, and objective pay
system - something all workers deserve and many in our
sector get.”</p><p>As well as being treated fairly, the
members at the paid stopwork meeting want some respect back
and that means being able to use their legislated academic
freedom.

<p>Co-president Jennifer Frost told the meeting that
the small progress initially made on the issue of academic
freedom had been wound back.</p><p> “Our collective agreement
should reflect the right of staff and students to comment on
all matters related to teaching and learning, including
reviews and restructures. We want to keep working on this
matter constructively with our employer as we strongly
believe broader consultation and discussion are necessary to
good decision-making.”</p><p>Some at the meeting felt that
staff had less voice on campus, and less right to speak up,
than controversial student groups.</p><p>The meeting agreed it
was time to stand up collectively to send their employer a
clear message – staff deserve better. </p><p>They’ll begin
the actions in the first week of December and have vowed to
keep going until they see a shift in the attitude of their
employer.<br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
