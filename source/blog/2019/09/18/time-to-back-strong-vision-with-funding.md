<p><br>17 September 2019</p>

<p>Tertiary education staff and
students engaged energetically in the government’s
education conversation and their hopes and dreams are
imprinted in the Draft Tertiary Education Strategy released
today.</p>

<p>That’s the message of the Tertiary Education
Union | Te Hautū Kahurangi.</p>

<p>“The vision set out in the
draft strategy is a vast improvement on the previous
strategy,’ says TEU National President, Michael Gilchrist.
“The first objective – to put learners and their
communities at the centre of the education system, from
early childhood through to tertiary education – is exactly
the shift we need from a narrow focus on serving the needs
of the economy and the labour market.”</p>

<p>Gilchrist states
that staff in the sector have for a decade wanted to see the
humanity returned to education and have wanted to be part of
a quality tertiary education system that is accessible to
all.</p>

<p>“We have been heartbroken by funding cuts that
resulted in government and institutional management seeing
student support services and supporting staff as
nice-to-haves. For example, we know of members who wanted
help for a suicidal student who couldn’t find the support
needed for that student because the counselor and nurse
hours on campus had been cut down or stripped away
entirely.”</p>

<p>The draft Tertiary Education Strategy gives
us hope that this government sees education as being about
whole people with needs for both academic and pastoral
support.<p>

<p>“That hope will fade fast unless, as  a matter
of urgency, the government moves to transform our funding
model to reflect the laudable priorities in the draft
Tertiary Education Strategy. Research into the State of the Sector
shows that the goodwill of staff, their ability to do more
and more with less, has almost run out.”<p>

<p>Gilchrist says
there needs to be additional investment in the tertiary
education system and changing the way that investment is
directed. If the government is serious about this vision of 
quality public education that is genuinely accessible to all
New Zealanders then they must loosen the purse strings –
and they must seek broader outcomes with their funding - if
the benefits of this draft strategy are to be
realised.</p>

<p>TEU also welcomes the emphasis in the draft
strategy on:</p>

<p>•	putting learners and learning as the
centre of the system;</p>

<p>•	lifelong education and ongoing
learning while working;</p>

<p>•	the emphasis on te reo and
tikanga Māori;<p>

<p>•	including the arts and humanities in
the tertairy education strategy as a necessity not
nice-to-haves;</p>

<p>•	developing clear and supported pathways
through the system that recognise diverse talents and
enhance student choices;</p>

<p>•	 investing in tertiary staff
and recognising teaching skills and
training;</p>

<p>•	enhancing the ability of research to focus
on well-being in New Zealand; and,<p>

<p>•	an holistic view
of the education system from early childhood through to
tertiary level<p>
