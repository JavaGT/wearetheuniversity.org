advantage of university education</p><p>The Association of
University Staff [AUS] says that data on participation in
tertiary education released by the Minister yesterday
reflects a continued trend of little growth in students
enrolling in university education – with most growth
occurring in the shorter and cheaper education
courses.</p><p>AUS notes that the 1.4 per cent growth in overall
university participation is skewed by significant growth in
one, the Auckland University of Technology, which still
offers a range of shorter, vocational courses. If only the
other seven universities are considered, there is a
significant drop in participation.</p><p>Dr Bill Rosenberg, AUS
National President, said that, “The data supports the latest
OECD report which notes that New Zealand tertiary education
participation rates are above average in attainment of
certificates, diplomas and vocational courses, but below
average attainment in university level education – and
considerably behind countries such as Australia, the United
Kingdom and Canada in that respect.”*</p><p>“Relative to other
OECD countries, New Zealand is also currently producing a
below average number of PhD graduates, “ said Dr Rosenberg. 
“If Government is serious about investing in research and
development and developing New Zealand as a highly-skilled
knowledge society, it must recognise that university
education is expensive. Students, particularly those from
currently under-represented groups, must be adequately
supported if they are to commit to university degree and
post-graduate study.”
</p>
<p>“If slow growth in university
enrolments continues, Government under-funding will clearly
be exposed. It was previously masked by faster growth rates,
but a continued participation decline will result in more
universities in financial difficulties.”</p><p>AUS welcomes the
increase in student participation in public institutions and
reduced participation in Government subsidised courses in
private training establishments. It hopes that this signals
a re-alignment in the sector and results in increased
Government investment in essential public
infrastructure.</p><p>Contact:<br>Bill Rosenberg 021 680 475, 03
