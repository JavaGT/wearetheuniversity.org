STAFF TO STRIKE<br>Members of the combined unions at the
University of Canterbury have voted to take a 24 hour strike
during Enrolment Week (17 – 21 February).</p>

<p>University of
Canterbury AUS Branch President Jane Guise said today that
“The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of strike action.
Union members have sent a clear message to University
Management that they will not accept the lowest pay offer to
University staff in the country.”</p>

<p>The decision on which
day to strike will be made at a stop-work meeting to be held
on 17th February – the first day of Enrolment.</p>

<p>“University management have now offered to meet again, and
we welcome the opportunity to resolve this crisis.  However
members have articulated their bottom line, and we believe
the management must take this on board in their response”,
Jane Guise said.</p>

<p>Jane Guise said that the ball is firmly
in the employer’s court.  “They can take the sensible
approach to meet our reasonable demands and avert the
strike, or they can force members into taking the action
that has been planned.  The responsibility for disrupting
Enrolment Week rests entirely with them.”</p>

<p>The unions have
organised a rally for Monday 3rd February 2003 to voice
their frustration, coinciding with the campus visits of the
prospective Vice Chancellor candidates. “We want to show
them that the successful candidate must see rebuilding the
damaged staff relationships as a priority,” Jane Guise
concluded.</p>

<p>Release ends</p>

<p>Note:  The rally will commence
at 9am on Monday 3rd February.<br>It will be held between
the Registry and library buildings.<p>
