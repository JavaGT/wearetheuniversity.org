delay on GATS<br>The Association of University Staff (AUS)
today called for the Government to delay the deadline for
submissions on the General Agreement on Trades in Services
(GATS) from 28 February to 30 June to allow for a better
assessment of requests made of and by New Zealand in the
current round, and for full public disclosure and
consultation.</p><p>Speaking to a national workshop of
university staff, AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg,
said that the continued inclusion of tertiary education in
GATS would require government funding and tuition subsidies
to be made available to foreign providers, and would
restrict government from regulating the sector.</p><p>“This is
completely contrary to the current governments philosophy
which rejects the “market” model and calls for a planned and
cooperative approach to the provision of tertiary
education”, said Dr Rosenberg.</p><p>Dr Rosenberg reiterated
calls for New Zealand to withdraw its existing commitment to
education as part of GATS, saying that the commitment opens
the provision of education in private institutions in New
Zealand to foreign competition</p><p>Dr Rosenberg said that
while the Government has asserted it will defend public
education, its position has been severely compromised by the
double standards it has displayed in the extraordinarily
wide requests it has made to other WTO countries to open all
sectors of their education to competition.
</p>
<p>“Given the
international groundswell to end the coverage of education
and other public services by GATS, the time is ripe for the
New Zealand Government to take the initiative to ensure that
they are specifically excluded”, Dr Rosenberg
said.</p><p>Ends<br>For further information or comment please
