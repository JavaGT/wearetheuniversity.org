Heightened by GATS Demands<br>Long-held concerns about the
effect of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)
on public tertiary education were heightened by the release
of information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Trade (MFAT) on Friday.</p>

<p>Dr Bill Rosenberg, National
President of the Association of University Staff [AUS] said
that least one country, thought to be the USA, has asked New
Zealand to open up its entire tertiary and adult education
sectors to foreign competition as part of the GATS
agreement.<p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said that, if accepted, this
would include access to subsidies and limits on the ability
of our government in its wish to regulate the sector. “It
would accelerate commercialisation and widen leakage of
scarce public funds to private and international companies,”
he said.</p>

<p>New Zealand, for its part, has asked other
countries to open up their entire education sectors to
foreign competition.<p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg today accused the New
Zealand Government of putting the university sector, and
public tertiary education generally, into an extraordinarily
exposed position.</p>

<p>“Although it has proposed guiding
principles for the liberalisation offers it intends to make
in New Zealand, it appears to disregard those principles in
the requests it has made of other countries. It is
effectively saying to other countries: we expect you to do
what we won’t do at home”.<p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg says that AUS is
most disturbed that the government has given away any moral
high ground in protecting public education by its requests
of other countries.<p>

<p>AUS shares the concern of the New
Zealand Council of Trade Unions [NZCTU] at the extensive
requests made of New Zealand, and joins calls for a
substantial extension of time beyond the 28 February
deadline for comments to MFAT, and the 31 March deadline for
New Zealand’s initial GATS offer to the WTO, to allow proper
public debate. AUS will be joining other unions and
organisations in a day of action against public services
being included in the GATS, on 13 March.</p>
