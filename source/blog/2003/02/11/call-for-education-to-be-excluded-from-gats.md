calls for education to be excluded from GATS</p><p>The
Association of University Staff [AUS] today welcomed a
government assurance on the GATS negotiations and public
education, but called on the government to have public
education and other public services explicitly excluded from
GATS.</p><p>Responding to a statement by Associate Education
Minister, Steve Maharey, that "the government has no
intention of opening up New Zealand's public tertiary
education system to a greater degree of foreign
competition",  AUS pointed out that the government's
assurance (as published on MFAT's web site) is only for the
government's initial GATS offer, due on 31 March. It does
not preclude offers being made in the course of the
negotiations, neither does it acknowledge the dangers to
public education in the GATS commitments made in 1994,
including one to open primary, secondary and tertiary
education to international competition.</p><p>"We retain deep
concerns that intense pressure from the U.S. and other
countries will lead to those principles being compromised,"
said Dr Bill Rosenberg, National President of AUS. "This is
reinforced by the New Zealand government's request to other
WTO members to open their entire education systems, public
education included, to commercial competition."</p><p>"This is a
staggering inconsistency with the government's stated
principles," Dr Rosenberg. "How seriously will other
countries take our principles when we are making demands
like this of them?"
</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg said government must
ensure that public education and other public services are
explicitly excluded from GATS and pointed out that the
European Commission announced in the last few days that it
will not be making any requests of other countries in a
number of public service areas, including education. </p><p>"If
it is serious in defending its stated principles, our
government should be taking a lead in the WTO on this
important matter," he said.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further information
