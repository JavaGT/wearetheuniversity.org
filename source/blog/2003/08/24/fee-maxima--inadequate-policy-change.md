POLICY CHANGE SAY UNIVERSITY STAFF</p><p>Changes to fees and
course costs maxima announced today by the Government have
drawn a mixed reaction from the Association of University
Staff [AUS].</p><p>The changes, which limit the extent to which
tuition fees can be raised to 5%, have been described by AUS
National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, as a major, but
inadequate, change in the Government policy.</p><p>While
welcoming any move to restrain increasing students’ costs,
Dr Rosenberg pointed out that this, once again, reinforced
the need for the Government to address the long-standing
funding problems that universities face.</p><p>‘Now that the
Government has decided to limit the ability of universities
to set fees, it will need to significantly increase its
investment in the sector.  The funding increase for 2004
does not address the significant losses in funding suffered
by universities during the 1990s and is insufficient to meet
their operational needs. This will be underlined when salary
bargaining gets underway in the next few weeks,’ said Dr
Rosenberg. </p><p>‘This is a major issue and will have a
pronounced impact on the ability of universities to ensure
their degree programmes meet international standards.’</p><p>Dr
Rosenberg also expressed disappointment at the exclusion of
postgraduate student fees from the fee maxima policy,
despite strong representations from sector
groups.</p><p>Contact:<br>Bill Rosenberg	, National President,
