         Media Release 21 August 2003 <br>For Immediate Use</p><p>AUSA
Welcomes The Fees Maxima As A Step In The Right
Direction</p><p>The Auckland University Students Association
today applauded the new fees maxima that will see Auckland
University fees capped for the next three  years.</p><p>AUSA
policy has always been free education but they welcome the
maxima as a  step in the right direction.</p><p>Education Vice
President Kate Sutton said, "I am pleased with the 
governments decision to make access to education a priority
rather than the  Universities profit making approach." She
went on to say " Auckland  Students do very well out of the
maxima as we pay the highest fees in the county."</p><p>Auckland
University has signaled that it will approach the TEC for 
exemptions to the maxmia and AUSA is committed to fighting
against this so that education is accessible to
all.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>For further Information Contact:</p><p>Kate Sutton
