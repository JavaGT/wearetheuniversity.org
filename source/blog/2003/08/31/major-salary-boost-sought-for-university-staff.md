         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0">Major salary boost sought
for university staff<br>University unions are to claim a
salary increase of 10% per annum over the next three years
for academic staff, in negotiations which are expected to
get underway with university employers in September. A
similar claim, to increase general (non-academic) staff
salaries by 10% in 2004, followed by inflation adjusted
increases for the following two years, will also be made.
The claim for general staff will be supplemented by a
proposal to increase job evaluation alignments to the higher
quartiles of the salary market and for the investigation of
a national university-based job evaluation scheme.</p><p>The
claims have been endorsed by union members at a number of
meetings over the last week in the seven universities to be
covered by proposed new national collective employment
agreements for academic and general staff. </p><p>The salary
claim is based around gaining parity with the major
Australian universities and addressing recruitment and
retention problems forecasted to beset universities
internationally by the end of the decade. It has been
estimated that more than 230,000 new academic staff will be
needed by 2010 in the 5 countries (including New Zealand)
from which New Zealand universities recruit most of their
academic staff. </p><p>Spokesperson for the unions, Association
of University Staff (AUS) National President, Dr Bill
Rosenberg, says analysis shows that New Zealand salaries lag
significantly behind those in Australia. “On a straight
conversion basis, New Zealand salaries are as much as 22%
behind those in Australia, and even when using OECD
Comparative Price Level data, it is apparent that purchasing
power value is up to 13% behind. Higher superannuation and
leave benefits give the Australians a further margin of at
least 11% on their New Zealand counterparts,” he said.

<p>Dr
Rosenberg said that the Australian tertiary education unions
have filed a 24% salary claim for the next three years, and
the first settlements have provided salary increases there
of between 15% and 18% over the three year period.</p><p>Dr
Rosenberg said pushing general staff salaries into the
higher quartiles of the salary market could result in
sizeable increases for those staff, and said the importance
of investigating a national job evaluation scheme, based
around university values, has the potential to bring a
consistent and equitable approach to salary setting for
general staff across the whole university sector.</p><p>A claim
will also be made to develop mechanisms at each university
to assess and control workloads, and to establish a
high-level committee of union and staff representatives at
each university with the intention of both increasing staff
involvement in strategic decision-making and in the
democratic management of faculties, schools and departments.
