<p><br>University negotiations resume</p>

<p>University unions and
employers will meet in Christchurch on Wednesday and
Thursday this week to resume the negotiation of national
collective employment agreements in the university sector.<p>

<p>The university unions have claimed a salary increase of
10% per annum over the next three years for academic staff
and 10% in 2004 for general (non-academic) staff plus
increases in job evaluation alignments to the higher
quartiles of the salary market.<p>

<p>The unions are seeking
national collective employment agreements for academic and
general staff, as part of an effort to ensure the long term
sustainability of high-quality university education in New
Zealand.</p>
