<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0">The pay hike for members of
parliament, announced last week, confirms the need for
salaries in the university sector to lift substantially
according to the National President of the Association of
University Staff, Dr Bill Rosenberg.</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said
that prior to 1988, backbench members of parliament and
university senior lecturers had the same salaries, both set
by Higher Salaries Commission. The latest increase now gives
those MPs a margin of $36,671, or 50%, over the senior
lecturers.</p>

<p>“This further confirms that New Zealand
university salaries are languishing behind both
international and relevant domestic comparators,” said Dr.
Rosenberg. “It also seems extraordinary that government
ministers have accepted their increased salaries without
question, yet refuse to adequately address unsatisfactory
levels of university funding. This is particularly galling
as they know that salary increases in the university sector
are reliant on increased funding”.<p>

<p>Just last Friday, the
Tertiary Education Minister, Steve Maharey, stated that
“Tertiary education is key” to achieving his government’s
vision for New Zealand as a ‘knowledge society’. ‘The
“knowledge society” is far more than a quick cliché – it’s
an imperative’, he said. “How can University staff be
expected to achieve this ‘imperative’ when funding has
fallen by one third since 1991?” asked Dr
Rosenberg.<p>
<p>University staff have claimed an increase to
salaries of 10% per annum over the next three years for
academic staff, and 10% in 2004 for general staff plus
increases in job evaluation alignments to the higher
quartiles of the salary market.</p>

<p>The unions will be seeking
new national collective employment agreements with
provisions to increase staff involvement in strategic
decision making within universities and measures to ensure
protection against increasing workloads.</p>

<p>Negotiations
resume in Wellington this week on Thursday 6 and Friday 7
November.</p>

<p>Ends</p>
