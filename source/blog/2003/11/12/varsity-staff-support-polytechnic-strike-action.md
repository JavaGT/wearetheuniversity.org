         <br>Varsity staff support polytechnic strike action</p><p>
</p><p>University staff said they support their counterparts on
strike at polytechnics around the country today.</p><p>
</p><p>Teaching staff at six New Zealand polytechnics are on
strike over the failure of their employers to agree to a new
multi-employer collective employment agreement, and their
failure to offer adequate salary increases to staff during
negotiations.</p><p> </p><p>Association of University Staff (AUS)
National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg said that polytechnic
employers, like their university counterparts, were failing
to grasp the significance of the new environment which
clearly called for cooperation and collaboration across the
whole tertiary sector.</p><p> </p><p>“Tertiary sector employers are
carrying on in the competitive model of the 1990s,” said Dr
Rosenberg. “The government supports multi-employer
bargaining and it is extraordinary that polytechnic
employers are wasting new opportunities, time and public
money by carrying on in a highly competitive mode”.</p><p> </p><p>Dr
Rosenberg said he believed the inadequate levels of funding
in the tertiary sector were major factors that were
exacerbated by the lack of cooperation between employers and
called on the government to address long term systemic
funding problems.</p><p> </p><p>“Government tuition funding to
universities and polytechnics is still more than $1500 per
student behind 1991 levels and current funding projections
give little hope that this will increase to allow for well
deserved pay increases,” he said.</p><p> </p><p>Dr Rosenberg said he
was disappointed that the government had not addressed
funding difficulties for tertiary institutions in recent
Budget rounds and seemed content for industrial
confrontations to arise as a result.</p><p>
