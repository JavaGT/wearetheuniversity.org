huge financial waste on litigation<br>The President of the
Otago University branch of the Association of University
Staff (AUS), Mark Peters, today criticised University of
Otago management for its huge financial waste on litigation
associated with collective employment agreement
negotiations.</p><p>Mr Peters was commenting on the Employment
Court’s dismissal of a case taken against AUS by Otago
University in which the university sought to have what it
described as "secret strikes" declared illegal. The
University also alleged that, during last year’s bitter
industrial dispute, AUS had breached good faith requirements
by failing to advise specifically when strike action would
occur during a series of rolling stoppages. </p><p>"University
management have spent ten's of thousands of dollars in
litigation against AUS in the past 18 months, trying to
prevent union members from exercising their lawful right to
strike. In every single case the Court has completely
rejected the University’s position. </p><p>The legal costs,
staff time and negative publicity generated by these weak
cases have not been in the interest of  staff, students or
the wider university community ", said Mr Peters.</p><p>"The AUS
calls upon university management to come clean and tell the
public how much of their money has been wasted on these
futile exercises. They should be publicly accountable,” he
said.
</p>
<p>Mr Peters said union members hoped that AUS moves to
negotiate national collective agreements later this year
will bring an end to the litigious approach taken by Otago
University. "Bargaining is about negotiation, not
litigation," he said</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further comment please
