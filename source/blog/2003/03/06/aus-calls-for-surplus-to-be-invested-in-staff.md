surplus to be invested in staff<br>The announcement of
$13.04 million operational surplus for Otago University has
drawn a call from the Association of University Staff (AUS)
for increased investment in staff.</p><p>AUS Otago Branch
President, Mark Peters, said today that the surplus, along
with a 10% increase in student enrolments, leaves the way
abundantly clear for further investment in staff. He said
that the 4% salary increase paid to staff in the last year
did not appear to have had an adverse effect on the
University’s financial performance but had been insufficient
to address poor salary levels.</p><p>Mr Peters maintained that
staff salaries are still well behind acceptable domestic and
international comparators. “Otago needs to address its
recruitment and retention problems now rather than later”,
he said. “Further investment in buildings and infrastructure
will be useless without core staff to teach and
research”</p><p>Those staff teaching medicine and dentistry,
courses which Mr Peters described as the jewels in Otago’s
crown, continue to have base salary rates which are in the
vicinity of $25,000 less than those doing similar work for
District Health Boards. </p><p>Mr Peters said that while the AUS
is pleased with the reported surplus, it raised questions
over the University’s claims that it could not afford the
salary increases needed to restore international salary
relativities. “This surplus clearly shows that Otago
University can afford to invest considerably more in its
staff,” he said.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further comment please
