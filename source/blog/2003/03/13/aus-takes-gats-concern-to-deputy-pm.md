Concern to Deputy PM<br>A delegation of union leaders
including the National President of the Association of
University Staff (AUS), Dr Bill Rosenberg, will meet Deputy
Prime Minister, Michael Cullen, this morning to voice
concerns about New Zealand’s commitments under the General
Agreement in Trade in Services (GATS). The meeting coincides
with world wide action against GATS.<p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said
the objective of the meeting will be to ensure that
education and health, and other public services are excluded
from GATS.</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said New Zealand’s five education
unions and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions are in a
growing company which opposes education being included in
GATS. This includes South African and all European Regional
Ministers for Culture and Education. Similar opposition has
been declared by four associations representing over 5,000
degree-granting universities and colleges in Europe and
North America, and by Education International, the world’s
main international education trade union body, representing
24.5 million teachers and education personnel.</p>

<p>Dr
Rosenberg said that Dr Cullen’s assurances that public
education would not be subject to GATS were compromised by
New Zealand’s request to other countries to open all sectors
of their education to competition. “Already our existing
commitments are causing concern and should be revoked”, he
said.</p>
