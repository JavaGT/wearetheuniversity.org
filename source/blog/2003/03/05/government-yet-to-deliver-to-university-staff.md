<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Government claims to
have increased funding to public tertiary institutions by
9.8% in the past three years paints a misleading picture
says the Association of University Staff (AUS).<p>

<p>Responding to statements made to students during
orientation week by the Associate Minister of Education
(Tertiary Education), Hon, Steve Maharey, that the
Government has “delivered for students”, AUS National
President, Dr Bill Rosenberg says it is time the Government
“delivered” to staff.</p>

<p>“The increases in funding to which
Mr Maharey refers were offset by the cost of a student fees
freeze. The universities have been no better, and in some
cases worse, off,” said Dr Rosenberg. “Government funding
per student remains significantly less in dollar terms than
a decade ago and the burden of that underfunding has fallen
on staff through redundancies and salary erosion.</p>

<p>"While
university staff welcome an end to rising student fees, the
government must urgently address the funding problems in
universities", said Dr Rosenberg.<p>

<p>"Given the legacy of a
decade of diminishing funding per student the fee freeze has
exacerbated the problems of internationally inadequate
salaries and constantly squeezed funding for research and
new initiatives."</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said that it was high time
that the government, universities and unions sat down
together to work out a reasonable framework for funding the
institutions. It is particularly urgent and appropriate
given that budget decisions are now being made and the
government is entering into triennial funding for the
tertiary sector.</p>
