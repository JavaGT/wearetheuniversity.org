         Association of University Staff - Media Release</p><p>Attn
Education Reporter<br>Thursday, 4 December 2003</p><p>University union welcomes call for increased
investment</p><p>The Association of University Staff (AUS today
welcomed the statement from the Associate Minister of
Education (Tertiary) Steve Maharey that more investment is
needed in the university system. </p><p>Delegates to the AUS
annual conference, being held in Wellington this week, were
told by Mr. Maharey today that additional funding, over and
above that already proposed for targeted initiatives, was
needed within in the sector but said it would more likely
come initially from a redistribution of existing
resources.</p><p>Conference delegates said that while the
Minister needed to ensure that additional funding was
allocated for universities in next year's Budget, the $19
million that had not been spent in the private tertiary
sector this year could be immediately reallocated to
universities. "This would show some genuine desire to
resolve funding difficulties," said AUS National President
Dr. Bill Rosenberg.</p><p>Mr. Maharey told the AUS conference
that a number of new initiatives would focus on building
capacity and assisting the sector "to transition to the new
tertiary environment". He outlined details of a planned
Review of the Tertiary Education Workforce which will be
conducted over 2004 and the first half of 2005; a Review of
Quality designed to enhance the quality of teaching and
learning; and the proposed teaching performance element of
the funding framework.

<p>Mr. Maharey said he intended to
work with stakeholders, including staff and students, to
identify needs that the tertiary education system, aligned
with the Tertiary Education Strategy, will be required to
meet in the future. He gave several examples, such as the
Canterbury Tertiary Alliance, where efficiencies within the
system could "flourish and contribute to an improved sector
performance".</p><p>In response to questions, Mr. Maharey said
that the establishment and compliance costs would also
reduce with the on-going implementation of the
Performance-based Research Fund. </p><p>Ends</p><p> </p><p>
