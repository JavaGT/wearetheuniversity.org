<p>Association of University Staff - Media Release</p>

<p>Attn
Education Reporter Wednesday, 3 December 2003</p>

<p>Unspent
private tertiary funding should be redistributed in the
public sector</p>

<p>More than $19 million in unspent funding in
the private tertiary education sector should be reinvested
in the public tertiary education says the Association of
University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>Associate Education (Tertiary)
Minister, Steve Maharey has announced that the $19 million
in unused funding from 2003 will be reallocated through a
Strategic Priorities Fund to new or growing PTEs in 2004. Mr
Maharey said that the money was not used this year because
some PTEs under spent their allocations and others 'exited'
the system. He intends to keep the money in the private
sector.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, says
the government should take the opportunity created by the
failure of PTEs such as Carich and Modern Age to to review
whether private institutions should receive public funding
at all, and to immediately reduce the overall funding handed
over to private institutions. "To say these institutions
'exited' the system is an insult to all those students who
lost money and to staff who lost their jobs. It shows the
Minister is not a fast learner in regard to this sector,"
said Dr. Rosenberg.<p>

<p>"Funding to private institutions
rose rapidly in the dying days of the National government in
the late 1990's and the present government has done nothing
but cap this funding," said Dr. Rosenberg. "The recent
crashes have raised, once again, questions about why private
providers should profit from public funding, particularly
where facilities provided by public institutions are
duplicated in the private sector. Students, staff, public
education and the public are suffering as a result of this
badly conceived and deteriorating policy".</p>

<p>"Public
institutions are much more accountable for the quality of
their courses but are systematically underfunded," said Dr
Rosenberg. "The $19 million would have been better used to
double the amount of new money the government put into the
performance based research fund this
year".</p>
