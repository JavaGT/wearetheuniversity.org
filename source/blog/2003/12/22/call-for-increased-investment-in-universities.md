         Association of University Staff - Media
Release</p><p><br>Friday, 19 December 2003</p><p>Call for increased
investment in universities</p><p>Despite its strong economy, New
Zealand continues to invest less in university education
than most other developed countries according to the
Association of University Staff (AUS). Responding to the
announcement yesterday by Minister of Finance, Dr Michael
Cullen, that New Zealand's improving economy had freed up $1
billion more for spending in next year's Budget, AUS
National President Dr Bill Rosenberg called on the
Government to increase substantially its investment in
universities.</p><p>Dr Rosenberg said increased spending in
university education was consistent with the Budget strategy
to advance the Government's policy programme in education
and to build a strong public sector generally. It was not
just consistent with the Government's intention to develop a
knowledge-based society but essential to its success.</p><p>Dr
Rosenberg said that government funding of universities fell
between 1980 and 2002, in real terms, by 35% or just under
$4,000 per student. Current plans to increase funding by
slightly more (1.2% in 2004) than the inflation rate for the
next three years was insufficient to position New Zealand's
universities competitively with other developed
countries.</p><p>"By 2006 the actual government funding for most
degrees will still be around $1500 less in actual terms than
in 1991," said Dr. Rosenberg.</p><p>Dr. Rosenberg says staff
workloads have risen considerably over the same period. The
number of equivalent full time students per staff member has
risen from 12.3 in 1980 to 18.3 in 2002, an annual increase
of 1.7%. "As a result," he said, "New Zealand universities
are at a crisis point with long-term threats to quality if
action is not taken".</p><p>"The increased Budget surplus is an
ideal opportunity for the Government to re-examine its
spending plans and priorities, and to show that its rhetoric
about the importance of universities and their staff to the
future of New Zealand's economic and social well-being is
matched by increased investment.</p><p> Ends </p><p>
