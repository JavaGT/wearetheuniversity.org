<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"> Green light for national
salary bargaining in universities<br>University staff have
voted overwhelmingly to support the negotiation of national
collective employment agreements in the 2003 bargaining
round. The ballot, conducted on a university-by-university
basis, endorsed a recommendation by the Association of
University Staff (AUS) to move from enterprise based
bargaining at each university campus to the negotiation of
one national collective agreement for academic staff and one
national collective agreement for general staff.<p>

<p>1216
(86.8%) of the 1402 academic staff who participated in the
ballot voted in support of the proposal, and 1165 (85.5%) of
the 1362 general staff who participated also voted to
support national bargaining.<p>

<p>It means that bargaining
with the universities will be initiated by mid-August and it
is anticipated that negotiations will commence shortly after
then.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, said he
was delighted at the result. “The high number of those
voting and the high level of support for the proposal give
AUS a very clear mandate to enter national bargaining with
university employers, and we look forward to engaging in
constructive dialogue with them.<p>

<p>“It also shows that
university staff appreciate the very clear link between
funding and salary levels, and support the view that the
government has a responsibility to significantly increase
funding into the sector.”</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said he expected
university employers to respect the strong wish of staff to
bargain on a national basis.</p>
