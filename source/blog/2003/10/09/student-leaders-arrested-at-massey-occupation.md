<p>Student leaders arrested at Massey occupation</p>

<p>Up to ten
students have been arrested after the student occupation of
the Massey University Registry protesting fee
rises.</p>

<p>Arrested students include New Zealand University
Students’ Association Co-President, Fleur Fitzsimons, and
Massey University Students’ Association President Andrea
Grant.</p>

<p>“We question the police and the university’s
handling of this protest,” said Roz Connelly, Co-President
of NZUSA. “We understand from eyewitness accounts that there
was very limited negotiation of the situation before arrests
were made. We will be following up today’s actions with the
appropriate bodies.”</p>

<p>“The fee increases at Massey and
elsewhere have been unecessary and unjustified. We support
students standing up for their rights to not be milked as
cash cows to fund bigger and bigger surpluses for tertiary
institutions.”
