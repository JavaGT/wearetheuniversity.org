<p>Massey Staff Support Student Demands<p>

<p>The Massey
University Branch of the Association of University Staff
(AUS) is supporting student calls for government to increase
funding to the university sector, and to improve the ratio
of staff to students.</p>

<p>Students occupied Massey
University’s registry building today, but were later removed
with up to 10 being arrested.</p>

<p>Massey AUS Branch President,
Harvey Jones, said that staff and students were all affected
by government’s under-funding of universities, staff through
low salaries and students through high tuition fees.  “We
believe the University should reinvest its recent sixteen
million dollar surplus on improving staff remuneration and
workloads, and reducing tuition fees,” said Mr Jones. “While
the university has claimed the fee rises will improve the
quality of education any increased revenue has been
allocated for spending on new buildings”.</p>

<p>Mr Jones said
that government and university management were both
promoting policies aimed at dividing staff and students.
“Instead,” he said, “the needs of both groups should be met
by government through increased funding to the university
sector”.</p>

<p>While university staff have recently claimed a
10% increase in salaries for next year, Mr Jones said this
should not come at the expense of students.</p>

<p>Mr Jones also
criticised the University’s management of today’s student
occupation. “The heavy handed removal of the student
occupiers without negotiation is reminiscent of the way in
which Massey University has treated staff in the past. We
hope this is not a signal of the way in which the university
will treat any future disagreements with its staff and
students,” said Mr
Jones.<br><p>
