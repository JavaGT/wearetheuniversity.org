	 <p>
         <br> University negotiations begin</p><p>  University unions and
employers will meet in Wellington on Monday and Tuesday (6 &amp;
7 October) this week to commence collective bargaining for
the university sector.</p><p>  The unions are seeking new
national collective employment agreements for academic and
general (non-academic) staff, as part of an effort to ensure
the long term sustainability of high-quality university
education in New Zealand. The new agreements will replace 13
current collective agreements negotiated separately at each
of the universities.</p><p>  Central to negotiation is a claim
for a salary increase of 10% per annum over the next three
years for academic staff and 10% in 2004 for general staff
plus increases in job evaluation alignments to the higher
quartiles of the salary market.</p><p>  The unions will also be
seeking to increase staff involvement in strategic decision
making within universities and measures to ensure protection
against increasing workloads.</p><p>  Association of University
Staff National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, said that staff
have been caught in a pincer between eroding levels of
funding and constraints on fees which has led to low
salaries, increased workloads and administration, and a
deteriorating infrastructure. "During the last decade most
universities have been constantly restructured resulting,
almost without exception, in the loss of frontline staff.
Morale is at an all-time low," he said  </p><p>Dr Rosenberg said
that vice-chancellors and university councils had lacked the
courage or the collective will, particularly through the
1990s, to seriously challenge government on funding. He said
that unless the universities and unions break through
funding barriers, bargaining would continue to have limited
outcomes and would not deliver the increases needed to
restore salary levels to acceptable levels nor would they be
sufficient to maintain the quality and reputation of our
academic programmes. </p><p>  Dr Rosenberg said this was no
longer acceptable to staff and that national bargaining
would provide a means by which all parties, including
government, could work together to address the issues of
funding, salaries and quality.
