         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0">The Massey University Branch
of the Association of University Staff (AUS) is supporting
student calls for government to increase funding to the
university sector, and to improve the ratio of staff to
students.</p><p>Students occupied Massey University’s registry
building today, but were later removed with up to 10 being
arrested.</p><p>Massey AUS Branch President, Harvey Jones, said
that staff and students were all affected by government’s
under-funding of universities, staff through low salaries
and students through high tuition fees.  “We believe the
University should reinvest its recent sixteen million dollar
surplus on improving staff remuneration and workloads, and
reducing tuition fees,” said Mr Jones. “While the university
has claimed the fee rises will improve the quality of
education any increased revenue has been allocated for
spending on new buildings”.</p><p>Mr Jones said that government
and university management were both promoting policies aimed
at dividing staff and students. “Instead,” he said, “the
needs of both groups should be met by government through
increased funding to the university sector”.</p><p>While
university staff have recently claimed a 10% increase in
salaries for next year, Mr Jones said this should not come
at the expense of students.</p><p>Mr Jones also criticised the
University’s management of today’s student occupation. “The
heavy handed removal of the student occupiers without
negotiation is reminiscent of the way in which Massey
University has treated staff in the past. We hope this is
not a signal of the way in which the university will treat
any future disagreements with its staff and students,” said
Mr
Jones.<br>
