<p>Bargaining protocol agreed</p>

<p>An agreement on a bargaining
protocol has been reached between university unions and
employers after mediation in Christchurch this week. A
number of dates have also been confirmed for
bargaining.</p>

<p>The bargaining protocol, which governs
arrangements and conduct between the parties during the
bargaining process, was finalised yesterday after earlier
discussions had reached an impasse over representation and
the use of information provided during bargaining.</p>

<p>Some
employer representatives had attempted to limit the
participation of staff representatives by restricting the
numbers of staff to be released on pay for negotiations and
by placing limits of which of the staff representatives
would have access to confidential information during
bargaining. Disagreement remained about the confidentiality
and use of commercially sensitive information.</p>

<p>Following
mediation, the universities have agreed to release staff
representatives on pay for the negotiations, but will review
progress after 15 days, and have withdrawn the limitation on
those staff representatives to whom commercially sensitive
information would be made available. The unions have agreed
to provisions which are intended to establish parameters by
which any analysis of confidential information provided by
employers during negotiation can be subsequently reported to
union members.<p>

<p>The unions' advocate, AUS Industrial
Officer Jeff Rowe, said that although it had required four
days and mediation to achieve a protocol, it would provide a
good basis on which the negotiations would proceed.  The
negotiations will commence on 6 and 7 November in Wellington
with a further six days scheduled before the end if the
year. They are 26 and 27 November (in Christchurch), 3 and 4
December (in Wellington) and 15 and 16 December (in
Hamilton).
