university employers and unions have been delayed after the
parties failed to agree on aspects of a bargaining protocol
intended to govern conduct during formal employment
agreement negotiations.</p><p>The negotiations, which were
expected to begin in Wellington on Monday and Tuesday this
week, have been delayed after university employers declined
to commence bargaining without further progress on a
bargaining protocol. </p><p>The areas of disagreement include
attempts by some employer representatives to: <br>•	limit
the participation of staff representatives in the
negotiations by restricting the numbers of staff to be
released and the number of days they will be released for
negotiations; and<br>•	placing limits on which of the
unions’ negotiating team members will have access to
information required for bargaining.</p><p>Union advocate, Jeff
Rowe, said it was pleasing that a number of issues had been
agreed but that an impasse had been reached on the remaining
issues. He said he was disappointed at the delay but was
confident that outstanding issues would be dealt with
through mediation.</p><p>Mediation will take place in
Christchurch on Monday 13 October with formal negotiations
expected to follow on Tuesday 14 October.</p><p>The unions are
seeking new national collective employment agreements for
academic and general (non-academic) staff, as part of an
effort to ensure the long term sustainability of
high-quality university education in New Zealand. The new
agreements will replace 13 current collective agreements
negotiated separately at each of the universities.
</p>
<p>Central
to negotiation is a claim for a salary increase of 10% per
annum over the next three years for academic staff and 10%
in 2004 for general staff plus increases in job evaluation
alignments to the higher quartiles of the salary
market.</p><p>The unions will also be seeking to increase staff
involvement in strategic decision making within universities
and measures to ensure protection against increasing
workloads.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further information or comment
