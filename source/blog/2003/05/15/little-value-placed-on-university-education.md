announced in today’s Budget, shows that the Government
continues to place little value on university education. New
Zealand universities will remain funded at significantly
lower levels than their overseas
counterparts.<br>Universities will have their funding
increased at a rate of 3% in 2004 and at the rate of
inflation for the following two years.  Student tuition fees
will be capped by the introduction of new maximum fee levels
which will control the level to which tuition fees can be
increased by individual universities.<br>Association of
University Staff (AUS) National President, Dr Bill
Rosenberg, said that while welcoming the security provided
by triennial funding, the funding levels are well below
those needed to even begin to restore the funding decline of
the last decade, or to improve salaries and cover additional
institutional compliance costs resulting from current
changes in the sector.<br>Dr Rosenberg said that while AUS
supports the regulation of student fees, he said the
introduction of a fee maximum without adequate increases in
funding would inevitably lead to increased tuition fees.
<br> “We are particularly disappointed that postgraduate
tuition fees are excluded from fee maxima requirements when,
compared to other countries, the New Zealand workforce has a
low proportion of people with postgraduate
qualifications’.<br>Dr Rosenberg said that while welcoming
increases in other areas of the education sector, it is
clear that universities are treated as the poor relation.
“<br>Dr Rosenberg welcomed the announcement that $150,000 to
be used in the first phase of a review of the tertiary
education workforce.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further information or
