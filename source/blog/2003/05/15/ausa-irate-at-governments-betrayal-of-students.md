<p><br>AUSA irate at Government’s betrayal of students</p>

<p>The
Auckland University Students Association today expressed its
surprise and disgust at the scale of fee increases heralded
by the introduction of fees maxima in today’s budget.<p>

<p>Having reviewed the fees that students will be charged in
each of the University’s departments next year, and
contrasting them to previous figures, AUSA Education Vice
President Kate Sutton admitted that this year’s budget “may
well rival some of the excesses of National Party in its
heyday.” Budget announcements point to increases in nearly
all of the courses at the University of Auckland, with some
of the University’s most popular courses expected to rise by
more than a quarter.</p>

<p>“It is so rich that at the same time
as Government and Business are desperately encouraging
students to embrace technology subjects such Science and
Engineering, the Government turns around and hammers
students in these areas with massive cost increases” Ms
Sutton continued angrily.</p>

<p>While students at the University
of Auckland will be hard hit by this initiative, Ms Sutton
also expressed concern and outrage for the impact this is
likely to have on students in the nations other tertiary
providers, whose fees have mostly been traditionally lower
than in Auckland, and who will be hit even harder.
