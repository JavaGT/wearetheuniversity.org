postgraduate fee rise<br>The Association of University Staff
(AUS) has expressed concern that postgraduate students may
be excluded from new tertiary fee maxima regulations, due to
be announced in the Budget. It means that tuition fees for
students studying at advanced levels will be exempt from
regulation, and institutions will be free to set fees at
whatever level they determine.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr
Bill Rosenberg, said today that the latest OECD data
indicates that New Zealand’s graduation rate for advanced
research programmes, PhD or equivalent, is low by comparison
to other OECD nations.<p>

<p>A 2001 Ministry of Education
report cited cost as a factor in the low recruitment of
postgraduate students after figures showed that
undergraduate numbers were increasing while postgraduate
enrolments were static. It said that fees for postgraduate
courses tended to be high in international comparisons.
“This brings into question the argument that competition
will keep these fees down,” said Dr Rosenberg.</p>

<p>Dr
Rosenberg said that allowing any increase in postgraduate
fees would threaten prospective growth. “Given the economic
and social importance of these students to New Zealand’s
research base, incentives are needed to encourage more
students to complete postgraduate work. Increasing costs for
postgraduate students is unacceptable and not in the
national interest,” he said. Dr Rosenberg also pointed to
the need to ensure our academic workforce is replenished,
noting that a PhD is generally required as the base
qualification for university academic positions.<p>
<p>Calling
on the Government to include postgraduate students in the
fees maxima regulations, Dr Rosenberg said that it is not a
matter which should be left to individual institutions to
decide.</p>
