University Staff (AUS) cautiously welcomed the call, made in
an independent review of tertiary education governance, for
a new framework to achieve good governance practice in
universities.</p><p>AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg,
said that while he supported many of the recommendations of
the review it did, however, open the way for a requirement
that student and staff representatives blindly support
Council decisions once they are made. </p><p>“While we agree
that all Council members should be seeking the best
institutional outcome, there will be genuine differences of
view on important issues, and debate on those issues should
not necessarily stop once a decision is made,” Dr Rosenberg
said. “Such gagging strikes at the very heart of academic
freedom.”</p><p>The review was undertaken by Professor Meredith
Edwards, Director of the Australian National Institute of
Governance assisted by a reference group of tertiary
education stakeholders.</p><p>A key parameter of the review was
to guarantee continued stakeholder representation which
means ensuring that students and staff remain on Councils.
Dr Rosenberg said while it was comforting to note that
student and staff representation would remain, it would be a
loss if they did not bring to the Councils the views of the
groups who elected them, particularly when the Minister has
stakeholder representation. Dr Rosenberg was also
disappointed that problems concerning the appointment of
Council of Trade Unions representatives had not been
adequately addressed in the review
</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg said he
supported the general thrust of the review, particularly the
recommendations for a National Protocol for governance,
individual Tertiary Education Institution (TEI) Codes of
Conduct, national conferences of TEIs and an Association of
Chancellor and Chairs. “It is heartening to see a review
stating that governance works best when there is a trust
amongst those who need to work together to achieve common
strategic objectives for an institution,” he
said.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further information or comment please
