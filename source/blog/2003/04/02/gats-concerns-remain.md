<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"> GATS concerns remain for
tertiary education<br>The Association of University Staff
(AUS) today expressed concern that the New Zealand
Government has failed to withdraw education entirely from
the General Agreement of Trades in Services (GATS).</p>

<p>Dr
Rosenberg said that while AUS welcomed assurances that no
further commitments will be made on education in the GATS
rounds it was disappointing that New Zealand did not take
the high ground by joining with other countries to withdraw
education entirely from GATS. “A first step would have been
to withdraw the reckless education commitment made in 1994.
Yet the government has not made any moves to withdraw this
or other commitments that conflict with its own policies”,
he said.</p>

<p>There were a number of sectors related to
tertiary education which we submitted should be excluded
from the offer. We are pleased that those submissions have
been reflected in the initial offer. But we remain concerned
at what may happen during the negotiations.</p>

<p>“Despite
public assurances that the Treaty of Waitangi would be
protected, the government is still relying on the current
inadequate commitment which provides protection only to
commercial and industrial activities of Maori,” he
said.</p>

<p>“The Government’s move to clarify the protection of
public services from the GATS is non-binding”, said Dr
Rosenberg. “It does not reclaim the right to regulate
important services which are not in public ownership. The
clarification should be widened and entered into New
Zealand's schedule of commitments. Otherwise it has no legal
standing before a WTO Disputes Tribunal.”<p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg
said that assurances the initial GATS offer was likely to be
a minimal one have not proved to be correct. “There are
significant commitments offered. This does not bode well for
the final outcome after the enormous pressures of these
negotiations have been brought to bear”, he said.</p>

<p>“We
continue to be disappointed that the government has rushed
through this offer and call on it to release any requests
and offer documents in a timely manner as negotiations
continue.”<br>Ends<br>For further information or comment
