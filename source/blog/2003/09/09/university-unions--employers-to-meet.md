<p>University unions &amp; employers to meet</p>

<p>University unions
and employers will meet in Wellington on Wednesday this week
for discussions prior to the formal commencement of national
collective agreement bargaining in the university sector
later in the month.</p>

<p>It follows the announcement last week
that university unions are to claim a salary increase of 10%
per annum over the next three years for academic staff and
10% in 2004 for general (non-academic) staff plus increases
in job evaluation alignments to the higher quartiles of the
salary market.</p>

<p>The union and employer parties are
expecting to arrange dates for bargaining and to formalise
bargaining protocols at the meeting.<p>

<p>AUS Industrial
Officer Jeff Rowe has been named as the lead advocate for
the unions. He will be assisted by Jenny Chapman from the
Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) and Mark
Ryan (PSA), and a team of 12 staff from the seven
universities cited as parties to the negotiations.</p>

<p>The
unions are seeking national collective employment agreements
for academic and general staff, as part of an effort to
ensure the long term sustainability of high-quality
university education in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Association of
University Staff National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, said
that cuts in real funding to universities over the last 12
years had not only eroded the pay and working conditions of
staff, but were also increasingly affecting the quality of
education for students.<p>



<p>Dr Rosenberg said that staff
are the crucial factor in determining the quality of
university education scholarship and research. “Higher
workloads, reduced opportunity for research and a decaying
university infrastructure have combined to provide a serious
threat to the credibility and reputation of New Zealand
universities. We are determined that this must be
rectified,” he said
