universities</p><p>The Minister of Labour, Hon Margaret Wilson,
has told university women that there is evidence the gender
pay gap exists as much in universities as other sectors of
the workforce.</p><p>Opening the Association of University Staff
(AUS) Biennial Women’s Conference yesterday, Ms Wilson, said
that while academic staff at universities and other tertiary
institutions have high levels of education and experience,
there was evidence that the gender gap is greater for well
paid women than for low income earners. With respect to
general (non-academic) staff in universities, Ms Wilson
cited the University of Auckland EEO report which found that
while women were well represented numerically in the
workforce, they were not well represented in senior
positions.</p><p>The conference was told that the Government’s
taskforce on pay and employment equity is examining the
social, employment, economic, and other factors contributing
to pay and employment inequity and to advise Government on a
5 year plan to address those inequities. Research shows that
women’s hourly earnings lag 15.7% behind men overall, but
21% behind for high earners. </p><p>Margaret Wilson said that
the wide focus of the Taskforce on pay and employment equity
required it to take into account the Government’s other
policies to support employment equity for women. This
included that appointment of a dedicated EEO Commissioner 
and the Government’s commitment to a comprehensive work/life
balance programme over the coming year.<br>Margaret Wilson,
a former AUS member, said more direct support for pay equity
would also come out of the review of the Employment
Relations Act. She said updating the existing equal pay
legislation would make it more accessible and user-friendly
and reinforce the fundamental right to equal pay for men and
women doing the same job.
