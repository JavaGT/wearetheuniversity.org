         <br>AUSA disappointed but vows to carry on</p><p>AUSA president
Scott Kelly said "Obviously I am disappointed with the 
result" of the Compulsory/ Non compulsory student membership
referendum  announced today. </p><p>"This is not just
disappointing for me but should be  disappointing to all
students whose representation is been gradually eroded  as a
result of non compulsory membership"</p><p>He went on to say
"The recent decision by the University to increase fees 
significantly, and in some cases past the fees maxima, shows
the need for a  strong, representative student
voice."</p><p>AUSA president-elect Kate Sutton said "Voluntary
membership brings with it  distinct challenges but AUSA as a
body will continue to champion the rights  of students as it
has since its formation in 1891"
