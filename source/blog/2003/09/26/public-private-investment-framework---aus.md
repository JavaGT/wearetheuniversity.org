<p>Public Private Investment Framework - AUS</p>

<p>Concern at
public-private sector tertiary education investment
framework Concern has been expressed at the development of a
new public-private sector tertiary education investment
framework announced this week by government.</p>

<p>The
Partnerships for Excellence facility enables tertiary
institutions to seek matching funding from government for
large-scale investment projects (generally those valued at
$10 million or more).  It has been established to encourage
greater private sector investment in tertiary education and
to foster better linkages between tertiary institutions,
business and industry.</p>

<p>Association of University Staff
(AUS) National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, while welcoming
additional funding, says concerns expressed last year about
the increasing dependency of universities on the private
sector funding are heightened by the announcement.<p>

<p>"We
would have expected academic issues to be safeguarded in the
conditions and criteria as part of the framework. Instead
the safeguards focus largely on financial risks," he said. 
"This scheme highlights the increased reliance of public
institutions on private funding. Steadily increasing
dependency of the universities on private funding will
inevitably lead to challenges to their independence. In
particular pressures will increase on staff not to comment
unfavourably on commercial interests".<p>

<p>Some of the
proposals could include "joint governance" or joint venture
arrangements with private industry. "We are concerned that
such arrangements could be de-facto partial privatisation of
important research facilities," said Dr Rosenberg.
"Relationships between the institution and private partners
in permanent arrangements like these raise concerns
regarding academic freedom".<p>
