sector tertiary education investment framework</p>

<p>Concern has
been expressed at the development of a new public-private
sector tertiary education investment framework announced
this week by government.</p>

<p>The Partnerships for Excellence
facility enables tertiary institutions to seek matching
funding from government for large-scale investment projects
(generally those valued at $10 million or more).  It has
been established to encourage greater private sector
investment in tertiary education and to foster better
linkages between tertiary institutions, business and
industry.</p>

<p>Association of University Staff (AUS) National
President, Dr Bill Rosenberg, while welcoming additional
funding, says concerns expressed last year about the
increasing dependency of universities on the private sector
funding are heightened by the announcement.<p>

<p>"We would
have expected academic issues to be safeguarded in the
conditions and criteria as part of the framework. Instead
the safeguards focus largely on financial risks," he said. 
"This scheme highlights the increased reliance of public
institutions on private funding. Steadily increasing
dependency of the universities on private funding will
inevitably lead to challenges to their independence. In
particular pressures will increase on staff not to comment
unfavourably on commercial interests".<p>
<p>Some of the
proposals could include “joint governance” or joint venture
arrangements with private industry. “We are concerned that
such arrangements could be de-facto partial privatisation of
important research facilities,” said Dr Rosenberg.
“Relationships between the institution and private partners
in permanent arrangements like these raise concerns
regarding academic freedom”.<p>
