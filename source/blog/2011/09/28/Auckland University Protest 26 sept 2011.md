students I just want to say a few words
about our comrade Marcus he's in here
right and I want you to understand two
things a couple of weeks ago Professor
Margaret M warned that people who come
to this country from certain countries
where they've had a racist education who
behave in a racist manner disrespectful
to our history here in
Alo when there was the protest last week
for the Palestinian students the South
African security guards ID checked two
marry students one of whom was Marcus
and then trespassed him off his own
campus
sh I want to tell you two things two
things about that Campus number one it
is built on Nati fat a land and mared
people have a right to be on their own
[Applause]
land number two that University is
financed by the taxes of the working
class and middle class people of Oakland
and workers and middle class people have
a right to be on that
campus and I hereby sir the pr pass
order on behalf of the student movement
and the workers movement on every
[ __ ] racist South African security
guard up there in that
[Applause]
campus Marcus is a student in un Tech he
was with you last week in solidarity
with your occupation that's what we need
to see more of in this country
solidarity between the people who are in
struggle Street students are getting it
in the neck with high fees but students
are also getting it in the neck from
high prices High rents job insecurity
