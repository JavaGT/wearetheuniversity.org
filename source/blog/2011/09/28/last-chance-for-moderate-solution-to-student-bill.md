         </p><p> Media Release</p><p>Tertiary Education Union</p><p>28 September
2011</p><p>Last chance for moderate solution to student
bill</p><p>Today is likely to be the third and last reading of
the Act Party's voluntary student membership bill and thus
it is also Parliament's last chance to come up with a more
moderate proposal.</p><p>"If Act does not like compulsory
students’ associations that is fine," said TEU national
president Sandra Grey. "And it is welcome to have that
political battle with the associations themselves. However,
this bill goes way beyond that. It threatens to undermine
crucial student support and pastoral care, increase staff
workloads, put financial pressure on tertiary institutions
and undermine the culture and vibrancy of many
campuses."</p><p>"Staff, like most other people at tertiary
institutions, don't want this legislation," said Dr Grey.
"They know if students' associations can no longer organise
and fund their own support networks, advocacy and sporting
and cultural events, then those things either will not
happen, or staff will be asked to do them instead on already
restricted budgets. The result will be lower quality student
services, staff with higher workloads and universities and
polytechnics with less money to spend on their core jobs of
education and research."</p><p>ends
