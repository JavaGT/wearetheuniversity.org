         26 September 2011 </p><p><strong>Students fighting back at
Auckland</strong></p><p>Students and staff have attended a
rally at Auckland University today which has developed into
an occupation on the top floor of the Owen G Glenn
Building.</p><p>Around 500 students attended the rally at
1pm in the students’ association quad. About 300 then
moved to the university Registry building before taking
control of the upper floors of the business school, where
they remain at 4.30pm.</p><p>Student President Joe McCrory
spoke at the rally earlier today. “What we are seeing is a
student led movement against Government attacks on students
– Heather Roy’s voluntary student membership bill,
scheduled for third reading this week, and Steven Joyce’s
crackdown on student services levies that will see students
worse off,” McCrory said.</p><p>Student fee increases
were also a target for the demonstrators. “Government
underfunding to Auckland University has seen fees rise while
access to universities is declining.  Students are the most
vulnerable in the funding environment, and should be
protected from a lifetime of repayments. Underfunding should
not be an excuse to increase over $11 billion dollars of
student debt,” McCrory said.  </p><p>AUSA supports the
protesters objectives of rejecting voluntary student
membership, rejecting increased Government control over
student services levies, and student fee hikes.</p><p>“This isn’t the student executive leading protests,
this is regular students who have had enough of Government
regulations hurting the futures of their fellow students and
interfering with the institutional autonomy of New Zealand
universities,” McCrory said.</p><p>“The right of
universities to academic freedom is enshrined in section 161
of the Education Act, and these protests are about students
deciding what will work best on our individual campuses,
especially with regard to voluntary membership,” McCrory
concluded.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
