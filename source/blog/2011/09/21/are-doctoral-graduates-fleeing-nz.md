         <br>Media Release</p><p>21 September 2011</p><p>Are doctoral
graduates fleeing NZ?</p><p><br>A study released by the Ministry
of Education shows that graduates with doctoral degrees are
less likely to work in New Zealand than if they had only
graduated with a bachelors or masters degree. More than a
third of doctoral graduates were not employed in New Zealand
four years after they had finished their study. A fifth of
all doctoral graduates had never worked in New Zealand at
all during the four year period.</p><p>The study, 'Do people
with doctoral degrees get jobs in New Zealand post study? <http: www.educationcounts.govt.nz="" publications="" tertiary_education="" do-people-with-doctoral-degrees-get-jobs-in-nz-post-study="">
' by the Ministry of Education notes the domestic employment
rate of the New Zealand doctoral cohort was lower than in
similar leaving cohorts in Canada and the United
Kingdom.</http:></p><p>TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey says that
many doctoral students are looking for beginning positions
as academics in tertiary institutions, but New Zealand's
universities, wananga and polytechnics are not doing enough
to provide the secure, stable job opportunities and academic
working conditions these graduates need to keep them here in
New Zealand.</p><p>“New Zealand’s tertiary institutions have
an ageing academic workforce because they are not doing
enough to hire new academics. Many academics are nearing
retirement age and we could soon have a severe workforce
shortage because we have not done enough to bring new, young
academics into our institutions,” said Dr
Grey.<br>ends
