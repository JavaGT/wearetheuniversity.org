<p><strong>University of Auckland's
$640,000 vice chancellor </strong></p>

<p>University of
Auckland's boss Stuart McCutcheon received an increase in
his remuneration of between $40,000-$60,000, according to
data released by the State Services Commission. The
vice-chancellor now has a remuneration package of between
$640,000 and $649,999.<p>

<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey
says Professor McCutcheon was the third highest paid public
sector employee in New Zealand.</p>

<p>"The 6-10 percent increase
in his remuneration package is more than the salary for an
entire staff member."<p>

<p>"Many academic staff have gone
without a pay rise all year because they will not agree to
the university removing important academic conditions from
their collective agreement."</p>

<p>"We don't begrudge anyone
being paid well for doing a tough job," said Dr Grey, "but
the university needs to question whether it has got its
priorities right when it further rewards its highest paid
staff member while undermining important academic conditions
for other
staff."</p>
