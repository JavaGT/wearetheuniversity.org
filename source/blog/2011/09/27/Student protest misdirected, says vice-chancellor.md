Auckland University Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon says protestors who occupied the top level of the Business School building and stopped traffic in central Auckland are directing their anger at the wrong people.

The protest was against the Voluntary Student Membership Bill on Monday. About 200 students took part.

They want to stop the bill, which is due to pass its third reading in Parliament on Wednesday. More disruption is promised.

But Mr McCutcheon says the protest was misdirected because the university is not responsible for the legislation.

He says it was very disruptive and meant the university had to move students who were sitting an exam.
