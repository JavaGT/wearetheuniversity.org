<p><b>Tertiary education welcomes back Mr
Joyce</b></p>

<p>“We hope Steven Joyce’s reappointment as
tertiary education minister will see a new focus on
supporting people who would not otherwise be studying”,
said TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>“Mr. Joyce
talked regularly, during his first term as minister of
tertiary education, of the need for greater pastoral care of
students and for helping people into study who would not
otherwise have that opportunity.”</p>

<p>“In this second term
of Mr. Joyce’s ministership we would like to see the
policy that supports those ambitions.”</p>

<p>“Tertiary
education should not settle into a role of providing further
education to those who are already succeeding. We want to
help New Zealanders who need opportunities to contribute to
our economy and our communities. But that means policies
that focus on improving access to education and giving wrap
around support for those who want to learn but do not know
where to begin.”</p>

<p>“As professionals who work and study
in tertiary education every day, we have got a suite of
simple ideas to help students and potential students learn.
We’re looking forward to the chance to meet with Mr. Joyce
so we can work together on protecting and enhancing New
Zealand’s world class tertiary education system”, said
Dr
Grey.</p>
