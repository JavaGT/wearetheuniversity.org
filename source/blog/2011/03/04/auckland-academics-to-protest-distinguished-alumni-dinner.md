<p>Auckland academics to protest distinguished alumni
dinner</p>

<p>University of Auckland academics will be handing
out leaflets and holding placards outside their university's
Distinguished Alumni dinner tonight in protest at the
university's failure to negotiate with its staff. Their
protest is part of escalating industrial action by the
academics to get their vice chancellor to listen to them.</p>

<p>
Time: 5.45pm (the dinner starts at 6.15pm)<br> Venue: Alumni
Marquee, Old Government House Lawn<br> Corner Waterloo
Quadrant and Princes Street</p>

<p>The vice chancellor is trying
to offer academics a 4 percent pay rise - but it comes with
some big, and costly, forfeits. So academic members of the
Tertiary Education Union (TEU) have rejected the offer and
said they would rather have no pay rise at all than lose
important conditions of work that enable them to do their
job.</p>

<p>The vice chancellor is demanding academics move a
number of core conditions that are crucial to academics
doing their job out of their collective agreement and into
policy over which they would have no control.</p>

<p>TEU national
president Dr Sandra Grey says she is astonished that
Auckland University’s vice chancellor is not listening
when his own staff are saying they will turn down money so
that they can do their job the best way they can, and give
their students the best education they can.</p>

<p>"The core
conditions being defended by academic staff are not
privileges or perks – they relate directly to ensuring
quality education and research at the
university."
