         <b>Widespread Budget Cuts Don't Spare Education</b> <b></b>
</p><p>The government's plan to cut everything except health and
education is foolhardy says TEU national president Dr Sandra
Grey.</p><p>The Prime Minister said yesterday that there would
be about $800 million of new spending for education and
health in this year's budget.</p><p>"Last year there was about
$320 million of new expenditure for education and $780
million for health (2009 actual compared to 2010 budget) and
the result in tertiary education is massive numbers of
redundancies, students missing out on places and increased
class sizes," said Dr Grey.</p><p>"Last year's new funding
simply did not match the number of students who wanted to
study, or the impact of inflation. Worse, it is harder to
teach students well when budget cuts tear down the rest of
their community. When we cut housing, development, social
security and welfare spending the result for educators is
students with more stress, worse health and poorer living
standards."</p><p>"The government faces two challenges this
budget - it needs to rebuild Christchurch after the
earthquake and it needs to rebuild the economy after the
financial crisis. Both have to happen at the same time
otherwise both will fail. And both require creating jobs,
investing in opportunities and strengthening our communities
with strong public services," said Dr
Grey.</p><p>ENDS<br>
