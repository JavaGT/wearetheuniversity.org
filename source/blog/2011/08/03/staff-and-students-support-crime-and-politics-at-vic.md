         Media Release</p><p><br>Tertiary Education Union</p><p><br>3 August
2011</p><p><br>**Staff and students rally to support crime and
politics at Vic**</p><p><br>Staff and students at Victoria
University will be holding a rally tomorrow, at Thursday 4
August at 1.15pm in the Hunter Courtyard, Kelburn Parade, to
protest plans to close down the university’s Crime and
Justice Research Centre, and to disestablish two lecturer
positions in the Political Science and International
Relations programme. The university also plans to cut jobs
in the Faculty of Education, creating unacceptable gaps in
teaching and research.</p><p><br>"There is no financial case for
closing down the crime centre. Worse, the university seems
quite unaware of the immense contribution this centre has
made, and should continue to make, to government legislation
and policy in New Zealand. This is just academic vandalism,"
TEU organiser Michael Gilchrist said.</p><p><br>"The changes in
political science will sack two very promising younger
academics and limit academic choices for
students."</p><p><br>Management has not let the university's
Academic Board debate the current plans for academic
re-structuring. TEU believes, according to law and the
university's own rules, this must happen before such
significant academic changes can proceed.</p><p><br>Factsheets
providing background on current proposals are readily
available at
