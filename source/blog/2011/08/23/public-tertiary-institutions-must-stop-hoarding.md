         </p><p>Tertiary Education Union</p><p><br>22 August
2011</p><p><br>**Public tertiary institutions must stop
hoarding**</p><p><br>Tertiary institutions are hoarding cash
rather than investing in their staff and students, says TEU
national president Sandra Grey.</p><p><br>A Tertiary Education
Commission report released today <http: teu.ac.nz="" lists="" lt.php?id="YEUOCAYADVUHRAwAGAELBVo%3D"></http:></p><p>
on financial performance of tertiary education institutions
shows that publicly funded universities, w nanga and
polytechnics are all generating surpluses significantly
greater than the 3 percent of revenue that the commission
told them to generate. Polytechnics had surpluses of 8.3
percent of revenue, universities 4 percent and w nanga 7.3
percent. In total, these public institutions hoarded nearly
a hundred million dollars of public money that they could
otherwise have invested in quality education.</p><p><br>"Because
they failed to spend this money students now have larger
class sizes, highly respected staff lost their jobs and
departments have shrunk or shut," said Dr
Grey.</p><p><br>"Institutions were trusted with that money, to
spend it on students' education. Hiding it in bank accounts
while they make unnecessary cuts to the quality of education
is irresponsible."</p><p><br>"Hoarding it also gives the
government a false justification for its relentless on-going
budget cuts to tertiary education
funding."</p><p>ends
