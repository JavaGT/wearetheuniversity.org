<p>Boycott of Auckland University Courses
and Careers Day</p>

<p>Academic staff at the University of
Auckland will boycott this Saturday's highly visible Courses
and Careers Day <http: teu.ac.nz="" lists="" lt.php?id="YEUOCAcID10HRAQJVEQKCVYB"><br>
if their long running employment dispute with the university
is not resolved.</http:></p>

<p>Courses and Careers Day is a popular
opportunity for prospective students to get their first look
at the university and meet the academics who will guide
their learning next year. It is a showpiece for the
university according to TEU national president Dr Sandra
Grey.</p>

<p>"Academics would normally give up their weekend to
meet these new students and showcase the university to the
community."</p>

<p>But, after nearly a year of asking their
employer to leave their employment conditions alone and let
them get on with their job, academics are now considering
taking the unprecedented action of boycotting Courses and
Careers Day.</p>

<p>"Auckland academics have, for nine months,
made one very simple and reasonable request - to be able to
keep their employment conditions the way they are and to get
on with their job," said Dr Grey.</p>

<p>"For nine months, their
employer has not listened, or compromised, while staff have
suggested a myriad of reasonable alternatives to the
university's proposal to remove key employment conditions
from their collective agreement. Now they have no option but
to increase their level of industrial action, starting with
a boycott of Courses and Careers Day."</p>

<p>"The University of
Auckland is rightly proud of the reputation its current
staff built for it with their current employment conditions.
It is unreasonable to take those conditions away for no
reason," said Dr Grey.</p>
