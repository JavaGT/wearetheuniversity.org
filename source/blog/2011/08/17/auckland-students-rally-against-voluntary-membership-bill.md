         Auckland students rally against Roy’s voluntary membership
bill </p><p> </p><p>Auckland University students are rallying today
against the National governments’ continuing support of
ACT MP Heather Roy’s private members bill on voluntary
membership of students’ associations (VSM). An open
student meeting and a high wire banner unveiling stunt are
planned in the Student Union quad for 1.00pm today. </p><p>
</p><p>Membership of AUSA is currently voluntary, but students
are urging the Prime Minister John key and National MPs not
to support ACT’s destructive VSM bill. </p><p> </p><p>Auckland
University Students’ Association President Joe McCrory
will be speaking at the rally today. “Auckland students
voted for voluntary membership 12 years ago in 1999, when
the current group of first year students was starting
primary school” McCrory said. </p><p> </p><p>“12 years of
voluntary membership at Auckland University shows that
students are missing out on the full complement of vital
student services available at the smaller Victoria or Otago
campuses. Now the choice to vote on which system they prefer
is being removed by Heather Roy’s bill. A compromise would
allow the students who wish to opt-out of membership of
their association being able to, without the massive loss of
representation that this bill represents,” McCrory said.
</p><p> </p><p>“Students at the rally today will hear, among other
things, about the new Student Union renovations that
students have decided to build with their membership fees at
Victoria University, while facilities at Auckland are
increasingly sub-standard ” McCrory said. </p><p> </p><p>“The
Prime Minister should consider what the real cost of ACT’s
VSM agenda will be,” McCrory concluded. </p><p> </p><p>ENDS
