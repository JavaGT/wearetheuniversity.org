<center><h3>PM should experience VSM first hand, say
Auckland students</h3></center><p>Students at the University
of Auckland this morning have called for Prime Minister John
Key to visit the premises of the Auckland University
Students’ Association (AUSA), and see for himself the
effects of voluntary students’ association membership
(VSM).</p>

<p>Membership of AUSA is currently voluntary,
but students are urging the Prime Minister not to support
ACT’s destructive VSM bill.</p>

<p>AUSA President Joe
McCrory was standing outside the University’s Fale
Pasifika building as the Prime Minister hosted the Pacific
Leader's Forum Lecture Series.</p>

<p>“National should
listen to students, and forge a lasting compromise on
student association membership” McCrory said.<p>

<p>“AUSA has been voluntary since 1999, and the lack of
services compared to other, smaller, universities shows that
students are being shortchanged by this ideological crusade
by the ACT Party. National can retain student choice as well
as strong community institutions like AUSA by supporting
opt-out membership, where the small minority of students who
oppose advocacy and representation can choose not to join
without the majority losing their culture and their
voice,” McCrory said.</p>

<p>“We’re asking National
to be rational and drop ACT’s bill. John Key can ensure
that student life remains vibrant and inclusive,” McCrory
said.</p>

<p>AUSA will be sending another formal invitation
to John Key to visit the campus again this week.</p>

<p>“We hope that the Prime Minister will see for himself
the consequences of ACT’s VSM nightmare,” McCrory
concluded.</p>
