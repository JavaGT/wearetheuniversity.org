<p><b>'Business as Usual' Not Realistic for Canterbury
Academics</b> <b></b> </p>

<p>The Tertiary Education Commission
has told academics today at the University of Canterbury,
Lincoln University and CPIT that it will be business as
usual for their Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF)
quality evaluations. PBRF is the funding mechanism that the
commission uses to allocate research money to tertiary
institutions. It is worth tens of millions of dollars to
individual institutions and requires academics to submit
portfolios of their research upon which their institution is
ranked, and then funded. </p>

<p>TEU has argued since the
Canterbury earthquake in September that academics based in
Canterbury, who have had to take a significant amount of
time away from their core research, to help both their
friends and family, as well as their institutions, get back
on their feet are at a disadvantage to their peers in other
parts of the country.</p>

<p>TEU has provided the commission with
a range of simple, viable alternative approaches to PBRF, so
that academics in Canterbury would not need to meet 100
percent of their PBRF targets. However, today the commission
has ruled all those out.</p>

<p>TEU national president Sandra
Grey says that it is outrageous.</p>

<p>"Academics' reputations
and career prospects are tied up in PBRF performance," says
Dr Grey. "It's simply not realistic to expect Christchurch
academics to carry on as if nothing unusual has happened in
the last eight months and have them submit quality
evaluations as per
normal."</p>
