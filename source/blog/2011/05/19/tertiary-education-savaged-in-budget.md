         Media Release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>19 May
2011</p><p><strong>Tertiary education savaged in
budget</strong></p><p>The Finance Minister Bill English said
today that the government would invest about $3 billion into
health and education alone. However, the reality is that
tertiary education funding has been savaged. </p><p>The Budget
Economic and Fiscal Update shows total spending on tertiary
education falling by at least $200 million per year, or over
4 percent. (BEFU 19 May 2011, B.2 and B.3 page 177).</p><p>In
2010 the government invested $4.5 billion in tertiary
education. In 2011 it forecasts it will spend $4.2 billion.
By 2014 and 2015 this will have fallen even further to
$4.145 billion. It is not just student loan funding that has
been cut. Over the next four years, there are also cuts to
tuition funding, student allowances and other
funding.</p><p>"That means that polytechnics, universities and
wānanga are going to struggle to give new students the
opportunities they need to learn," says TEU national
president Dr Sandra Grey. " It means that lecture theatres,
tutorials and workshops will be crammed with more students
and fewer staff. And it means that student fees will
continue to rise beyond the reach of the people we most want
to give the chance to
learn."</p><p>ENDS<br>
