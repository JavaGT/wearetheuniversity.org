<p><b>University of Auckland Confiscates Graduation
Rosettes</b> <i><b></b></i> </p>

<p>Staff and students were
shocked yesterday at the Law and Arts Graduation ceremony
when university officials barred entry to the ceremony to
one of the Universityâ€™s top-achieving students.</p>

<p>Vernon
Tava, who graduated with first class honours, Masters in
Law, was told to remove the small yellow rosette pinned to
his regalia which called for staff and students to unite to
defend the university.</p>

<p>The rosette was part of a staff and
student campaign to prevent the vice-chancellor removing
important academic conditions of work from their collective
employment agreement.</p>

<p>Tava was told that unless he removed
his rosette his degree would be withheld and he would be
prevented from crossing the stage. When he refused to
surrender the rosette he was threatened with disciplinary
action.</p>

<p>Tava says, "When I pointed out that there were no
grounds for them preventing me from entering the theatre, a
male member of staff put a restraining hand on my chest and
another official asked rhetorically, 'would you like us to
search your pockets Sir?'"</p>

<p>This altercation occurred in
the context of a long-running dispute between the
vice-chancellor and staff about key academic conditions of
employment, which affect how academics do their teaching and
research and engage with the wider community.</p>

<p>Many other
students and administrative staff wanted to wear the
rosettes to show solidarity with academic staff, but were
ordered not to.</p>

<p>In contrast an estimated 95 percent of
academic staff wore the rosettes during the
ceremony.</p>
