<p></p><center><h3>Students and staff shocked by
University bullying at graduation</h3></center><p>Students
and staff at the University of Auckland have been shocked
this week by University staff threatening to block a top
student from attending his graduation ceremony for wearing a
rosette.<p>

<p>Vernon Tava, who was graduating Masters of Law
with first class honours, was told by graduation officials
he would not be permitted to enter the hall while wearing a
yellow rosette.<p>

<p>The rosette relates to a joint campaign
from the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and the Auckland
University Students’ Association (AUSA) to persuade the
Vice-Chancellor to retain important academic conditions in
their collective employment agreement.<p>

<p>“I was told
that the rosette wasn’t appropriate for a meeting of the
university council, and that I wouldn’t be crossing the
stage and graduating if it was not removed,” Tava said.<p>

<p>AUSA President Joe McCrory, a member of the University
Council, wore a rosette on stage as part of the official
party.<p>

<p>“Students felt intimidated, with many thinking
they would be unable to graduate for wearing the
rosettes,” McCrory said.<p>

<p>“The threats made by
university officials present a massive affront to freedom of
expression,” McCrory said.<p>

<p>“The rosettes weren’t
disruptive, but the bullying of graduates by university
staff certainly was. The University of Auckland should be
ashamed for treating graduates in this way,” McCrory said.<p>

<p>Students who felt intimidated or threatened by graduation
staff are asked to contact AUSA confidentially on rosette@ausa.org.nz.<p>

<p>“AUSA will be
working on behalf of students to seek an official apology
from the University of Auckland for their disgraceful
conduct,” McCrory concluded.<p>
