         <b>Occupy Auckland University to negotiate
demands</b></p><p>Occupation seems to be the new popular form of
protest on small and large scales. University students in
both Auckland and Wellington have done their own occupations
to protest fee increases and programme cuts. The ongoing one
at the University of Auckland is getting dramatic. Scoop
received the following communication from Hala Nasr of
WeAreTheUniversity at around 4.10pm today:</p><p>Around 100
people are marching against fees that are being raised at
the University of Auckland. Currently we have occupied the
council room in the clock tower. Weâ€™re going to hold a
General Assembly to discuss demands, which include free
education and the demilitarization of the campus. There are
a group of police officers with dog handlers outside the
clock
tower.</p><p>ENDS
