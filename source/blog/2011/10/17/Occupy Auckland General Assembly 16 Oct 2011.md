the university clocktown there's 55
people and they're currently speaking
with the
security guards about the situation i've
been told that um they can leave but if
they leave they can't come back in and
the guys are dedicated and they're going
to stick to it and i've got 10 demands
which are
demands are one free education
unconditional two sac mccutcheon and
walsh as acting vice chancellors and
restructure university university into a
public forum three remove trespass on
marcus and wiki
four ask for ngati far to a blessing
five decisions on courses based on
scholarly and social benefits rather
than financial needs six security guards
employed for the safety of students and
not surveillance and cops and no cops on
campus
and cops not to be called in response
number seven the university should be
bound by the government's facilitation
with the involvement of the teachers
the tertiary education union eight the
university to work to remove the
voluntary student movement bill and nine
government fund um the government funds
student unions unconditionally with nine
demands
thank you our 10th demand was free pizza
thank you
i heard a rumor that the security don't
know what the [ __ ] to do
got you a lot of food
got heaps of food
i'm just going to tie it up with my pad
okay that should hold it's really heavy
that's okay
so i'm bruce kaine from sociology um
just come from the clock tower where
students and staff are occupying um the
uh room uh there's about um what 40
people
left in the building um planning an
indefinite occupation from what i can
make out
um
we've had collective decision making
and we've also talked about
various things such as going across the
library forum
obviously solidarity people out here
with the um
uh with the global occupations taking
place uh in auckland centre and so forth
but yeah um it's continuing and uh
spirits are high they've got food
security are backing off
i've seen the vice chancellor by the way
just on on the first floor there looking
very concerned um and yeah um i think
all is looking good yeah don't know how
long they're gonna stay there
thank you
excuse me
okay so now we are sitting here outside
the cloth tower and we are
doing this as a sign of solidarity with
the students presently occupying the
clock tower
we are doing this because of
our protests against fees rising
alongside as was said earlier vice
chancellor salaries um and now we're
just waiting for the police
to carry us off students and staff in
solidarity with other students and staff
what we're protesting what we're opposed
to is a rise in fees economies in
shambles it's the fault of the
politicians the bankers and the
investors and they're making students
pay for it so we're here to say hell no
if you're getting a rise in the salary
and rise in pay as the vc just did then
we're sure as hell getting a reduction
in student fees
the university

message across and now we're going to
