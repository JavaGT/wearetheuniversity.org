what has to change is our economic
system
that works for a tiny minority of people
and excludes the majority so we need
dramatic radical economic training
that's going to put the wealth that's
created in the country in the hands of
the people who create the wealth instead
of being siphoned off to a very small
number of very wealthy people i mean
last year the 150 wealthiest new
zealanders received seven billion
dollars extra in income now that's
obscene in a country where we've got
people
as i say coal communities living in
poverty
foreign
ecological disaster in our country
because of deregulation
foreign
what you gonna do what
