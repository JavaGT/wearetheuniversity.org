Protesters occupy Queen Street in Aotearoa Auckland New Zealand 1 Oct 2011

---

we are here to show the railroad on new
zealand
that there are many issues affecting us
in this little
this little country of ours and then we
want to show you the rural new zealand
the royal altar or new zealand cure
everybody there's a tribe of people in
this nation who are living in abject
poverty
we have half a million people on
benefits
are out of work we also have another
half a million people
workers who earn less than 15 an hour
and many of those people are working on
this street of wealth
in every starbucks in every mcdonald's
in every kfc in this city people who
want to work hard
but he can't pay high prices he can't
afford gst increases
that junkie lied about people who are
trying to feed their children
300 000 children in this country
living in poverty and this is a crime
this is a crime because the 150 richest
people
in this country last year between them
got an extra an extra
seven billion dollars if we took that
money off them
and one day we will we could
give every worker in new zealand a job
at 30 hours a week on 35
an hour that's what we have to start
demanding in our country
and finally as we walk up this street of
wealth
and the street of poverty and you look
at the banks
and you look at the fast food outlets
that exploit our people
think about one thing all over the
united states of america today
in every city from chicago to los
angeles to miami
small groups of people like us are
occupying
the cbd and occupying the financial
districts
we need to bring this war to john king
in the middle of this swampy world cup
we should occupy queen street
in solidarity with this people's
movement against capitalism
what are occ gonna do we do solemnly
declare
that the salivating and celebrating jaws
of the commonwealth
have been the causal link connecting
iron fisted crown clauses
to our lands waterways and resources
ripped and torn asunder we the native
down under
now confined to the spaces hammered
between the lines or worse
to save from the sun as living in
australia must inevitably
one day become okay
everybody well we've got the
we've got a lot of organizations out
here raising a lot of really important
issues today
and this is the best place to be in new
zealand today
so let's have a big cheer for everybody
on this hikoi
well done people you all made a really
good decision today to come here
because you're representing the many
people in new zealand who are having
not just a hard go not just a hard time
but are suffering acutely in a land of
plenty
so yeah this is the real new zealand
represented here on this march
we're representing the people who are
living in poverty
in new zealand we've got 200 000
children plus
living in poverty and what is the
wealthiest country
certainly in this part of the world
we've got
many people living on benefits as has
been said before
and this country is in crisis it's in
crisis because for a past generation
we have allowed a tiny number of people
to gain extreme
wealth at the expense of the majority
and as joe said
last year just 150 people
in new zealand just 150 had an
increase in wealth of 7 billion
dollars and some of those people
actually think they deserve it
they actually think they earned it but
we've got these parasitic bludgers at
the top
and the majority of people struggling
well we are going to change that we are
going to change that
and one of the ways that i'm personally
involved in helping to change that is
looking at what's happening in
parliament
you know a generation ago
parliamentarians were paid
about the same wage as or the same
income
as a deputy principal of a
of a primary school now at the moment
a deputy principal of a primary school
now earns about seventy thousand
what does a back bench mpu 120 130
000 so mps have leveraged themselves
into the top two percent of income
earners in the country
and so they're not interested in putting
taxes on people
on high incomes even labor is talking
about putting taxes on people
who are earning over 150 000 so that all
the mps in his party
won't have to pay any extra tax and if
you look at mps also
you find 70 of mps own more than one
property
mps are not interested in capital gains
taxes that are going to take away their
wealth
so we've got mps pushing themselves up
into that tiny group at the top that are
incredibly wealthy
so what we've got to do i'm standing for
mana this year and i think mana is going
to bring some real change to that system
kill all you mana supporters out there
okay so it's really good to see you all
here
it's good to see you taking part in the
sequoia as i said this is the most
important thing that's happening in new
zealand today
forget about the bloody rugby matches
because what
we're talking about are policies that
don't
that don't look at people just for the
extent of a rugby match but look at the
whole lives of people
and the whole lives of people in new
zealand are being crushed and destroyed
by this extreme
separation between rich and poor because
of policies which are being followed by
this government
so good on you for being here give
yourselves another big round of applause
and this have a few chance to really
rock the street okay
when people's rights are under attack
stand up
fight back when people's rights are
under attack
but women's rights are under attack
a woman's
workers rights
people's rights are under attack
but people's rights are under attack
thank you very much the issue i'm going
to raise is child poverty
in our country we have a beautiful land
full of food and resources
but about 20 of our children are living
in poverty
child poverty action has been
campaigning for years and so
many other organizations the wealth of
this country needs to be shared so our
children
can live with a decent standard of
living
housing health so they can access
the resources in schools so they have a
chance in life
and so should they
right to then they're taking away our
strength this street
named queen street does not belong to
the queen
but it's really not the colonization
that has never
ended in this country it started out
with the colonization of european coming
over
now it's just economic colonization and
the colonization of maori people and
indigenous people everywhere
will not end as long as we live under
the system of capitalism
that put profit over people this is
not the queen street this is not john k
street this is owl street
we work with people who are so
impoverished that they don't even know
that a lettuce grows in the garden they
think it comes out of the new world
supermarket or pack and
save so when we talk about our people
being in poverty we are in poverty
we are starving in terms of food we are
starving in terms of knowledge
everything that used to be ours has been
taken from us
capitalized and globalized
i just want to mention the significance
of this location for this rugby world
cup
our council has paid private security
companies
to clear homeless people
that they have been put into their
paying
private security companies to clear them
off the streets
these people live here they have nowhere
else to go
so now they're being prosecuted by
having nothing on monday we have to
fight the business school
because we know
the university is the place that is
financializing the world
it's where poverty is born and it's
where we can start to overcome it
we believe that the student body needs
to be politicized
that the student movement needs to be
joined with the workers movement
with the indigenous movement and with
all social justice movements in this
country
i'm here today to burn the food bill
the proposed food bill when i was
growing up and that was way up in the
hook yanga
my mother we had a big garden we're out
there every day
i actually used to be quite pissed off
because i thought it was very hard work
and i didn't understand really what she
was doing
but when it came time to harvest we fed
all our queer our ko matua we fed our
hospital
we fed everybody that came to our house
and they all enjoyed
the produce that we that came out of our
garden
if this food bill goes through they
intend to stop that they tell you
they tell you that they're not going to
do that that
that won't stop us from sharing our kai
from sharing our seeds
but a natural fact it is a start to that
process
so we must be proactive and we must be
activists and stand up for our
needs to rights strongly opposed to this
build
we all know where the real cameras need
to go
which is in our corporate board rooms
that's where the cameras need to go
retrospective legislation
is not a good look for any country
one minute what the police are doing is
illegal
next minute it isn't
the search and surveillance bill is not
good
for any new zealanders we're on our way
to a police state to fascism
that we do not want all new zealanders
need to stand strong against this bill
and don't give in to the scare mongering
that is telling you that we need this
bill
for 40 or 50 plus criminal cases
that are currently in the line there are
already criminal acts of law that can
help
that process as per normal
don't listen to the scaremongering which
says
your livelihood depends on having these
cameras
to be unreasonable looking at what
reasonably looking at what you are doing
let's
burn it see these tall banks that asb up
there
a tsb there that national down there
that chase manhattan down the bottom of
the road
in america they can have 10 reserves
they have to have 10 of what they loan
you that means if they make a loan to
you eight percent
they're really making eighty percent in
new zealand
they need a zero percent lending ratio
zero
they have to have nothing behind them to
load hundreds of billions of dollars out
if you owe more money than you have how
do you ever pay them back if i owe six
dollars on this five dollars
how the hell can i pay them back it's
not about people have a job
it's about mathematical and that's why
the whole world is in debt
that's why the whole world has more debt
than more
currency than more liquidity than
liquidity
how can you have the whole world out of
balance a shop over there has to balance
the perks of the balance
how can we have more debt than credit in
a whole
planet we could have 40 planets
working fully employed and we still
would not pay back the debt
we have to change the system we have to
have nations that issue their own money
supply
this is why america went to war against
the brits this is why they killed the
red coats
people need to learn this stuff they
can't tax us into prosperity
they can't keep stealing from us the
rich avoid the taxes the poor need to do
the same
we need to take the banks back we need
to own our own credit
otherwise we're a company not a nation
thank you
