         <b>Staff say they will defend UC for
Cantabrians</b></p><p>Hundreds of TEU members denounced the
possibility of forced jobs cuts at Canterbury University
this week and committed themselves to campaign to protect
and promote education for local Canterbury people.</p><p>A large
crowd of TEU members gathered at a stop-work meeting this
week and passed a resolution that they "are here to educate
and support the people of Canterbury and we commit to
campaign and do all we can to protect our university and all
its staff and students." TEU members at the university are
also currently voting on a further series of resolutions
that say that any changes to the university should enhance
the quality and range of courses offered to students, and
that decisions about any changes be made in a truly
democratic way that involves staff who are fully informed
with sufficient information.</p><p>The university's
vice-chancellor, Dr Rod Carr, who told Radio New Zealand on Friday "there is
no proposal [for job cuts] at the moment" sent an email to
all staff calling for voluntary redundancies on Monday, just
before staff attended their stop-work meeting.</p><p>On Friday
Dr Carr said:</p><p>“What we don't know, and we won't know, is
where there are rationalisations of courses within
programmes - where we may be able to, instead of having
twelve flavours, have eight flavours. We may require staff
to teach four courses instead of three courses. But the
impact on the actual programmes we offer will be quite
modest."

<p>"These are staff who are very committed to their
university and their city,” said TEU national president
Sandra Grey. "They have stayed through a very difficult time
and worked in extraordinary ways for their students and the
city. The university and the government cannot cast them
aside now. The university, its academic reputation and the
city will all suffer if that is the path the university and
the government take. There must be no forced job cuts as a
result of the earthquake."</p><p><b>Also in Tertiary Update this
week:</b></p><p>1.	Massey proposes end to undergraduate teacher
education <br>2.	<br>3.	TEU opposes Aoraki closures across South
Island <br>4.	<br>5.	Government spinning wrong story from crises
not sure this makes sense <br>6.	<br>7.	Academics disagree on Freedom Day
<br>8.	<br>9.	Other news <br>10.	</p><p><b>Massey proposes
end to undergraduate teacher education</b></p><p>Trainee and
beginning teachers are angry over proposed changes to
teacher training programmes at Massey University.</p><p>In a
paper entitled "College of Education Academic Reform", the
university is proposing radical change to initial teacher
education. It proposes to discontinue all undergraduate
teacher education by cutting its three-year Bachelor of
Education Early Years degree and the four-year Bachelor of
Education Primary. That would mean students could only study
teacher education through a one year, graduate diploma.</p><p>It
is also proposing to merge the Massey University College of
Education into an Institute of Education beneath the College
of Humanities and Social Sciences, with an increased focus
on attracting post-graduate research. This move may threaten
the jobs of teaching staff involved in initial teacher
education, who aren’t classed as
"research-active".</p><p>Young and new members of the teachers'
union NZEI Te Riu Roa believe the proposals could be
incredibly damaging to teacher education in New Zealand.
Jennifer Langridge, currently studying a graduate diploma
through Massey says "although post graduate study can
produce quality teachers, post-graduate students often agree
that the pressure-cooker situation of being pushed through
training and out into the 'real world' often leads them to
be burnt out and feel under-prepared in some areas of the
classroom."</p><p>NZEI says is wants to see the university
challenge the growing assumption that post-graduate research
is superior to undergraduate teaching.</p><p>However Massey
University spokesman James Gardiner said the proposed
changes create "an exciting opportunity to position
Massey University's teacher education as an international
leader."</p><p>"It also proposes new pathways into postgraduate
education that will lead to more highly qualified teachers
who are effective professionals and professional leaders
throughout their lives."</p><p>Mr Gardiner said international
evidence suggested the best outcomes would be achieved by
providing teacher education to those who already had
undergraduate degrees.</p><p>"What is proposed is by no means a
radical change – we have numerous excellent teachers in
the profession now who have completed one-year graduate
diplomas ... having first completed undergraduate degrees,"
Mr Gardiner said.</p><p><b>TEU opposes Aoraki closures across
South Island</b></p><p>TEU members from the Dunedin, Timaru,
Ashburton, Christchurch and Oamaru campuses of Aoraki
Polytechnic have vowed to fight planned programme closures
they say are detrimental to students, the communities they
work in, and their institution.</p><p>Aoraki Polytechnic told
staff a fortnight ago of proposals that would close a range
of programmes across all five communities. Twenty jobs are
under threat, and several hundred potential students could
lose a place of study if the changes go ahead.</p><p>TEU
national president Sandra Grey was at a stop-work meeting in
Timaru where Aoraki staff discussed current collective
agreement negotiations and the proposed changes. She said
staff see no justification for the proposed
closures.</p><p>“These are professionals committed to quality
tertiary education provision in their communities. They are
committed to protecting their communities’ rights to
access teaching and learning at all levels,” said Dr
Grey.</p><p>TEU members will be making submissions to Aoraki
senior management on the proposed changes and will be
working with students and members of the public to do the
same.</p><p>Meanwhile Film and Television students in Dunedin
are also organising to oppose the closures. One
former student, 'Jonty' told the Facebook group Save Aoraki Polytechnic Courses if it
wasn't for doing Web Design &amp; Advertising Design last year
he would not be where he is today.</p><p>"The staff were great,
they made me feel like I was part of a team, this course
gave me life. I truly felt like I belonged there. I think
about other people that may be just like I was two years
ago, knew what they wanted to do with their life. But
because of their past, not having any school qualifications,
they can't get into any other course. I'm doing a degree at
Otago Polytechnic now, and it's going great. But if I hadn't
gone to Aoraki first I would be like a lost dog in the
jungle. Closing down Aoraki simply isn't an
option."</p><p><b>Government spinning wrong story from
crises</b></p><p>CTU economist and policy director Bill
Rosenberg says the government has used a series of crises -
such as the worst global financial crisis and recession for
decades, crashing local finance companies, leaky homes,
devastating earthquakes in Canterbury, the Pike River
tragedy, and now another international financial crisis - to
spin a story of 'there is no alternative' to cuts.  The
government has held, then cut, spending when a more generous
programme was affordable and could have held down
unemployment and prevented stagnation. </p><p>Dr Rosenberg says
delays in rebuilding Christchurch and further turmoil
overseas are now looking likely. </p><p>"The government will try
to spin the same story: these are beyond its control; the
best it can do is keep the government’s books in order,
and trust that “the market” will pull us through. But as
always, it does have choices as to how it responds."</p><p>Dr
Rosenberg argues the government's programme to a progressive
earthquake levy, targeted to be higher for those with higher
incomes, could have funded the rebuild of Christchurch. He
also says it is not doing enough to support education and
training needs following the crises:</p><p>"[The government] has
announced a welcome $42 million education and training
programme but is failing to build the excitement that would
attract people to this unique opportunity to get new skills
when jobs will be plentiful – in a great project. Too much
of the work will go to skilled workers from overseas rather
than developing our own skills." </p><p><b>Academics disagree on
Freedom Day </b></p><p>Yesterday the world celebrated
International Academic Freedom Day. Or maybe it wasn't.
Fittingly, it seems academics cannot agree when to celebrate
academic freedom.</p><p>The advocacy organisation Scholars at Risk celebrates
International Academic Freedom Day in solidarity with, and
on the occasion of, World Teachers’ Day, 5 October. Since
1994 when it was created by UNESCO, World Teachers’ Day
celebrates and aims to mobilise support for educators at all
levels and to ensure quality education for future
generations. At the higher education level, Scholars at Risk
and partners worldwide use this day to call increased
attention to the importance of core university
values—including academic freedom, institutional autonomy,
access, accountability, social responsibility and respect
for human rights—not only for the education sector, but
for all members of society. A day celebrating these values
encourages greater public understanding and public
responsibility for defending the educational space at all
levels.</p><p>However, the  group Academics For Academic Freedom (AFAF) 
launched International Academic Freedom Day on 1 February in
2009 and have had three years of holding successful events.
Their International Academic Freedom Day is linked to the
publication (as close as records give us) of John Stuart
Mill's <i>'On Liberty'</i>, which was 1 February 1859.
</p><p>Meanwhile a third International Academic Freedom Day is
held on  what used to be 'Darwin Day', Charles Darwin's birthday
(February 12), with advocates of that day encouraging
students everywhere to speak out against censorship and
stand up for free speech by defending the right to debate
the evidence for and against evolution.</p><p><b>Other news
</b></p><p>In the latest Auckland University staff magazine,
UniNews, Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon said academics

Keep MMP spokesperson Sandra Grey said that if a majority of
voters opt to keep MMP at this year’s referendum, it would
lock in an independent review by the Electoral Commission to
hear from the public about improvements that can be made to
our current system. “We know that aspects of MMP irk some
people, who otherwise broadly support a voting system where
everyone’s votes count equally, no matter where they live.
It is important that not only supporters of MMP, but
supporters of MMP with some tweaks, vote to keep MMP this
November" - Campaign for MMP</p><p>A proposed operations
