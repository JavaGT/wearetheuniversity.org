         Surpluses at public institutions raise questions about
priorities </p><p>Ministry of Education statistics  show the average surplus as
a percentage of revenue at public tertiary education
providers climbing dramatically from 1.9 percent in 2006 to
5.2 percent last year. </p><p>In 2006 public tertiary education
providers made a combined surplus of $66 million on revenue
of $3.5 billion. Last year the same institutions made a
combined surplus of $280 million on revenue of $4.4 billion.
</p><p>Public tertiary institutions are supposed to meet a
benchmark surplus of 3 percent of revenue each year. By
exceeding that benchmark by a further 2.2 percent last year
the institutions pocketed nearly $100 million dollars more
than they were required to. </p><p>"The large surplus last year
does not seem to be a one-off aberration according to TEU
National Secretary Sharn Riggs. "The average surpluses have
grown steadily each year since 2006." </p><p>The public
institutions that have generated the largest surpluses as
percentages of revenue include Waiariki (16 percent) Te
Whare Wnanga o Awanuirangi and SIT (13 percent each), WITT
and UCOL (12 percent each), the Open Polytechnic, CPIT and
Bay of Plenty Polytechnic (11 percent each). </p><p>"While we
commend these institutions on careful and prudent
management, we need to remember that surplus money is money
that could have been spend saving jobs, teaching students
and protecting quality education," said Ms Riggs. </p><p>"Too
many good people have lost their jobs, gone without pay
rises or been told to turn away students because of tight
fiscal circumstances. It is galling to see that those
circumstances were not so tight after all."
