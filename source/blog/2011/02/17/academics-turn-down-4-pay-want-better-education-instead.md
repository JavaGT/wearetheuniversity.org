<center><h3>Academics turn down 4 percent
pay, want better education
instead</h3></center><p>Protecting the quality of teaching
and research may cost academic staff at the University of
Auckland a pay rise but they’re prepared to make this
trade-off and use industrial action to achieve it.</p>

<p>At
meetings across every campus at the University of Auckland,
academic staff are exasperated at their employer for trying
to take away conditions crucial to doing their job well. The
university is offering a 4 percent pay-rise, which academics
have said they would rather not take if it means they lose
key conditions from their employment agreements.</p>

<p>The vice
chancellor is proposing to move key conditions out of the
collective agreement and into university policy.</p>

<p>TEU
national president Sandra Grey says staff cannot believe
that their vice chancellor is trying to buy out staff with a
4% pay rise provided he is able to make major changes to
their collective agreement.</p>

<p>Associate professor Alexandra
Sims from the University of Auckland, says the changes would
leave staff without any say over conditions which are
fundamental to their roles. For example one condition is
around managing their research.</p>

<p>"We want to ensure that
students’ qualifications at Auckland are still highly
sought after and we can only do this if our teaching is
informed by research."</p>

<p>University of Auckland senior
lecturer Dr Kim Dirks says their vice chancellor repeatedly
says he wants Auckland to be the number one university in
New Zealand.</p>

<p>"Staff are telling the vice chancellor that
if they are forced to let go of these important conditions
of work, then attracting first-class academics and
postgraduate students will be much
harder."</p>
