<p>Speak Up for Education rally on Monday before election<p>

<p>Hundreds of teachers and students will converge on
Wellington's Cuba Mall on the Monday before the election to
tell politicians it is time to speak up for education.<p>

<p>-
Cuba Mall - 21 November - 5pm - 5.45pm<p>

<p>TEU's singing
National President Dr Sandra Grey and her band Tolley and
the Folly-Dollies will lead a line-up that includes:<p>

<p>-
Louise Green, principal of Khandallah School (tambourines).
A National Standards system forced into schools is bad for
children's learning. - Kevin Bunker, PPTA general secretary
(doo-wop vocals). Investing in smaller class sizes in public
education is critical to learning. - Robyn Hambleton,
Wellington High School adult community education deputy
director (saxaphone). The government cut community and adult
education in schools by 80 percent in 2009. - National
student president David Do (ukelele). Despite growing
student numbers tertiary education has had its funding cut
each budget under this government and more cuts are
forecast. - Actor and theatre producer Julia Truscott will
MC the event.<p>

<p>"We'll be loud and we'll be singing. We'll
be telling politicians of all persuasions and predilections
that it is time to speak up for education," says Dr Grey.<p>

<p>"Education is not a cost or a burden - it is the best
investment we can make in our people, young and old."<p>
