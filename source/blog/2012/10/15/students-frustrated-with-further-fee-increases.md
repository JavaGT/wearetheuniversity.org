<p><strong>Auckland University Students’
Association</strong><br>For immediate release.</p>

<p><strong>AUSA Media release: 15 October
2012</strong></p>

<p><strong>Students frustrated with further fee
increases</strong></p>

<p>Students have expressed their
frustration at the decision being taken by University of
Auckland Council’s to raise fees by the maximum 4%. For
many students, this amounts to an increase of several
hundred dollars for their 2013 fees. The fee increase means
that student fees have increased by the maximum level for
the past five years.</p>

<p>“What we’re seeing with these
increases is the failure of central government to properly
support our universities” said Auckland University
Students’ Association (AUSA) President, Arena Williams.
“While universities are struggling to keep their heads
above water in a dynamic global environment, government
funding is stalling. Instead, they are being told to squeeze
more money out of students. If New Zealand wants to continue
to be a world leader in education, government has to come to
the party.”</p>

<p>The average increase in tuition subsidies
from the government this year was 1.2%, while for some
courses, such as Arts and Commerce, it was 0%. The effective
increase in University costs was 3.7%. Meanwhile, the
University of Auckland’s ranking on global measures, such
as the Times Higher Education Supplement and QS Rankings,
continues to fall, as does the long-term rankings of all
other New Zealand universities.</p>

<p>“Increasing fees has a
real effect on those trying to enter the tertiary education
system,” said Nate Amato-Ali, President-elect of Auckland
University Pacific Island Students’ Association (AUPISA).
“This is particularly true when the government has
restricted access to student support for many students,
including postgraduates, solo parents and recent migrants. A
system that allows these fee increases is shutting out those
who have the potential to do well, but can’t afford
to.”<p>
<p>AUSA has called on the University of Auckland to
send a clear message to the Minister for Tertiary Education
Steven Joyce that relentless year-on-year fee increases are
unsustainable. “Universities can’t keep passing the buck
to students. New Zealanders have always prided themselves on
a world-class tertiary education system that gives everyone
a fair go. If that’s what we want, we need to see more
support from the government”, Williams
said.</p>
