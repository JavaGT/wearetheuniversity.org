<p><br><strong>Waikato general staff win new pay
rates</strong></p>

<p>TEU organiser Megan Morris hopes a new
collective agreement at the University of Waikato will make
it easier for general staff to seek and gain higher rates of
pay. The collective agreements include two pay increases of
1.2 percent each over the two-year term, and a $300 lump sum
payment. The big improvement for general staff however is
new minimum rates in two of their pay scales and new minimum
and maximum pay rates in the three higher levels of pay
scales.</p>

<p><strong>Global
conference denounces proliferation of ‘taxi-cab’
professors</strong></p>

<p>Casualisation in tertiary education is
becoming a big issue worldwide, according to TEU national
president Sandra Grey who has just returned from Education
International’s Higher Education and Research Conference
in Buenos Aires. Tertiary education union leaders there told
how in Latin America, excluding Brazil, nearly 80 percent of
academics are so-called “taxi-cab” professors. That is,
they get jobs on a temporary and often per-course basis and
are forced to shuttle between different institutions in an
attempt to earn a living.<p>

<p><strong>Academic freedom
is a campaign not a right</strong><p>

<p>Tomorrow is World
Teachers’ Day and Academic Freedom Day but, sadly,
academic freedom remains a value to aspire to rather than a
reality. Columbian academic Dr Miguel Ángel Beltrán
Villegas was prosecuted for his academic work and went to
jail for two years without trial, during which he suffered
torture and other bad treatment. In 2011, he was released
for lack of evidence to support the charges against him of
“rebellion” and “conspiracy”.</p>

<p><strong>World watches
NZ’s performance measures</strong></p>

<p>Tertiary unions
around the world are watching New Zealand’s plunge into
goal-setting, performance management, accountability, and
auditing of the education sector to see what it means for
them. TEU president Sandra Grey says countries all over the
world are extolling the virtues of performance based-funding
and external accountability measures in the education
sector, but New Zealand has done more than most to impose
these New Public Management accounting techniques onto its
education system.</p>

<p><strong>Union membership
pays off for kiwis</strong></p>

<p>Pay increases in collectives
over the last 20 years have been markedly higher than
employees in general have received. CTU economist Bill
Rosenberg has been reading the latest data from the
Industrial Relations Centre at Victoria University and says
it makes a compelling case for belonging to a union.</p>

<p><strong>Extramural
students claim tertiary strategy is
biased</strong></p>

<p>Massey’s extramural students’
association (EXMSS) believes the government’s Tertiary
Education Strategy is pushing school leavers to take on
study debt rather than gain valuable employment skills, life
experience and resources in preparation for a
well-considered education choice.</p>
