         Tertiary Education Union<br>Media release<br>24 October
2012<br><strong>Govt funding cuts to blame for losing
learning
opportunities</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p>Several
polytechnics are about to announce reviews that will see
students lose foundation level courses and staff lose
jobs.</p><p>The restructuring and cuts will follow the
government’s decision in May this year to introduce
competitive funding for level 1 and 2 courses, and then,
through its Tertiary Education Commission, direct that
funding away from publicly-owned polytechnics to cut-price
providers and private companies. The commission’s own
papers note that one of the criteria for deciding how it
awarded funding was ‘value for money’ rather than the
quality of the education on offer.</p><p>TEU president Sandra
Grey says that the government is abandoning learners when
they most need help. </p><p>"The government's policy is driving
first-time learners, second-chance learners and people in
regional communities out of our publicly-owned polytechnics
where they have a clear pathway to life-long learning and
job skills. It is asset stripping by another name, because
the government is taking away the very thing which makes our
public tertiary system so strong - its students and staff -
and giving them away to private companies."</p><p>“This
funding experiment is going horribly wrong. The Minister for
Tertiary Education Steven Joyce, needs to let people know
when he will review this competitive funding experiment, and
what criteria he will use measure this review,” said
Sandra
Grey.</p><p>
