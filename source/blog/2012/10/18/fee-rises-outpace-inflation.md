<p><br><strong>Fee Rises Outpace Inflation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professional
teaching fellows win a new collective
agreement</strong></p>

<p>Professional Teaching Fellows at the
University of Auckland can now belong to the Academic Staff
Collective Agreement at the university.  Until now
professional teaching fellows (PTFs) have all been on
individual agreements. TEU's negotiation team says the right
to belong to the collective agreement means those PTFs now
have clauses outlining rights around parental leave,
redundancy, disciplinary principles, health and safety,
promotion, professional development, workload and many other
employment conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Polytechnics
lose in L1-2 funding scramble</strong></p>

<p>The uneven way the
Tertiary Education Commission distributed its $38 million
level 1-2 funding available for tender means some
polytechnics will probably have to cut courses and
restructure or reorganise say TEU national president Sandra
Grey. WITT is the first polytechnic to speak out about the
funding , telling the <i>Taranaki Daily News</i> this
morning that Taranaki's unique Māori dialect may soon be
extinct with the loss of foundation-level funding to the
polytechnic.

<p><strong>REAP members
call for alternative education strategy</strong></p>

<p>"We had
one family on the East Coast where one member of the family
enrolled in a REAP programme and that led to three
generations of the family participating in adult education.
Four of the five family members have now graduated and
developed a love of learning. The grandfather, three
daughters, one son and one mokopuna all participating in
tertiary education through wānanga. This shows the
importance of learning amongst familiar people in a familiar
environment."</p>

<p>The State Services Commission released
details of remuneration for polytechnic chief executives and
vice-chancellors last week. Overall, there are a lot who
appear to either have taken a cut in pay, no pay rise or a
small pay rise that may be in line with what TEU members are
receiving. The vice-chancellor at University of Auckland has
fallen down one band of $10,000 to earn somewhere between
$630,000 and $639,999 but is still the highest paid public
servant in the country, ahead of the Prime Minister by quite
some margin - State Services Commission</p>

<p>“We have a
growing list of job losses, and as the Reserve Bank
acknowledged in its last Monetary Policy Statement, many
exporters and firms competing with imports are struggling. A
drop in interest rates could help stimulate investment and
be part of a strategy to bring down the exchange rate. In
turn, this could stimulate more job creation – or at least
slow the job losses,” - CTU Economist Bill Rosenberg</p>
