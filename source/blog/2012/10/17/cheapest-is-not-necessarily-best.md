         <strong>Cheapest is not necessarily
best</strong><br><strong></strong><br>Details of which
institutions received funding to provide level 1 and 2 tertiary
education courses next year show that the Tertiary
Education Commission is favouring those providers that have
promised to deliver the course for the cheapest, rather than
those which proposed to offer high quality courses.  </p><p>TEU
national president Sandra Grey says that we should not
assume because a course is cheaper, or delivered in bulk,
that it is best for our students.</p><p>Last month the minister
of tertiary education Steven Joyce announced that only six
polytechnics out of eighteen and only one wananga would
receive funding to tender funding to teach level 1-2 course
next year, but 17 for profit private providers would get
funding that had previously gone to publicly owned
polytechnics. </p><p>Today, when the commission released more
information about the successful tenders, it is clear that
one of the deciding factors was the ability of an
institution to teach its course more cheaply than its
competitors. </p><p>"If this competitive funding model continues
not only will we see more and more public eduction money in
the hands of private for profit companies," says Sandra
Grey, "but we will also see a downward spiral in quality as
polytechnics and wananga respond to the expectations of the
tertiary education quality and design courses that are cheap
rather than high
quality."</p><p>
