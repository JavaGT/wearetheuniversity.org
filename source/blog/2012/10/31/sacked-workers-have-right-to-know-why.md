         <strong>Sacked workers have right to know
why</strong></p><p>Last year TEU members won an important legal
case against Massey University that allowed workers who were
being sacked during a restructuring of their job to see the
information their employer was using to sack them.</p><p>But now
the government's suite of proposed employment law changes
includes a proposal to take that legal right away from
workers, so they won’t know why they lose their job.</p><p>The
High Court, in the <i>Wrigley and Kelly v Massey
University</i> case, rightly noted that this employment
right was an issue of procedural fairness.</p><p>All the
government's proposed changes to employment law are
abhorrent says TEU deputy secretary Nanette Cormack.</p><p>"They
take away workers’ rights and they will mean people lose
jobs, and that pay and conditions will be forced down even
further."</p><p>"But this particular change takes away an
important right that has meant many tertiary education
institutions have had to treat some of their staff more
fairly. Those employers now let individual staff know what
the criteria for cutting jobs are and, in some instances,
people’s jobs have been saved."</p><p>"While we agree that
there are privacy implications around sharing information,
and employees should not need to see information about other
employees, they should be allowed to see all their own
personal information, and information about why they are
being sacked. Otherwise they have no way of knowing if they
are being treated fairly or not," said Nanette
Cormack.</p><p><br>
