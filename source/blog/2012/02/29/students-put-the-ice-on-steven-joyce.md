<p>Media Release – 29 February 2012 – For Immediate
Use</p>

<p><strong>Students put the ice on Steven Joyce, Minister
of Tertiary Education.</strong></p>

<p>The Auckland University
Students' Association is welcoming University of Auckland
students back to campus during Orientation Week with a
dramatic stunt to highlight rising fees.</p>

<p>"Fees have risen
by 13% since 2007," says Dan Haines, Vice President of AUSA.
"Students are expected to take on incredible debts which
have a huge impact on their lives after graduation. As
graduate jobs are harder to come by, young people are
putting off buying houses and starting families because of
the massive debts hanging over their heads."</p>

<p>AUSA will be
displaying ice sculptures in the Quad today from 12pm,
embodying "frozen fees" and depicting the Minister of
Tertiary Education, Steven Joyce. "The Minister of Tertiary
Education has become somewhat of a symbol for fee rises for
us as students," says Haines. "There just isn't enough
investment in the tertiary sector. Some of the blame for fee
increases must lie with the institutions, but the real
problem lies in a short sighted economic plan with no
commitment to educating the future workforce."<p>

<p>Students
will be encouraged to bring details of their fees to the
University of Quad at 12pm. The student with the highest
fees will be invited to smash the ice sculptures with a
mallet.</p>

<p>Arena Williams, President of AUSA, says that stunt
will draw students' attention to the issue. "It's not just
about higher fees for students this year. Under investment
in education is something we should all be worried about,
because we're the generation who will be picking up the
pieces."</p>
