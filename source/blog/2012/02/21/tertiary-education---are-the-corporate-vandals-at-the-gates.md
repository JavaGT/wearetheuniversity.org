         Media release</p><p>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautu
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>21 February 2012</p><p><strong>Tertiary
education - are the corporate vandals at the
gates?</strong></p><p>World expert on tertiary education David Robinson will be visiting New
Zealand for the first time later this month and giving a
series of public lectures on increasing corporatisation and
privatisation of tertiary education around the world.</p><p>Dr
Robinson, who is a highly regarded, and sometimes satirical,
speaker from Canada, is the senior higher education
consultant to Education International, the global union for
teachers.</p><p>He will be giving three public lectures
at:</p><p><strong>Auckland, 27 February at the University of
Auckland</strong></p><p>•	Lecture Theatre 018, Level 0, the
Clocktower, 22 Princes Street</p><p>•	5.30pm - 7pm</p><p>•	What
are the international directions in tertiary education
policy? What do they mean for vocational training and higher
education?</p><p><strong>Christchurch, 28 February at the
University of Canterbury</strong></p><p>•	LAWS 108 Lecture
Theatre</p><p>•	6pm - 7pm, with drinks
beforehand</p><p>•	Lessons from Hurricane Katrina and other
disasters - what happens when natural disasters are being
used to radically reshape the tertiary education provision
in a city.</p><p><strong>Wellington, 1 March at Victoria
University</strong></p><p>•	GBLT1, Government House Law
School</p><p>•	6pm - 7pm, with drinks beforehand</p><p>•	The
paradox – in New Zealand successive governments say
tertiary education is one of the most important things in
which to invest. Yet the system itself and people who work
in it are under more pressure than ever before.</p><p>The
Tertiary Education Union Te Haut? Kahurangi o Aotearoa is
organising Mr Robinson’s
visit.</p><p><br>ENDS<br>
