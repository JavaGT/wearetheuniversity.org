<p>Media Release – 10 February 2012 – For Immediate
Use</p>

<p><br>Tertiary Education Minister positive about the
role of student associations.</p>

<p><br>Tertiary Education
Minister Steven Joyce addressed students’ association
presidents and executives at a conference of the National
Union of Students’ Associations held in Wellington
today.</p>

<p>Minister Joyce commented that “any institution
that doesn’t have a dialogue with students isn’t doing
its job right.”</p>

<p>The Minister was positive about the role
of student associations in discussions with their
institutions. He said it was important that students were
involved in the decision making process around student
services levy spending.</p>

<p><br>“In the VSM environment,
student associations fight to bring students concerns to the
table. It’s great to see the minister supports this,’’
says Logan Edgar, President of Otago University Students
Association.</p>

<p><br>Otago University Students Association has
a strong relationship with Otago University and hopes that
other Universities throughout New Zealand can also look to
the Otago model to build strong relationships with organised
students.</p>

<p><br>“I’m pleased that the government
recognizes that students pay for their student services and
should have some control over how those services are
delivered,” says Arena Williams, President of Auckland
University Students Association.</p>

<p><br>The Auckland
University Students Association is currently still in
negotiations about their student services agreement with the
University of Auckland.</p>

<p><br>President Williams says that,
“if the Minister thinks we should ‘keep our heads
down’ because there is no extra funding available for the
tertiary sector, then it is important that students have a
say in how our student services levies are spent. This will
ensure that they can be spent efficiently in a way that
improves the quality of tertiary
education.”</p>
