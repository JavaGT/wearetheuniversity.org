         <b>Ministry responds to funding cuts with
commercialisation</b></p><p>The Ministry of Education released
its briefing to the incoming minister to the
public last week. Or, at least parts of it that are not
being withheld under the Official Information Act were
released.</p><p>The ministry begins its briefing by noting that
total expenditure on tertiary education as a percentage of
gross domestic product (excluding student loans) fell from
2.0 percent in 2009/10 to 1.9 percent in 2010/11. Total
tertiary expenditure, excluding student loans, will fall by
a further 4.8 percent over the next five years.</p><p>The
admission that the government is actively and continuously
cutting tertiary education funding shapes many of the
recommendations the ministry makes. Its overarching approach
is to target increasingly limited funding on those areas and
students it believes will best match the government's
economic growth goals.</p><p>It also aggressively seeks external
private funding, both through export education, and by
greater links between tertiary education, research and
private companies.</p><p>TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey
says funding pressures are leading the ministry to abandon a
commitment to broad-based, equitable and accessible
education.</p><p>"The ministry's narrow focus on picking winners
for the economy and on generating private income to cover
its public funding shortfall undermines New Zealand's
historical commitment to open accessible public tertiary
education," said Dr Grey.</p><p>TEU general staff vice-president
Helen Kissell said, "The intention of the ministry to
interfere with the autonomy of tertiary institutions to
ensure they aren't teaching or researching in 'lower
priority' areas, as defined by government, is a fundamental
threat to academic
freedom."</p><p>ENDS
