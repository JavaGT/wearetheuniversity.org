         <strong></strong> <br>Media Release<br>Tertiary Education
Union<br>2 February 2012 <br><strong>Treasury wants
education for the few not the many</strong></p><p>TEU national
president Dr Sandra Grey says Treasury’s advice about
tertiary education is misplaced and simplistic.  </p><p>“There
is no evidence that shifting funding to favour younger
students getting degrees will have any impact on the economy
at all. In fact Treasury’s focus on degrees at the expense
of other qualifications will take away opportunities from
some New Zealand families who most need education to lift
themselves up and contribute to New Zealand’s
economy.”</p><p>Dr Grey was responding to Treasury’s advice to government
ministers, which was released today.</p><p>“Treasury
thinks it can pick winners and invest only in them. This
denies opportunities to all other ordinary New
Zealanders,” said Dr Grey. </p><p>Dr Grey says Treasury’s
desire to shift research funding to favour research that
private firms ask for is effectively an attempt to privatise
our public research institutions.</p><p>“We should not
research things only because a private firm thinks it can
make a profit. Often there is a crucial need for research
that is not solely in the interests of private
companies.</p><p>“If Treasury wants a vibrant growing economy
and communities, it needs to invest equitably in all types
of education and research,. “ said Dr
Grey.<br><strong></strong><br>
