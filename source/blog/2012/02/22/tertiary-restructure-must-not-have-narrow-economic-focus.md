<p><b>Tertiary education restructure must
not have narrow economic focus</b></p>

<p>Tertiary education is
not just about science and economic development, says TEU
national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>Ms Riggs’ comments
follow news that Steven Joyce, the minister of science,
tertiary education and economic development agencies, is
considering restructuring all three agencies at the same
time.</p>

<p>"Tertiary education is closely related to science as
an economic development, but it is also closely related to
health - people with tertiary education have better health
outcomes on average. Access to tertiary education helps
reduce crime. So, why not consider a merger between tertiary
education, the department of health and police instead?
Tertiary education links closely to agriculture, archives,
the arts council, and the list goes on."</p>

<p>"There are many
important economic and scientific benefits from a broad,
accessible, high quality tertiary education system. But
those are not the only benefits. The minister needs to make
sure that his focus on economic development and science does
not crowd out space for all the other important social and
community benefits that high quality public tertiary
education should provide," said Ms Riggs.</p>
