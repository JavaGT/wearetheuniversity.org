<p><b>Antagonistic minister inflamed
protestors</b></p>

<p>The University of Auckland Branch of the
Tertiary Education Union condemns the action of police,
which involved excessive use of force when faced with
peaceful student protest and the use of tactics known to
incite rioting. Police arrested 43 students after the
minister of finance Bill English told them ‘they need some
Greeks to show them how to do it’.</p>

<p>"We are offended by
the dismissive and antagonistic language of the Minister,"
said TEU branch president Paul Taillon.</p>

<p>On Friday
afternoon several hundred students gathered in protest
against the recent budget and comments from the Minister of
Finance that followed their previous protest. The event
involved police dividing the protestors into two groups and
'kettling' one group, from which 43 were arrested.</p>

<p>"We
support the cause of the students in fighting for quality
higher education that is widely available and designed for
the public good," said Taillon. "And we insist upon the
right to peaceful protest when democratic values are under
threat."</p>
