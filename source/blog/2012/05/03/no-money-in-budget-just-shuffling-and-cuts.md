         <b>No money in budget, just shuffling and cuts</b></p><p>The
prime minister, John Key, and the minister of tertiary
education skills and employment, Steven Joyce, this week
foreshadowed several tertiary education budget
initiatives.</p><p>Mr Joyce told Radio New Zealand that he would be
shifting funding away from humanities and commerce towards
maths, science, engineering and technology.</p><p>"We pay a
higher subsidy for humanities and commerce than the
Australians do, we pay a lower subsidy for science and
engineering."</p><p>"That tends to mean that universities are a
bit more biased towards those other subjects because we end
up paying, probably, a little bit more than they need to
encourage those subjects and not enough for the science,
technology and engineering subjects," Mr Joyce said.</p><p>His
statements follow a Tertiary Education Commission edict to
tertiary institutions to increase enrolments next year in
science, technology, engineering and maths and, if
necessary, to cut other courses to do that.</p><p>Meanwhile Mr
Key told business leaders it would be another zero budget, and, to help achieve that,
people with student loans, who currently pay back 10 cents
for each dollar they earn, will have to pay them back
faster. Then Mr Joyce said that the government would cut
allowance costs by ensuring allowances are targeted at those in the early years of
study and to those that can least afford it.</p><p>NZUSA
president Pete Hodkinson said that any cuts to allowances
would reduce access, denying New Zealanders an
opportunity to improve their lives, and would lead to
greater
debt.</p><p>ENDS
