<p><b>University of Canterbury closure angers indebted
student</b></p>

<p>A part time student at the University of
Canterbury says the university's plan to close its theatre
program will cost her $4000 of fees for a degree she can no
longer complete. Sarah has told the student campaign You are UC:</p>

<p>"If I was a single teen or
in my early 20s, I could move to Wellington, Auckland, or
Otago to complete my Theatre degree. But this is not my
situation. I am married, I have 3 children, I own a home in
Christchurch, moving to suit the degree I want to achieve is
not in the realm of possibility for me. The only reason I
started a degree at Canterbury was so I could become a High
School Drama teacher. If this closure goes ahead, I will
have spent $4000 towards a degree which I will be unable…
to complete at Canterbury University."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the
<i>Christchurch Press </i>reports that corporate culture at the university may be
choking creativity. Reporting on the change proposal to
close theatre and film studies <i>The Press</i>
notes:</p>

<p>"[T]he issue at the moment, the document goes on to
say, is not that Arts courses are weak or unsustainable, but
that the College of Arts offers more courses than it can
support on current and projected income."
</p>

<p>"In short: there
is nothing wrong with the affected courses but someone or
something has to go. It also becomes clear that this
thinking actually pre-dates the earthquakes, as the proposal
says [Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the College of Arts, Prof]
Adelson has been engaged in his strategic process for 18
months."</p>

<p><i>The Press </i>reports that that TEU has filed
papers with the Employment Authority seeking a compliance
order. Essentially, the filed papers charge the university
with not following its own rules around academic
process.</p>
