         <strong>University Council Reforms will Incur Unneeded
Cost</strong></p><p>Reforming university councils could lead to
the same sort of waste and bureaucracy that similar reforms
created in polytechnics, warns TEU national president Sandra
Grey.</p><p>When the government imposed business-style reform on
polytechnic councils two years ago, experienced,
democratically-chosen, community people were sacked from the
boards and replaced with expensive ministerially-appointed
bureaucrats. Unsurprisingly, costs went up and
accountability to communities diminished.</p><p>Dr Grey says the
changes to polytechnic councils were not only undemocratic,
they were costly.</p><p>At Wintec, for instance, fourteen people
sat on Wintec’s council before the reforms and collected
$93,000 in council fees. Then in 2010, the eight
councillors, appointed by either the Minister of Tertiary
Education or the council took pay rises of between 17 and
131 percent, and collected just under $109,000, despite
being half the size and less representative. At Unitec the
15 councillors in 2009 received a total of $99,000 (an
average of $6,600 each). The eight councillors in 2010
appointed by either the minister or the council itself, took
$116,000 (an average of $14,500 each).</p><p>NorthTec’s 2010
annual report shows that it spent over $500,000 more on
consultants and legal fees than it did in 2009 – up 195
percent from $286,000 to $844,000. Meanwhile the 2010
Whitireia annual report shows an increase in consultants and
legal fees of $52,000, up 18 percent on 2009.</p><p>"Why would
the government want to replace diverse, democratically
elected people who have a range of skills and a passion for
their local university, with a more expensive, less diverse
team of ministerially-appointed bureaucrats?" said Dr
Grey.</p><p>ENDS
