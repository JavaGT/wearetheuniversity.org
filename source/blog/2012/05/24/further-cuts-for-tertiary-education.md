<p><b>Further cuts for tertiary
education</b></p>

<p>Despite record numbers of students in
tertiary education this year the government has yet again
cut funding.</p>

<p>Since this government came to office, student
numbers have grown by 5,000 but government tertiary
education funding has fallen by $500 million. Today’s
Budget has cut funding even further.</p>

<p>TEU’s national
president Dr Sandra Grey says tertiary education can, if
well-funded, move people into new jobs to help New
Zealand’s economy recover.</p>

<p>“Investing in the future
rather than cutting corners is the only way for New Zealand
to overcome the global financial crisis,” said Dr Grey.
“We need to invest in learning and research to give New
Zealand’s economy a chance to recover.”</p>

<p>“Investing
strategically in public research and education is one of our
best tools for helping New Zealand climb above global
financial troubles,” said Dr Grey.</p>

<p>Overall tertiary
education expenditure for 2012 is forecast to be $60 million
less than 2011. Treasury forecasts that government funding
will remain below 2009 levels right through until
2016.</p>

<p>The trade-offs this government chooses to make are
hard to comprehend. Funding for adult and community
education suffers further cuts, as does funding for funding
for adult literacy and numeracy, but there are increased
subsidies for private companies that want to make a profit
from selling education. There is no overall investment in
lifting quality of education to international students or to
improve international competitiveness but money to spend on
advertising for international students
increases.</p>
