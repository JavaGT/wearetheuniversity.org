<p><b>Students protest 'black' budget</b></p>

<p><br>Students at
the universities of Auckland and Victoria are planning to
protest today's budget and impending to cuts to student
allowances.</p>

<p>The student action group 'We are the
University' at both universities are holding student
association and TEU endorsed protests.</p>

<p>At Auckland
University, over a thousand students have said that they
will attend a 'student strike' outside the library at
1.00pm.</p>

<p>At Victoria University of Wellington students are
planning to march to Parliament from their Kelburn campus at
12 noon.</p>

<p>We Are the University Auckland says the
government is planning to attack students with this year's
budget:</p>

<p>"It will affect current students, ex-students and
potential future students by limiting allowances to the
first four years of study or 200 weeks (with no exceptions
for longer degrees or postgrad study), by freezing the
parental income threshold to get the allowance (so even
fewer students can get it), and increasing the repayment
rate from 10 percent to 12 percent. We have had enough of
the short sighted, mindless politics of austerity that limit
who gets access to tertiary education and that see us paying
rent to a generation that had everything they are taking
from us."<p>

<p>TEU will have analysis and comment on Budget
2012, as well as links to coverage of tertiary
education-related and employment-related Budget news on its
website.</p>

<p><b>TEU rejects performance pay in
education</b></p>

<p>The government's announcement that it wants
to introduce performance pay into the education sector flies
in the face of research and good practice says TEU national
president Sandra Grey.<p>

<p>"Most of the credible evidence
shows that performance pay in any sector, but especially in
education, is demotivating. The main benefit for employers
is simply that, over time, it lowers the total amount they
need to spend on salaries or wages."</p>

<p>US motivation expert
Dan Pink recently noted that reward systems often backfire.
In fact, compensation based upon performance may actually
lead to worse academic results for students.</p>

<p>"The research
shows that money matters. It just matters in a slightly
different way than we suspect. Paying people unfairly —
say, when Jane makes less than June for the same work — is
extremely demotivating. And, of course, low salaries can
deter some people from pursuing certain professions.
Therefore, the best use of money as a motivator, at least
for complex work, is to compensate people fairly and to try
to take the issue of money off the table.  That means paying
healthy base salaries…"<p>

<p>Dr Grey said performance pay
for education would be a harmful idea for education in New
Zealand, including for academic, general/allied staff and
for students in tertiary education.<p>

<p>Management researcher
Alfie Kohn says performance pay makes employees feel that
they are being punished, it is manipulative, it ruptures
good workplace relations and it deters risk-taking. Mr Kohn
notes<br>"Not a single controlled study has shown a
long-term improvement in the quality of work as a result of
any reward system. That would be an astonishing fact were it
not for the existence of scores of studies – conducted
with adults as well as children, in real workplaces among
other venues – that have demonstrated how rewards tend to
be not merely ineffective but powerfully
counterproductive."</p>

<p><b>Good employment law crucial
to good vocational training</b><br>Teachers must be included
in governance and delivery decisions about vocational
education and training according to Education
International's special advisor David Robinson.<br>Dr
Robinson, who was speaking at a UNESCO International
Congress on vocational education and training in Shanghai
said Education International is increasingly concerned that
reforms are most often something done to teachers and
trainers, rather than with them.</p>

<p>"Particularly in the wake
of the financial crisis and the imposition of austerity
measures, we have seen a dangerous trend toward governments
and employers not negotiating with teachers across the
education sector," Robinson emphasised. "In some extreme
cases, we've even seen legislative denials of basic
negotiating and bargaining rights."</p>

<p>Ironically, Dr
Robinson's comments came on the same day New Zealand's
Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson announced a package of new
employment law measures that will allow employers to opt out
of concluding collective employment negotiations, to opt out
of multi-employer bargaining, and to opt out of offering new
employees the union negotiated employment conditions during
their first 30 days of employment.</p>

<p>"[Vocational education
and training] around the world faces a number of
challenges," Dr Robinson stated. "These challenges cannot be
effectively met without strong social dialogue
mechanisms."</p>

<p>The International Labour Organisation and
UNESCO define social dialogue in the education sector to
mean "all forms of information sharing, consultation, and
negotiation between educational authorities, public and
private, and teachers and their democratically elected
representatives in teachers' organisations."<br>For example,
Dr Robinson noted that one critical challenge is the need to
recruit and retain qualified teachers.</p>

<p>"Social dialogue
has a key role to play in ensuring that vocational education
and training teachers and trainers enjoy appropriate terms
and conditions of employment and career prospects," said Dr
Robinson. "In line with international labour standards,
collective bargaining is a basic right that is critical in
this regard. Collective bargaining between employers and
teachers' unions, while not always easy, shows that
negotiated solutions to difficult choices are necessary if
we are to be successful."</p>

<p><b>Time to reinvest
universities' million dollar surpluses back in
staff</b><br>Tertiary institutions are releasing their 2011
annual reports and, despite falling government funding, most
fared well financially.<p>

<p>TEU's national secretary Sharn
Riggs says this bodes well for collective agreement
negotiations, which start soon at seven of New Zealand's
eight universities.</p>

<p>Victoria University reported a $14.5
million surplus (4.3 percent of revenue). AUT had a $9
million surplus (3.1 percent of revenue). The University of
Auckland posted a $32 million surplus (3.5 percent of
revenue) and the University of Otago had surplus of s $26
million, (4.5 percent of revenue). All except the University
of Auckland are due to begin negotiations soon.</p>

<p>The
University of Canterbury reported an overall loss of $115m
(39 percent of revenue) once costs relating to the
earthquakes were accounted for. Lincoln, Waikato and Massey
have not published their annual reports yet.</p>

<p>AUT, Otago
and Victoria all reported surpluses that are higher than the
three percent target that the Tertiary Education Commission
requires them generate.<br>"University vice-chancellors
consistently say that New Zealand needs to invest it its
university employees, and that their pay and employment
conditions need to be internationally competitive," said Ms
Riggs. "Now that they are in a stronger financial position
than the government requires of them, they are in the ideal
position to invest in solving the problem they themselves
have identified and decried."</p>

<p><b>Insecure work
rife in Australian universities</b><br>The Australian
National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) is welcoming the
results of an independent inquiry into insecure work.</p>

<p>The
report, <i>Lives on Hold,</i> came out last week and was the
result of a nationwide six-month examination into insecure
employment, which now affects nearly forty per cent of the
Australian workforce.</p>

<p>Jeannie Rea, NTEU National President
said insecure and casual work was widespread within tertiary
education.</p>

<p>"As an academic, I have watched the gradual
casualisation of my profession over the last decade with
growing alarm."</p>

<p>"As many as 77,000 out of a total
university workforce of approximately 180,000 are now
casually employed. More than half the undergraduate teaching
in Australian universities is carried out by casual
academics employed by the teaching hour."</p>

<p>"As the report
makes clear, the key divide in our workforce is no longer
between blue-collar and white collar workers, but between
those who have secure work with full entitlements and those
on the 'periphery' of the workforce who are employed in
casual and contract positions."</p>

<p>Dr Rea says there are
adverse financial and physical impacts of casual employment
on the workers concerned.</p>

<p>"I constantly hear stories of
talented young academics that have left the sector due to
the financial and emotional stress involved. It's a major
waste of talent."</p>

<p>The full report from the Independent
Inquiry into Insecure Work, <i>Lives on hold: Unlocking the
potential of Australia's workforce</i>, is available
here.</p>
