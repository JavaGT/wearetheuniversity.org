<p><br><strong>Tertiary education's sub-zero
budget</strong></p>

<p>Last week's Budget delivered a slight
decrease in funding for tertiary education, down from $4
billion last year to $3.9 billion this year. Treasury
forecasts that funding will continue to remain below 2009
levels ($4.5 billion) through until at least 2016, while
student numbers will continue to remain higher than 2009
levels.</p>

<p><strong>Government
flies blind on workforce planning</strong></p>

<p>Last May the
government used the Budget to crack down on people
collecting huge loans to become pilots.  It restricted loans
for aviation students and capped provider fees at be capped
at $40,000 per student. It also prevented people from using
their student loans for solo flight hours.</p>

<p>By October last
year the government scrapped all those changes.</p>

<p><strong>Vocational
training savaged in Victoria, AU</strong></p>

<p>It was meant to
be the most significant shake-up to vocational education in
Victoria, Australia, in years: a new demand-driven system
where public TAFE institutes (the equivalent of
polytechnics) competed for funding with private providers,
and where almost anyone who wanted to "up-skill" would be
guaranteed a subsidised place.</p>

<p><strong>PBRF
changes employment practice</strong></p>

<p>TEU's branch
co-president at Otago University Dr Brent Lovelock says PBRF
is affecting the role of academic staff.</p>

<p>“PBRF means
that staff are now much busier in terms of doing research,
so whether they dedicate as much time to things like lecture
planning, I don’t know. And community service? Pfft,
it’s dropped off the edge somewhere!”</p>

higher education is often seen as a female-friendly
industry, with overall numbers of both female students and
academic staff outnumbering men. Yet women remain a minority
as senior academics. In 2009 only a quarter of appointments
to positions above the level of associate professor went to
women. So what happens to all those women toiling away as
tutors and lecturers and researchers when it comes time to
move up? Do they simply lose interest or does something else
get in the way? - The
