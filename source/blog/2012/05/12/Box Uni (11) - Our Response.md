After a lengthy discussion amongst ourselves, we explain our position

---

alright so I'm we had a thing about it
we really like the spec you've pointed
out reasonability as one underlying
vandalism like I think we all want to
work through this in a reasonable way
and and I guess what the dispute is
about is about what is reasonable for
our situation and end up in you guys it
seems reasonable that it seems
unreasonable that we've got our friends
and supporters from living here with
that but for us especially coming from
the bicultural country of New Zealand
with the my value of the know Natalia is
something that is really dear to my
heart of something I believe in at the
core of us believe and a big part of the
nations came together for movements for
things we believe in and we're standing
together without content with our shared
value from an Italian but for the points
of Italy and the groom is going to
we wanted to do since the fact that this
university is not just about the
students and people here today like the
wider community is what we can get back
and what and kids that was going out
kind of quickly lasagna and that's what
we're really concerned that this is what
we're about we want this university be a
positive and talk of society we want to
see a favor ass so what we would like to
see happen is for the catalyst to say
yet we have searched for students coming
from hazard that haven't would ever go
to the University pegar and being in the
university environment we want student
perspective or candy to happen we want
our voice we want to be a little bit
weird people ever changes and so one
thing that specifically having to feel
as if cats while I a department there's
demand for those courses we want them
and notices teachers for the going we
want those to be about 310 teachers
[Applause]
that life's work thus explain that's not
rare one movement where r 1 group
we have this is why we're here is not
you know probably these people aren't
certain moral either gonna be stream ppl
remember the children of their big Jesus
that's about the University other part
of a lot of music that's by the time
like the person that effectively really
is it reasonable a group of people were
united by the sheer desire to make it
universally a better place let's make
the education to people coming better
higher-quality more open-minded more
creative thinking as a reasonable for
the fingerboard not stand up ask for a
better University for the future
generations to have a nice peaceful camp
out on in mind
but that reasonable but all you can
understand
boys
but with the sea
another Publix about to say and everyone
here who is not actually parents in
student has a great one physically to
sit by they would still work on that the
student for that the one who do the same
two messages you know like we're here
here's a student and combat policy
report or students are clear and anyone
who starts record over and even
so many problems like that doesn't about
publicly since I solutions the finger
problems old Adam is not teaching
anymore problems John existence
there was a discussion that
but there's something
I ask how you consume
really fun
[Music]
[Laughter]
laissez just a second please
double so say we've got a no drink at
nerve no alcohol and no drugs policy as
well there's no one here working you
like a no no I'm drugs and we're taking
that very seriously
in terms of reasonableness
