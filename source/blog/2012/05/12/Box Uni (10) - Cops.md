Management call in the cops

---

it's not Percy so we're all spokespeople
now no leaders would actually like you
to leave as we said before going to
leave please
what's my score
but it seems to me from or more
discussion with the management
reasonable that is why the people who
are students to stay here but the people
are students want to leave
and I say that too
I'd like to at least you understand
you've got a democracy going here so
absolutely have a discussion amongst
ourselves and see if you can see that
that's a pretty reasonable request it's
not what you're going to consist of
consumed there you go with all the
carrboro idea but look all my size can
we have this kindergarten escape this
just doing reasonable I mean I know
you're trying to make stand about you
trying to make a stand so there's no one
really here to see it at night because
you know might be horses who but try and
do it in a way that's sweet
so I don't think of this too much heart
so we'll give you a few minutes to have
a head their discussion amongst
yourselves and then just let us know if
you think that you can play a part and
trying to be reasonable about it will
come back and see okay so we say it will
give you for tonight's their discussion
Utley come back and see what you think
thank you thank you
pitching
