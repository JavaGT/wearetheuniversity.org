feeling is mutual I felt anyway I had to
point out that you are in breach of
things to become a catcher you have been
asked to move from this part of the
University and you haven't move to
you're not entitled to be here so you
are in breach of 44 points of j1 also
I'm going to pause 4.2 game board in
terms of you I asked you to do something
and you've knowingly fail to comply and
so we will be considering what action we
take respect to those of you who are
students and so it turns whatever your
plants live here my viewers you leave if
you don't leave then be careful and make
sure they were giving you don't good
sack we will continue tomorrow but by
saying you are in breach of the student
conduct policy we have got skips we can
take care we'll review what we will do
right absolutely not in there the ridge
right back
have a nice evening
