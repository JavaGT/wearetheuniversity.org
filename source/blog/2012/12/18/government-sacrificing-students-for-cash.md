<p>Media Release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>18 December

<p><strong>Government sacrificing students for
cash</strong></p>

<p>Today's half-yearly economic and fiscal
update from Treasury paints a bleak picture for tertiary
education.</p>

<p>The key data is in the Core Crown Expenses Table 6.8 (Tertiary
Education). What it shows is the government spent nearly
$50 million less on tuition this year (a cut of 2 percent)
despite having the equivalent of 10,000 more full-time
students than it had last year.</p>

<p>Overall, tertiary funding
has fallen by three quarters of a billion dollars, or twenty
percent since this government's first budget in 2009. That
does not include adjustments for inflation. CPI has risen by
6.9 percent during the same period.<p>

<p>Treasury forecasts
equivalent full-time student numbers to remain close to
their record high right through until 2017. However, it also
forecasts government spending on tertiary education to
remain at least $400 million less than it was in 2009, for
the next five years. The government seems happy to spend
less on today's 13-year-olds than it spent on today's
22-year-olds.</p>

<p>Treasury forecasts the government will cut
spending to student allowances by over $150 million over the
next five years. This means that students will have to take
larger student loans to pay for their cost of living. So,
the only new tertiary education spending of any real value
is on student debt that the government hopes to claim back
off our future students.<p>

<p>The finance minister Bill English
says these figures show the government is on track:</p>

<p>"This
programme is helping New Zealanders and their families to
get ahead, encouraging personal responsibility and rewarding
people for hard work and enterprise."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the
government is currently spending about a quarter of a
billion per year more on unemployment than it was in 2009
because there are no jobs for people who want to work.
People who want skills and education to find a job will find
it harder and harder to get an allowance to study. That
seems like a pretty poorly considered economic policy,
eh?</p>
