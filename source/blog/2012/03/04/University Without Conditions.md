“The University Without Conditions is a free university.

By free, we mean free of conditions.  We recognise that education at other institutions is only open to those who are willing to live with debt, and our aim is to not be a burden on those studying with us.

We are a self-organising collective, without ties to Government or corporations.  We exist not to produce ‘degrees for jobs’, but to enable a human being to improve themselves and the society in which they exist.

Courses are open to all, and anyone can run a course.

We hold lectures, seminars, exhibitions and workshops at a variety of locations, including[Tangle Ball](https://web.archive.org/web/20130208031151/http://tangleball.org.nz/), a community workshop and art space near Karangahape Road, and at various public venues through the city, such as Myers Park, Albert Park and others.”
