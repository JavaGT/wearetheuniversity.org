         <strong>Naked students borrow to live</strong></p><p>Students at the University of Auckland will today be
begging for essentials, to protest the reality of borrowing
to live. A group of students, wearing only towels, will beg
to borrow clothing and belongings from other students in
exchange for IOUs.</p><p>Every year, tens of thousands of
students are forced to take on debt in order to study.
Currently, students owe over $12,000,000,000 worth of
student loan debt, steadily increasing since 2007. Many
graduates are left owing $30,000 by the end of their
studies. Studies show that such debt has led to considerable
hardship for students, forcing many to go overseas in search
of higher wages. For many students, student debt plays a
part in later life decisions, including whether or not to
have children.</p><p>“Students are currently the only
group in society who are required to borrow to live” said
Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University
Students’ Association. “The current Studylink allowance
is better than nothing, but the reality is that many
students who really need it are missing out.” </p><p>“What students need is adequate support while at
University, and meaningful jobs available at the conclusion
of study. Instead, we have seen a net decrease in
investment, as well as an alarming youth unemployment rate.
Given that the Ministers making these decisions received
their tertiary education at no cost, we don’t think it’s
too much to ask for.”</p><p>The last three years have
been difficult for students, with cuts to eligibility to
student support for permanent residents, lower-achieving
students and those aged over 55. Additionally, the
introduction of the Voluntary Student Membership regime has
placed students’ associations under severe financial
stress, struggling to cope with a dramatic rise in demands
on advocacy and welfare services.</p><p>Today’s protest
caps off a week of antics at the University of Auckland.
Earlier this week, students have simulated one billion
dollars of student debt, frozen ice sculptures to represent
freezing fees, and set up an impromptu foodbank on
University grounds.</p><p> </p><p>ENDS<br>
