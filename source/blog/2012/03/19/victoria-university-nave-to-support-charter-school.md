<p>Media release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>19 March
2012<br>Victoria University naïve to support charter
school</p>

<p>Public education institutions such as Victoria
University of Wellington’s Faculty of Education should not
be tendering to run a private charter school, say TEU
national president Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>The Herald reported
yesterday that Victoria University was one of only five
organisations so far to express an interest in running a
private charter school.</p>

<p>Dr Grey says Victoria’s
expression of interest to run a charter school raises
worrying questions about what direction the university has
for education.<p>

<p>“If it has innovative new ideas for
education, why is it not already teaching and promoting
those ideas in our existing public schools through research
and teacher education at its own Faculty of Education.”<p>

<p>“New Zealand has a high quality public education
system, from early childhood right through to adult and
tertiary education. One of its strengths is that everyone,
no matter where they come from, has the same opportunity to
high quality teaching and learning. In contrast, charter
schools, like many other private education providers, are
limited and divisive. They take the focus away from
improving education for all New Zealanders to focus instead
on rewarding private, for-profit companies. Victoria should
not involve itself in legitimising this attack on quality
public education,” said Dr
Grey.<p>
