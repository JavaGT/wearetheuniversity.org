         Media Release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>26 March
2012</p><p><strong>TEC must make universities come clean on PBRF
rort</strong></p><p>Allegations that Victoria University of
Wellington is putting people out of work to increase its own
research funding are the symptom of a widespread malaise in
NZ universities' approaches to research funding, says TEU
national president Dr Sandra Grey. Universities are gaming
the performance-based approach to research funding (PBRF),
which funds tertiary education institutions based on
individual staff research performance, research degree
completions and the level of external income received. 
</p><p>Victoria University's Dr Martin Lally has claimed that
the university has varied or sought to vary the employment
agreements of a number of staff who are not active
researchers, to ensure their temporary absence from the
university at the June 2012 PBRF census date, thereby
improving the university’s PBRF result.</p><p>These
allegations fit with similar stories TEU has heard from
staff working at universities in New Zealand, according to
Dr Sandra Grey. We have raised these concerns with the
commission over the past few years:</p><p>"We know of:</p><p>•
staff being persuaded to resign on the understanding they
will be rehired after the PBRF round is completed;</p><p>•
staff put on fixed term agreements to avoid them counting
for PBRF measurements;</p><p>• staff being offered shorter
fixed term agreements to avoid counting in PBRF
measurements; and</p><p>• potential staff not being employed
to avoid them counting towards PBRF scores."</p><p>"These cases
represent an outrageous breach of people's employment
rights, but also make a farce of the PBRF as a funding
mechanism," said Dr Grey.</p><p>"We believe that the Tertiary
Education Commission should establish a wider independent
investigation to ensure no universities are rorting public
funding in this
way."</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
