<p><b>An open letter to the Minister of Tertiary Education,
Skills and Employment</b></p>

<p>Cc: Dr Rod Carr, vice-chancellor
of the University of Canterbury</p>

<p>28 March 2012</p>

<p><b>Dear Mr
Joyce,</b></p>

<p>We write to you to deplore the proposed closure
of entire programmes and majors at the University of
Canterbury. We warned you last year that, without your
intervention and support, many staff at the university would
lose their jobs, and students would lose the opportunity to
study the courses that inspire them. </p>

<p>That travesty, of
course closures and job losses, is now imminent. However, we
believe it is not too late to act to save these programmes
and the opportunities for students in these majors.
Canterbury needs, now more than ever, a broad and diverse
tertiary education that provides opportunities for all its
potential students.</p>

<p>You have refused to meet with us since
we warned you of this. But the time has come now to listen.
We, as representatives of tertiary education staff from
across the country, call upon you to intervene and provide
the financial security the University of Canterbury needs to
get back on its feet.</p>

<p>We are ready to work with you to
make sure that people throughout the Canterbury region have
the opportunity to learn. </p>

<p><b>Yours
sincerely,</b></p>

<p>Sandra Grey,<br>TEU national
president</p>
