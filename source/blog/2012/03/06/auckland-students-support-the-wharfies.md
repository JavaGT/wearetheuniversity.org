<p><strong>Auckland students support the wharfies</strong></p>

<p>In a unanimous decision at an executive meeting tonight,
the Auckland University Students’ Association has voted to
support the Maritime Union of New Zealand in its dispute
with the Ports of Auckland. The move confirmed a motion from
the Student Forum, a meeting of the University of Auckland
student body at large.</p>

<p>“What we’re seeing at the
Ports of Auckland is a clear step towards the casualisation
of work in New Zealand,” said Ryan Abbot, Chair of the
Student Forum. “Students came to a forum in the Quad at
the University to voice their support for certainty in
employment and fair work conditions.”</p>

<p>Arena
Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’
Association, said that some students would be critical of a
pro-union stance, but that the executive had debated the
issue at length and come to a consensus.<p>

<p>“Today’s students will be entering the workforce
soon and deserve the fair working conditions that kiwis have
enjoyed for generations. This dispute could set the scene
for employment relations for the next ten years, and it’s
important that students discuss and get involved in the
issue,” she said.</p>

<p>Auckland University Students’
Association encourages students to attend the next Student
Forum in the University Quad at 1pm on Wednesday 7 March to
discuss the issue further. Association Executive members
will attend the Maritime Union rally on Saturday 10 March to
show their support for the wharfies.</p>
