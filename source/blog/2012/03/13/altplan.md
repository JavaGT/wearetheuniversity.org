# Alternative Strategic Plan 

### Background

The 2013-2020 Strategic Plan is currently in development. The initial draft has now been drawn up, approved by Council, and released for “an extended period of discussion and consultation”. It will be returned to Council, finalised, and adopted by August.

This process will produce one type of plan; we aim to produce another. We believe that the university is a community, not an enterprise. We therefore feel that planning should start with those who care most deeply about this institution, rather than those granted influence via the position of authority that they occupy. We have seen, time and again, decisions made in this university that do not represent the interests of its staff and students. This is a trend that appears to be worsening, despite the management’s attempts to assure us of their best intentions. The current ‘vision’ of this university is not the vision of many of us.

The alternative plan is a means of moving from these criticisms to articulate, collectively, the principles that underlie them and the type of university that we _do_ envisage. It aims to inform others, but just as much ourselves, of what we believe to be the true meaning and role of this university.

### Call for contributions

In developing this plan, a working group of staff and students is calling for contributions, from students, staff of any kind, or interested others. The following questions provide a guide, although contributions should not be limited by them. Answer one, all, or make up others:

- What is a university?
- What is special about the University of Auckland?
- What would make people outside the university care more about it?
- What kind of university do we want the University of Auckland to be in 2020?
- How can we make this happen?

Contributions should be submitted by 30<sup>th</sup> April. They can be sent via email – [alternativestrategicplan@gmail.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20120313201715/mailto:alternativestrategicplan@gmail.com) - or submitted below. Enter your name (or ‘anonymous’ if you would like to remain so) and click ‘Next’ to access the question boxes:
