<p><br>Tertiary Education Union<br>13 March
2012<br><strong>Publishing graduate incomes is bureaucratic
beancounting.</strong></p>

<p>"The minister of tertiary
education, Steven Joyce’s desire to measure and count
meaningless data is flooding tertiary education with
unnecessary bureaucracy," says TEU national president Dr
Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Dr Grey’s comments follow news that the
minister wants to publish the average income of graduates
from specific courses as part of a push to get more out of
the tertiary sector.</p>

<p>"This is not helpful data for
graduates, and it is a ridiculous criterion against which to
measure courses and tertiary institutions."</p>

<p>"We know
already that people studying medicine earn more, on average,
than people studying humanities or trades. Everybody knows
that occupations with large numbers of female graduates earn
less on average than occupations with large numbers of male
graduates. And we know the biggest determinant of
someone’s income is how much his or her parents earned. We
have no need for data to be published on this."</p>

<p>"If the
minister really wants to collect this data and make good use
of it, he should be sending it on to the Department of
Labour and employers, pressuring them to do something about
those areas where the wages and salaries of qualified and
skilled New Zealanders are too low," said Dr
Grey</p>
