         Media Release – 29 March 2012 – </p><p><b> Students:
Minister’s Decision Hurting the
Vulnerable</b></p><p>University of Auckland students are up in
arms about a move that will see 1500 students lose weekly
payments that enable them to study. Tertiary Education
Minister Stephen Joyce has announced that unlike previous
years, there will be no adjustment to the parental income
threshold for student allowances.</p><p>Many students rely
on student allowances in order to be able to afford costs of
study, accommodation and living. The current system already
makes it difficult for most students to access allowances.
The assumption that all students under 24 are supported by
their parents is simply incorrect.</p><p>"It's simple. Clever,
able young people won't be able to study after secondary
school because they can't afford to," said Arena Williams,
Auckland University Students' Association
President.</p><p>“With high rent prices, increases in
course-related costs and high youth unemployment, students
are struggling to afford basic essentials such as doctors’
bills and travel costs. Even a small reduction in student
allowance funding has the potential to see students dropping
out of study altogether." </p><p>“We regularly assist
students living on $208 per week from the student allowance,
paying $150 a week in rent, $40 in food and $15 in travel.
As soon as this payment is reduced or eliminated, there is
no way students can make ends meet,” said Auckland
University Students' Association Welfare Officer, Kelsey
Carter.

<p>The Minister’s announcement, despite being
labelled a “first step”, follows a number of cuts to
student support. These include limiting access to permanent
residents, long-term students, older students and solo
parents. Students are becoming increasing concerned as to
what will be cut next.</p><p>The Auckland University
Students' Association believes that limiting access to
tertiary education rights is not something which will
benefit New Zealand in the long term. An inequitable and
uneducated society can never hope to achieve the targets for
economic growth set out by the current
government.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
