<p><strong>15% Of Students In Financial
Distress</strong></p>

<p>University of Auckland students return
to study this week after a two week recess, and with winter
approaching some students are very happy to be back.<p>

<p>"Studying in my flat is freezing already. After a few
hours your feet and hands get numb," said University of
Auckland student Alisha, 22. "I'm looking forward to being
back on campus where it's warm."<p>

<p>Findings of the Baseline
Report of the Graduate Longitudinal Study New Zealand
(GLSNZ) show that around 15% of students suffer from
absolute financial distress and aren't able to afford basic
accommodation, food and clothing requirements.<p>

<p>The
results of the GLSNZ were released this month. It sampled
nearly 9,000 students in their final year across the eight
New Zealand universities between July and December 2011. It
will follow these graduates over the next ten years.</p>

<p>“We
know there are students in severe financial hardship. The
numbers of food parcels and emergency hardship grants
we’ve been giving out have only increased in the last two
years,” said Arena Williams, President of the Auckland
University Students’ Association.<p>

<p>“However, when
almost 1 in 6 students are in severe financial distress, we
have to start asking questions about whether the Government
is fulfilling its role to ensure that everyone with the
potential to succeed in tertiary education has a fair
chance,” said Ms Williams.</p>

<p>The Auckland University
Students’ Association calls for improvements to the
student living allowance scheme. The maximum entitlement per
week for a student under 24, without children, living away
from home is $170.80. This should be adjusted to reflect the
true cost of living in University centres.<p>
<p>“New
Zealander’s can’t stand for a tertiary education system
that allows only those with parental support to succeed and
complete their qualifications. If you haven’t grown up in
a home where a University education is ordinary, you’re
very unlikely to work for years to support yourself and then
come back to study,” said Ms Williams.</p>

<p>The Auckland
University Students’ Association will be demonstrating
student financial distress in the University Quad today.
Students will be asked to undertake extreme challenges such
as mass lube wrestling, eating pigs eyes and lambs brains,
setting themselves on fire and public nudity. Any students
desperate enough to attempt the challenges will receive much
needed cash.</p>

<p><br>Students at the University of Auckland
will be gathering in the Quad for the extreme challenges at
12pm, starting at
12.15.</p>
