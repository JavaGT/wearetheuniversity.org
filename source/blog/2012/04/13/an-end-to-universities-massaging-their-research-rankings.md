<p><strong>An End To Universities Massaging Their
Research Rankings</strong></p>

<p>TEU members welcome the
Tertiary Education Commission’s attempt to end gaming of
research funding.</p>

<p>"Universities have tried to change their
research rankings compared to other universities by 'hiding'
staff they consider will compare poorly in terms of research
output," said TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey.
"Universities have changed people's employment agreements,
restructured departments and people's jobs and in some cases
made academics redundant simply so that they can appear
higher on a rankings ladder than other
universities."</p>

<p>Today the commission released the initial audit of the performance based
research fund exercise carried out by KPMG. The audit
shows a range of issues with the way institutions are
engaging the exercise, confirming that gaming has been
occurring in the research funding exercise.</p>

<p>"The
Commission is now consulting on ways to end the gaming of
the system, though this attention to the process has come
too late for staff that have lost their jobs in institutions
wanting to manipulate their quality ranking."</p>

<p>"TEU has
consistently and publicly lobbied the commission about this
issue for a long time and we are glad to see that our
concerns have been recognised," said Dr Grey. "I hope that
this review and consultation on performance based research
funding will mean that good teachers and emerging
researchers at universities can have more job
security."</p>
