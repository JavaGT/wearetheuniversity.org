<p>Media Release – 4 April 2012 – For Immediate Use</p>

<p><br>Students call to vote no confidence in the editor of
Craccum</p>

<p>Students at the University of Auckland have called
for a Special General Meeting to move a motion of no
confidence in the editor of the student magazine,
Craccum.</p>

<p>Craccum has been published since 1914.  It has
had a number of high profile editors, including former
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jonathan Hunt, the
Right Honourable Sir Owen Woodhouse, Martin "Bomber"
Bradbury and Tim Shadbolt. Students last exercised their
right to remove the editor in 1989.</p>

<p>20 students petitioned
the Auckland University Students' Association to hold the
Special General Meeting, in line with the Association's
constitution. The students claim that the magazine is not
representative, and is overtly political.</p>

<p>"The Auckland
University Students' Association has a proud history of
electing the editor of the student magazine," says Arena
Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’
Association. "It's a democratic platform for expression of
students' views, and if students are unhappy about how it
has been run this year, they're entitled to have their say
at a Special General Meeting."</p>

<p>"The Students' Association
does not support or oppose the students' motion of no
confidence in the editor. We have called the meeting because
we think it's important that students views are
represented," she said.</p>

<p>The SGM will be held on Thursday
19 April in the University Quad. All students may attend,
but only members of the Auckland University Students'
Association are entitled to vote. Quorum for the meeting is
200 and the vote of no confidence requires a simple majority
to
pass.</p>
