<p>Media Release – 26 April 2012<p>

<p><b>Vote By Students
To Remove Craccum Editor Fails </b></p>

<p>Students at the
University of Auckland attended a Special General Meeting to
consider the motion of no confidence in the editor of the
student magazine, Craccum.<p>

<p>The motion failed affirming
support from the student body for Thomas Dykes to remain as
Editor of Craccum 2012. Final count of the vote was 144
against the motion to 83 for the motion with 10
abstentions<br>.  <br>After one hour of robust debate,
voting was taken by a division where those for and against
the motion stood at separate sides of the AUSA Quad.<p>

<p>"The
discussion at the SGM was good, with plenty of time to hear
views from all sides," says Arena Williams, President of the
Auckland University Students’ Association.</p>

<p>“There is
nothing radical about a radical student magazine,” said
Thomas Dykes, Craccum Editor urging students at the SGM to
contribute a broader range of content. “I’m not going to
write your right wing articles for you. You write them,
I’ll publish them.”<p>

<p>The SGM ended on a hopeful note
with a handshake between Thomas Dykes, Craccum Editor and
Kirk Jacinto, the student behind the SGM.<p>
