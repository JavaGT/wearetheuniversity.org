<p><b>Tertiary education vital tool in
economic recovery</b></p>

<p>New data from the OECD shows that
countries that invested in tertiary education weathered the
global financial crisis better than those that did
not.</p>

<p>TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey says the data
is yet another signal to the minister of tertiary education
that he needs to change his approach.</p>

<p>"It's pretty
self-evident that investing in tertiary education helps
protect people and countries from economic troubles. It is a
shame our current government has chosen to systematically
cut hundreds of millions of dollars from tertiary education
since 2009."</p>

<p>"New Zealand has great tertiary education
institutions, great students and great teachers. With a
little more belief and support from government we could lead
New Zealand's recovery from the economic downturn. Instead,
because of savage government cuts we are also mired in our
own internal downturn," said Dr Grey.</p>
