	 <p>
         19 January 2012</p><p><b>Students the losers as University of
Auckland cuts Health Services funding</b></p><p>Students have
been hit with a new $12 fee for GP consultations at the
University of Auckland Health Service, which used to be
free.</p><p>Up until December 2011 healthcare at the University
was funded by the Student Services Levy. Full time domestic
and international students pay a levy of $689, which has not
decreased in line with the changes to the Health Services
funding model.</p><p>“The Health Services provide a basic
level of healthcare for students who can’t afford to
access other providers,” says Arena Williams, President of
the Auckland University Students’ Association.</p><p>“There
may be some students who can afford to pay the new fee, but
University Health Services played a special role in
delivering free care to those most in need.”</p><p>Funding
cuts for vital services are expected to continue as
universities around the country struggle with broader cuts
to the tertiary sector. “However, passing rising costs on
to students without considering the impact on student
welfare is not the answer.” says Williams.</p><p>“The
service is a central part of University life. It is the
first port of call for very sick students who cannot sit
exams, and is the only primary health provider nearby which
offers a specialised service for young people,” says
Williams.</p><p>“We are opposed to the new fee, but we accept
that a shift in the University’s attitude to universal
service provision may be inevitable. In that case, we would
expect that students would see a decrease in their Student
Service Levy payment.”</p><p>The Auckland University
Students’ Association will continue talks with the
University department in charge of service provision before
students return for semester
one.</p><p>ENDS
