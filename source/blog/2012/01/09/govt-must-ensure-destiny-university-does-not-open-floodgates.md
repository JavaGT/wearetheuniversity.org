         Media Release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>9 January
2012</p><p><strong>Govt must ensure Destiny University does not
open floodgates</strong></p><p>Destiny Church ‘University’
could be just the beginning if the government’s
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) trade negotiations conclude
without proper public scrutiny.</p><p>“Destiny’s outlandish
‘university’ makes a mockery of the public education
responsibilities of New Zealand’s real universities,
polytechnics and wānanga,” said TEU President Dr Sandra
Grey. “Our public universities all provide accredited
evidence based high quality public education. That is what
New Zealanders expect when they hear the term
‘university’.”</p><p>“In all likelihood Mr Tamaki’s
‘university’ will do none of those things. It is likely
that his own battered reputation will be enough to ensure
most Kiwis are not conned into paying for an education of
little value. However, there are thousands of other
pseudo-educational institutions like Mr Tamaki’s out there
in the world, many wanting to expand their market access
into New Zealand.”</p><p>“The Government’s Trans-Pacific
Partnership Agreement, currently being negotiated with the
United States and seven other countries, will ensure those
sham-universities have the same rights to set up business in
New Zealand that Mr Tamaki has. In effect, the combination
of proposals like Mr Tamaki’s and the TPPA threatens to
open the floodgates for dozens of foreign privately-owned,
extremist sham-universities to set up a campus in New
Zealand and seek public
funding.”</p><p>ENDS<br>
