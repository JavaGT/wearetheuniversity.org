         <br>Tertiary Education Union<br>Media release<br>9 November
2012</p><p><strong>Waikato Scholar Wins Academic Freedom
Award</strong></p><p>TEU will hold its inaugural Awards of
Excellence ceremony next week. Among the recipients will be
Professor Martin Thrupp from the University of Waikato, who
will win an award for his defence of academic freedom.</p><p>Academic freedom is the crucial right of
scholars to teach, research and speak up about ideas or
facts (including those that are inconvenient to external
political groups or to authorities) without fear of
reprisal, censorship or discipline.</p><p>TEU will honour Martin
Thrupp for speaking out against national standards being
introduced into New Zealand schools. In 2011 Professor
Martin Thrupp had to defend his own right to research and
speak out on a matter of public concern. Having criticised
the government’s flagship school policy of National
Standards, Martin found his research and university teaching
under attack by the then minister of
education Anne Tolley, print media and right-wing bloggers.
Undeterred, Professor Trupp has continued to build a
well-respected research programme on the National Standards.
He has also continued his academic activism as a public
speaker and in the media, and has provided academic
leadership speaking out publicly, but always exercising his
academic freedom in a responsible manner – using sound
research evidence and argument.

<p>TEU national president
Sandra Grey says the new awards recognise the intrinsic
values that make tertiary education a public good that
benefits all New Zealanders.</p><p>"At the moment government
policy values tertiary education’s economic outputs and
labour market productivity. We wanted to take the time to
recognise some of the less tangible but equally crucial
things tertiary education and tertiary educators give to New
Zealand. These awards recognise people who have shown
excellence in student learning and participation,
professional integrity, academic freedom and supporting
research and learning," said Sandra Grey.<br><strong>Award
