         <br>Tertiary Education Union<br>30 November
2012</p><p></p><p>Funding experiment leads to education providers
with no teaching materials</p><p>It seems that the Tertiary
Education Commission has, in its haste to implement the
minister’s level one and two contestable funding
experiment, made rushed assessments of several private
training providers’ preparedness to teach courses early
next year.</p><p>The Chief Executive of Manukau Institute of
Technology (MIT), Dr Peter Brothers, said yesterday his
institution has been approached by some private training
providers who are looking to buy curriculum and teaching
materials because they bid for courses that they have not
been previously teaching.</p><p>Those private training providers
won the right to teach courses after the government rushed
through a decision to change the way it funds level one and
two foundation studies courses.</p><p>As a result, the
Commission took millions of dollars of money from
established local polytechnics courses and gave it to
private providers and other providers.</p><p>TEU had heard
rumours that several of those providers had no course
materials, no teachers and no space to provide the courses
for which they successfully bid. Dr Brothers comments appear
to confirm those rumours.</p><p>"It seems the minister’s hasty
decision to implement this funding experiment at short
notice has led the Tertiary Education Commission to take
money off well-established, publicly-owned polytechnics and
award it, in some cases, to private providers with limited
experience of these programmes, no classrooms and no
materials," said TEU National President Sandra
Grey.</p><p>ends
