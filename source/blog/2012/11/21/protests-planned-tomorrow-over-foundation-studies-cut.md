         <br>Media Release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>21 November
2012</p><p><strong>Protests Planned Tomorrow Over Foundation
Studies Cut</strong><br><strong></strong><br>TEU will be
holding protests and meetings at polytechnics around the
country tomorrow to convince the government to put more
money into foundation studies education at polytechnics.</p><p>A
government change to the way it funds foundation studies
education has seen the funding for public polytechnics cut from
$38 million this year to only $6 million next year. As a
result, thousands of students have lost places at
polytechnics, dozens of courses are threatened with closure
and dozens of respected and qualified tutors stand to lose
their jobs.</p><p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says the
funding change is an ideological experiment by the minister
for tertiary education that has gone horribly
wrong.</p><p>“Public money should go to local public
institutions that were built by, belong to and are committed
to their communities.”</p><p>“We understand the Tertiary
Education Commission is meeting tomorrow to consider funding
allocations. We will be protesting and meeting publicly to
let it know that the government cannot abandon our
foundation studies students, our local regions and their
long-standing polytechnics. It needs to put money back into
polytechnics.”</p><p><strong>TEU events planned so far at 14
different campuses
include:</strong><br><strong></strong><br>•	WITT TEU is
leafleting the community in New Plymouth at
lunchtime<br>•	EIT TEU Taradale and Tairawhiti campuses
are holding lunchtime BBQs and handing out information to
the public<br>•	Waiariki TEU is doing a mobile message
board about the importance of public education to send to
the local National MP<br>•	MIT TEU is going to cut a cake
and hold a protest on the main road outside the institution
at 2pm (the cake shows a bigger slice of funding going to
private providers than polytechnics)<br>•	NMIT TEU is
going to have a lunchtime event and have a polystyrene
headstone to signal the death of Level 1 and 2
funding<br>•	UCOL TEU Whanganui and Palmerston North are
holding lunchtime protests<br>•	Otago Polytechnic TEU is
holding a lunchtime event<br>•	Unitec TEU is also going to
cut a cake and then head out leafleting<br>•	Northtec TEU
will be holding activities for members to share information
about why Level 1 and 2 funding is so
important<br>•	Weltec TEU will be leafleting and cutting a
cake at 12noon<br>•	The Open Polytechnic will be doing the
same at
10.00am</p><p>ENDS<br>
