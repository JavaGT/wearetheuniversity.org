         Tertiary Education Union<br>19 November
2012</p><p><br>Minister’s directive to Auckland VC is attack
on academic freedom</p><p><br>Steven Joyce’s threat to cut the
University of Auckland’s funding unless it teaches what he
wants is a direct attack on academic freedom, says TEU
national president Sandra Grey.</p><p>"The Minister is trampling
over the University of Auckland’s institutional autonomy
and over academic freedom, as legislated for in the
Education Act."</p><p>Dr Grey says it is naïve to think the
government should have no say in what universities do, but
that should not come at the expense of their independent and
democratic autonomy.</p><p>"Universities have institutional
autonomy in order to ensure that these institutions are able
to critique governments, politicians, and ministers, as well
as others who hold power in New Zealand. Without
institutional autonomy, and with threats such as the
Minister has made that 'I'm watching them [University of
Auckland] really closely', our universities risk becoming
puppets of the
state."</p><p>ends
