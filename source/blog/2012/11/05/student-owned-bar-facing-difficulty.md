         <strong>Auckland University Students’
Association</strong><br>For immediate
release.<br><strong>AUSA Media Release: November 5
2012</strong><br><strong><br>Student-owned bar facing
difficulty</strong></p><p>“Shadows Bar” at the University of
Auckland is entering a difficult period as its holding
company, Bacchid Benevolency Ltd (BBL), has a liquidator
appointed. BBL. The Auckland University Students’
Association (AUSA) is an indirect beneficiary of
BBL.</p><p>“AUSA and BBL have been under intense financial
pressure since AUSA became a voluntary association in
1999,” said AUSA President, Arena Williams. “Since then,
AUSA has not been able to independently sustain many of its
services, including Shadows. Unfortunately, BBL has not been
able to adapt to this new environment. AUSA has had to
support BBL to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars
in previous years. The student and independent trustees of
the Services Trust that oversees BBL was not satisfied that
it would be able to able to turn around its performance
without putting more student money at significant
risk.”</p><p>BBL also includes other outlets on campus, such
as the Quad and Hangar Cafes. But AUSA has made it clear
that its chief priority is Shadows, a popular student bar.
Under an agreement recently signed with the University, the
space that Shadows occupies will remain in student hands.
“We will be doing everything we can to make sure there is
a student bar on campus,” said Services Trust trustee and
AUSA Treasurer Bowen Liu. “We are currently taking advice
and are confident that there will be a bar operating by
Orientation Week 2013.</p><p>Students with further questions are
encouraged to contact Arena Williams at
