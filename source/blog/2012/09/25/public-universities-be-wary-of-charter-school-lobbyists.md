<p><strong>Public Universities Should Be Wary Of Charter
School Lobbyists</strong></p>

<p>New Zealand’s public
universities are letting big business and overseas political
lobbyists dupe them into endorsing bad education policy,
says TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>The universities
of Victoria, Auckland and Canterbury are all holding public
meetings this week where USA charter schools proponent Mike
Feinberg will get a platform to argue his case for charter
schools.  His trip is funded by the New Zealand Initiative
(a recent merger of right-wing lobby groups the Business
Round Table and the New Zealand Institute) and the Aotearoa
Foundation, which is a New Zealand offshoot of a religious
US philanthropy organisation that gives money to
organisations that ‘promote reform of public
education’.</p>

<p>“Universities are places of free speech
and we welcome Mike Feinberg sharing his views," said Sharn
Riggs. “However, those same universities also need to
weigh their duty as critic and conscience of society. They
should not allow lobby groups with political objectives that
have been widely discounted by the majority of New
Zealand’s education academics to trade on the reputation
of our public universities.”</p>

<p>“We would like to see
these three universities making it clear that Mr.
Feinberg’s views are those of political lobbying
organisations, not New Zealand universities’ schools and
faculties of education. He does not deserve credibility from
our public education system, which he has not yet
earned.”</p>
