<p>Media release<br>11 February 2015<br>Tertiary Education
Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p>

<p><strong>Govt cuts
staff and students from university councils
</strong></p>

<p>Parliament voted last night to remove the legal
right of staff and students to have democratically elected
representatives on their governing university and wānanga
councils.<p>

<p>Government MPs passed the Education Amendment
Bill, which has been opposed by an overwhelming number of
public submitters, including vice-chancellors, staff and
students.</p>

<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says the
union is now turning directly to the leaders of universities
and wānanga to make sure their councils retain a space for
independent staff and student representatives.</p>

<p>“We will
be campaigning at with each local university and wānanga
community for their council to set aside one-third of
council seats for democratically elected staff and student
representatives.”</p>

<p>“The government never gave a
justification for removing the legislated right for staff
and students to have democratically elected representatives
on councils or for diminishing the size of councils.”</p>

<p>We
know that despite the government's efforts to put councils
in the hands of ministerial appointees and business
executives, universities and wānanga still want their staff
and students to have a voice on their
councils.”</p>
