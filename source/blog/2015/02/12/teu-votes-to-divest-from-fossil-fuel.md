<p>TEU votes to divest from fossil fuel</p>

<p><br>Divest from any
companies that profit from fossil fuel extraction. That was
the message yesterday from Tertiary Education Union
representatives from around New Zealand to their union’s
governing council.</p>

<p> TEU’s council will meet next week to
vote on whether to adopt a fossil fuel divestment policy it
has drafted with the support of 350 Aotearoa. But yesterday union
representatives from nearly all New Zealand’s
universities, polytechnics and wānanga supported the
divestment policy.</p>

<p>“Climate change poses an
unprecedented and unequivocal threat to our future,”
saidJulie Douglas, a Senior Lecturer at
AUT’s Management Department.</p>

<p>“If we are to avoid
catastrophic climate change, we have to leave most of the
world’s fossil fuel in the ground. We cannot ruin our
chance of minimising and mitigating climate change by
exploring for and digging up more coal and gas,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow is Global Divestment Day and our union
plans to heed the call by continuing not to invest in any
fossil fuel companies,” said Wayne Linklater, Director of Victoria
University’s Centre for Biodiversity and Restoration
Ecology.</p>

<p>“More importantly, we’re also calling on New
Zealand’s tertiary education institutions to follow
Victoria University of Wellington’s lead, and divest from
companies that profit from fossil
fuels.”</p>
