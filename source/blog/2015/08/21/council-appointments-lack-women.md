         21 August 2015<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p><strong>Council appointments lack
women</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p><br>The tertiary
education minister is not appointing enough women to the
governing boards of universities and polytechnics.</p><p>The
minister announced yesterday that 12 of 15 reappointments to tertiary
education councils are men.</p><p>TEU women's vice-president
Cat Pausé says if the minister continues to reappoint
mostly men to tertiary education boards, not only will the
government never achieve its own limited targets for gender
balance, it will never redress the imbalance that already
exists.</p><p>"The minister's view of what makes a good council
member is too narrow. Councils are missing out on the
talents, diversity and perspective that women offer.
Councils are also missing out on people with a range of
diverse backgrounds and skills."</p><p>The fifteen
reappointments included two chief financial officers, four
company directors, four chief executives and four corporate
or commercial lawyers. Only one appointee has any experience
working in a public tertiary education institution.</p><p>Pausé
says tertiary education councils that support their local
communities, staff, students and alumni to elect council
members are more diverse and representative than councils
that appoint. There is evidence to suggest that diversity
leads to better financial performance and improved decision-making.</p><p>"Too often
people in power appoint people like themselves. They
perpetuate the imbalance because they do not accord enough
value to people who have different experiences and
backgrounds to their
own."</p><p><br>ends
