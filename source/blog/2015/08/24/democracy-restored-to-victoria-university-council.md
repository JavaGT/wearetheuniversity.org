<p><br>Democracy restored to Victoria University
Council</p>

<p><br>A strong campaign by staff and students has
won back democratically elected seats on Victoria
University’s governing council.</p>

<p>The council announced
today that there will be two seats under its newly
restructured model for students, and two for current
academic staff. All four of those council positions will be
elected.</p>

<p>TEU branch co-president Wayne Linklater says the
decision is a victory for democracy at the university. Under
the university’s initial proposal, staff and students
would have been appointed rather than elected to
council.</p>

<p>Linklater says that hundreds of staff and
students told the council that appointing rather than
electing would be undemocratic.</p>

<p>“We had petitions,
submissions and many people speaking face-to-face with
council members, arguing for the right to vote for our
representatives.”</p>

<p>TEU wanted general staff as well as
academic staff to have the opportunity to stand for a seat
on council, however this proposal only allows academic staff
to stand.</p>

<p>“It is unsatisfactory that general staff have
been disenfranchised,” says TEU’s other branch
co-president Frances Matheson.</p>

<p>General staff will get to
vote on the academic staff members to council, and some may
get the opportunity to stand for alumni positions on
council, but they will not be allowed to stand in their own
right.</p>

<p>Matheson say the final proposal is much better than
the initial proposal because it allows for elections.  It
also ensures good representation of women and Māori on
council.</p>

<p>“We can work with the current model for now,
but we will continue to campaign for us general staff to
have the right to stand for a council seat alongside our
academic
colleagues.”</p>
