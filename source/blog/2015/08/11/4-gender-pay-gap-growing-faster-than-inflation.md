<p><strong>$4 gender pay gap growing faster than
inflation</strong></p>

<p>The gap between the hourly pay rates of
men and women grew by another 30 cents last year.</p>

<p>The pay
gap is now $4.20 and it grew 7 percent in the last year,
according to the latest Quarterly Employment Survey
data.</p>

<p>"The government is not only ignoring the pay
gap." says TEU women's vice-president Cat Pausé, "it is
making it worse."</p>

<p>Far more women work in the public
sector, so by using the State Services Commission to
suppress public sector pay the government is also
suppressing the pay of many women workers.</p>

<p>The latest
Labour Cost Index data shows the public sector pay is
lagging behind private sector pay. Pay for people working in
the public sector rose by 1.2 percent last year whereas pay
for people working in the private sector rose 1.8
percent.</p>

<p>Pausé says four dollars is a huge pay gap, and
it is even more for Pasifika and Māori women.</p>

<p>"The pay
gap between men and women is growing faster than inflation.
The government needs to pay its own women fairly."</p>

<p>"But it
also needs to take proactive steps to close the gap for all
women - reintroduce pay and employment equity reviews, and
the pay and employment equity unit," says Pausé.</p>

<p>"Without
government actions we have gone backwards
quickly."</p>
