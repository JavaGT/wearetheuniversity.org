<p><strong>Lincoln needs academic not
executioner</strong></p>

<p>Lincoln University’s advert for a new vice-chancellor calls
for ‘superior execution skills’ but no mention at all of
academic knowledge.</p>

<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey
says Lincoln’s hunt for a vice-chancellor highlights just
how removed some of our tertiary institutions have become
from their core task of education.</p>

<p>"Last year <i>the Press</i> dubbed former
vice-chancellor Andy West the smiling assassin.
Nevertheless, it seems astonishing that the university is
following that appointment up by advertising for business
execution skills rather than someone who has a background
teaching and researching in a university," says Grey.</p>

<p>The
advertisement talks about someone with excellent partnering
skills.</p>

<p>"Lincoln wants this Casanova to enter multiple
relationships with industry, but it makes no mention of
collegial relationships with staff and students," says
Grey.</p>

<p>"Neither is there any mention of vice-chancellor
understanding the critic and conscience function legislated
for New Zealand universities or the institution’s Treaty
Partnership responsibilities."</p>

<p>Grey says Lincoln’s job
advertisement suggests it has forgotten what a university
is.</p>

<p>"Successful businesses would not accept such jargon
about ‘Transformational leadership’ and shaping ‘a
future-focused culture’. So why do our universities and
polytechnics persist with this failed pseudo-business
culture of decades past? Their most important job is simply
to teach and research, not to waffle on in meaningless
business-speak."</p>
