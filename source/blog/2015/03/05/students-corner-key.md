<p>Students Corner Key</p>

<p>A large crowd of students have
surrounded John Key’s lecture at the University of
Auckland Business School to protest his presence on
campus.</p>

<p>Spokesperson Mikaela Hunt said the students
assembled to show their dissent against the policies of the
National Government. “Our Prime Minister has declared war
without any democratic consultation in a bid to support the
United States’ imperial project in the Middle East.”</p>

<p>Hunt continued, “Additionally, this morning’s
Snowden leaks have confirmed John Key’s eagerness to
privilege US military interests over the autonomy of our
closest Pacific neighbours.”</p>

<p>“The fact that Key
is speaking about supply chain management is ironic given
the supply of troops he has committed to further destabilize
the Middle East. The product of this war supply chain is
profit for the global arms industry and, ultimately, access
to cheap oil. The cost has so far been the lives of hundreds
of thousands of Iraqis.”</p>

<p>“If the Prime Minister
is concerned about the rise of extremist groups like ISIS,
he should denounce the United States as war criminals,
responsible for the deaths of 135,716 – 153,318 people in
Iraq. The US invasion and unrelenting war on the Middle East
provided fertile ground for the rise of ISIS.”</p>

<p>Hunt said, “The number of students who spontaneously
joined the protest was a clear indication of the widespread
dissatisfaction with the National Government. Key’s
unilateral decision to place New Zealand in the middle of an
imperialist war is the last straw for many students. These
actions deserve no platform at a university campus,
enshrined in law as critic and conscience of society.”</p>
