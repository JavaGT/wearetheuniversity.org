         Campaign for democratic councils launches today</p><p>A nationwide campaign to get one-third of
seats set aside for democratically elected staff and
students on university and wānanga kicks off at Otago
University today at a rally with the university's registry
steps.</p><p>NZUSA president Rory McCourt and TEU president
Sandra Grey will both be speaking at the campaign
launch.</p><p>Grey notes the importance of institutional
autonomy for universities and wānanga:</p><p>“Institutional
autonomy means no single person or group – even our
parliament – should dominate our institutions councils.
That’s why having a third democratically-elected and
independent staff and student representation is so crucial
-. We need to counterbalance the growing power of the
ministerial
appointees.”</p><p>ends</p><p>
