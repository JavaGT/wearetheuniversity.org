         7 July 2015</p><p>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi
o Aotearoa</p><p>Victoria's new council needs democratic
accountability</p><p></p><p>Victoria University's proposed new
council will lack independence if it does not allow staff
and students to elect representatives says TEU national
president Sandra Grey.</p><p>The proposed new council includes
seats for two students and two academic experts who are or
have been employed by Victoria University. All of these
positions will be appointed rather than elected.</p><p>Grey says
staff have three concerns with the proposal.</p><p>The first is
that it does not make provision for all staff, or even any
staff, to have a voice on council. Experts in an academic
field who have previously worked at the university are not
the same as staff who currently work there.</p><p>The second is
the proposal lacks democratic accountability.</p><p>"Staff, all
staff, not just those who are academics, or those who are
'experts', should have a say on who represents them at
council," says Grey.</p><p>The third is that the focus on
'expert' academics excludes not just all the academics who
are still learning their profession, but all the general
staff who make up half the university's workforce and who
have important insights into the university's well-being and
governance.</p><p>Grey says the university needs to be brave and
trust its students and staff to continue to make wise
choices.</p><p>"The university needs to join the universities of
Auckland, Otago, Massey, Lincoln and Canterbury and put in
writing that all staff and students have the right to elect
council
representatives."</p><p>ends
