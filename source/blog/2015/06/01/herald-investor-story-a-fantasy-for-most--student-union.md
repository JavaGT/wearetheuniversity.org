         <strong>Herald investor story a fantasy for most – student
union</strong><br>01 June 2015<br>Media Release: New Zealand
Union of Students’ Associations </p><p>Reading today’s
<i>New Zealand Herald</i> will be a slap in the face for
most Auckland students, who are struggling to pay out of
control rents and face a lifetime of never entering the
property ladder thanks to crushing debt.</p><p>National student
union president Rory McCourt says while no one begrudges
student Brandon Lipman his success, his options to work full
time and save rent-free while studying were not available to
most students.</p><p>“Most students in Auckland pay over $200
a week in rent for a single room in a flat, plus food and
power. Mr Lipman has saved well over $20,800 by living at
home for free with his parents for two years.”</p><p>The
<i>Herald</i> did not go into whether Mr Lipman was
borrowing living costs, as most students do to pay for
basics like rent, accruing about $21,115 of debt over their
three-year degree.</p><p>Again, the Herald did not disclose
whether Mr Lipman was borrowing to pay university tuition
fees. For the overwhelming majority (74 per cent) of
students who do borrow for fees, the average borrowing
amount is $27,075 for a three-year degree.</p><p>On those
figures, Mr McCourt says, most students leave university
about $50,000 in the red.</p><p>Mr McCourt says most students
work an average of 17 hours a week, in addition to full-time
study. But the opportunity to work full-time, even at
nights, was not available to everyone.

<p>“If you’re on a
nursing, teaching or medical placement, you can’t do that
placement as well study as well as work
full-time.”</p><p>“Students are already working too many
hours. We as taxpayers support tertiary education to the
tune of billions of dollars so students can focus on their
studies and get the skills to contribute back. Tertiary
education should not be a low-wage employment
subsidy.”</p><p>Mr McCourt warned that stories like the
<i>Herald's</i> could misrepresent the reality of student
life and the prospects of the next generation.</p><p>“Things
have changed since our parent’s generation. There’s
constant assessment, part-time jobs don’t pay what they
did, rent has tripled as a share of student income and
summer jobs barely get you through the summer –let alone
paying for fees. That’s on top of the $14 billion student
debt millstone.”</p><p>“Most students are wondering how
they’ll afford next week’s rent or ever pay back their
mounting loan. Mr Lipman’s story is the exception, not the
reality.”<br>“It’s not about hard work anymore. It’s
about whether the making the Kiwi dream even adds up for the
next generation. The toxic mix of high rents, big debt and
insane house prices means for the majority, it doesn't.”
says McCourt.</p><p><i>Note: Borrowing figures are taken from
the Student Loan Scheme Annual Report 2014. Rent figures are

Employment’s bond database. Student work hour figures are

Survey 2014.</i><i></i></p><p>ENDS</p><p>
