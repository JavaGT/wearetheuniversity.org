         23 June 2015<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>Lincoln council opts for elected
staff representatives</p><p>Hundreds of petitions and many
submissions have convinced Lincoln University to make space
for elected staff representatives on its new
council.</p><p>Lincoln University Council voted this morning to
adopt a new council structure that includes seats for two
elected staff members. The council's initial proposal had
only one staff member in its structure, who would have been
appointed rather than elected.</p><p>TEU branch president Stu
Larsen is pleased with the decision. He says the university
management was supportive of the union running a campaign to
encourage submissions.</p><p>TEU submitted a petition signed by
over 500 people supporting democratically elected staff and
student positions on the council.</p><p>The council noted; "In
light of this feedback, it is considered appropriate to
retain the election of the staff and student
representatives."</p><p>It also noted that its new council
structure should include an elected general staff member who
has the same status as the academic staff member.</p><p>Larsen
says he is also pleased that the chair of academic board
will have a non-voting ex-officio seat on council.</p><p>"This
is an important protection for academic freedom and the
university's role as a critic and conscience of
society."</p><p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says
Lincoln's decision this morning is an important one that
upholds the important role staff and students play in their
university communities.</p><p>"We think Lincoln's willingness to
consult leads the way for other universities that are also
considering their new council compositions. We are flexible
about how each new council is designed, but it is crucial
they all include seats for the democratic voice of staff and
students."</p><p>ends
