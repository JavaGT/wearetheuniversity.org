         TEU leader wants to defend democracy</p><p>Today prolific
democracy campaigner and Victoria University academic  Dr
Sandra Grey takes up her position as president of the 10,000
strong Tertiary Education Union (TEU).</p><p>Tertiary education
is at the forefront of a battle to protect democracy in New
Zealand says Grey.</p><p>Grey, who helped lead the campaign to
keep MMP and has spent her academic career researching the
nature of democracy and dissent in New Zealand, says her job
as TEU president will remain focused on protecting
democracy.</p><p>“People working in tertiary education,
especially public tertiary education, have a unique ability
and duty to speak up and say things that otherwise may not
be said.</p><p>“Tertiary institutions and their staff and
students are, and should remain, independent of government
and corporate influence. One of TEU’s jobs is to advocate
and protect that independence, but also to make sure that
our members use that independence wisely and
often.”</p><p>Sandra Grey will be supported at TEU by three
vice-presidents, Cat Pause, a Human Development Senior
Lecturer and Fat Studies researcher at Massey University,
James Houkāmau, an Academic Support Coordinator for Māori
students at Whitireia NZ and Phil Edwards, Academic Leader
at Otago Polytechnic’s School of Sport and
Adventure.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
