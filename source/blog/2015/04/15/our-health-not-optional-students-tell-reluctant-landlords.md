<p>Our health not optional, students tell reluctant
landlords</p>

<p>15 April 2015</p>

<p> New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations </p><p>The national student union is
calling for the Government to urgently introduce minimum
heating and insulation standards for rentals off the back of
<a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radionz.co.nz%2Fnews%2Fnational%2F271094%2Flandlords-reluctant-on-insulation-scheme&amp;e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=landlords_wof&amp;n=1" target="_blank">reports by Radio New Zealand</a> that some
landlords are not willing to insulate cheaper
properties.</p>

<p>The call echoes statements from Green MP Kevin
Hague and Labour MP Poto Williams, both of whom said the
slow pick up showed the need for legislation.</p>

<p>National
student president Rory McCourt says “Students are often at
the bottom of the heap when it comes to quality of housing.
In lieu of standards it’s clear that some landlords think
the good health of their tenants is optional. It shouldn’t
be.”</p>

<p>“Clearly the market isn’t working. Students are
paying more than ever in rent, but their flats remain cold
and damp. Given how much students are forking out for flats,
we think landlords can and should foot the bill –
especially when there’s a subsidy.”</p>

<p>“Gone are the
days when it was a badge of honour to make it through the
winter in a crappy flat. With constant assessment and a
majority of students working over 15 hours a week to pay for
skyrocketing rents, there is simply no time to be sick. The
Government needs to step in – and fast.” says
McCourt.
