         27 November 2015<br>Media release<br>Tertiary Education
Union</p><p>Large CEO pay rises harming tertiary
education</p><p>Substantial pay rises for chief executives and
vice-chancellors at New Zealand’s polytechnics and
universities reveal growing inequality.</p><p>The State Services
Commission released the pay bands of New Zealand’s
tertiary education leaders yesterday.</p><p>Seven of the 19
universities, polytechnics and wānanga where the chief
executive and vice-chancellor did not change in the last two
years received a pay rise of more than $10,000.</p><p>Several of
those leaders who left, such as Lincoln’s Dr Andrew West
($117,000 for his last day of duty), seem to have received
substantial golden handshakes to see them on their
way.</p><p>The University of Auckland’s vice-chancellor Prof
Stuart McCutcheon saw his pay increase to over $680,000.
Some of the lowest paid people working at his university
earn $36,000. Professor McCutcheon earns that much in less
than three weeks.</p><p>Dr Peter Brothers at Manukau Institute
of Technology got a pay rise of over $60,000. During that
time, Dr Brothers oversaw more than 50 people at his
polytechnic losing their jobs and several courses
closed.</p><p>Chris Collins at EIT took a $50,000 pay rise of
over 16 percent, but tutorial assistants at his polytechnic
got a pay rise of only 1.5 percent.</p><p>TEU national president
Sandra Grey says these figures reveal growing inequality in
tertiary education.</p><p>“Our members have been campaigning
to make sure the people who earn the least get the biggest
percentage pay rise. We are working hard for a Living Wage
for everyone working in universities and
polytechnics.”</p><p>“It’s embarrassing to see our bosses
taking pay rises that they are not willing to offer to the
people who work for
them.”</p><p><br>ends
