         25 November 2015<br>Tertiary Education Union</p><p>Tertiary
education cuts are the important stat</p><p></p><p>Cherry picking statistics from the
latest OECD education survey doesn’t hide significant cuts
in education spending says TEU national president Sandra
Grey.</p><p>Government ministers are claiming that the OECD’s
latest Education at Glance report shows that
they are committed to public spending on
education.</p><p>However, Grey says the reality is that this
government is spending $300 million less this year on tertiary
education than it did in its first year in office in
2009.</p><p>“There have been cuts instead of adjustments for
inflation. And there have been cuts instead of adjustments
for the extra estimated 4000 funded tertiary education
students there are this year compared to 2009.”</p><p>“The
results have been more workload for people woking in
tertiary education, courses closing and more stress for
students who are under huge financial stress.”</p><p>Grey says
government ministers Joyce and Parata have browsed through a
500 page OECD report and cherry picked a few statistics to
spin their case.</p><p>"We could have done the same thing. For
instance, we could highlight the report shows that New
Zealand spends over US$1000 per student less on tertiary
education than the OECD average and US$3000 less per student
on tertiary education than Australia (p 211)."

<p>"But other
New Zealanders need to be wary because comparing education
data across countries - especially when taken out of context
like this - is comparing apples and oranges. It is
meaningless without the background."</p><p>Grey says the
government needs to stop congratulating itself and start
address the significant underfunding of tertiary education,
which is harming students and teachers’
well-being.</p><p><br>ends<!-- LINKS REMOVED
