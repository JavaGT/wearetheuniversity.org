<p>Academic
freedom threats more widespread than police data</p>

<p>The
case of the police withholding data from Dr Gilbert is a
breach of academic freedom but not an isolated one, says TEU
national president Dr Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Grey says government
departments are wary of damaging headlines and this has led
them to clamp down on public commentary from scientists.</p>

<p>A
survey last year by AUT’s Work Research Institute revealed
that nearly two-fifths of academics say that their level
of academic freedom is worse than when they started
work.</p>

<p>While there are some limited legitimate reasons why
some data cannot be public, the current presumption against
releasing data without a struggle is creating a climate of
silence.</p>

<p>Grey says this is a dangerous trend because it
means, at times, ministers do not have the full information
they need to make decisions.</p>

<p>“If we want strong public
debate and good policy making, research results need to be
public.  Where public interest is at stake, an academic
needs to release work publicly - no matter who funds the
research.”<p>

<p>Grey advises researchers not to take
contracts with strong gag clauses such as the one the police
tried to impose on Dr Gilbert.</p>

<p>“Fear of having contracts
cut or being blacklisted for our work can lead to
researchers double-guessing themselves
unconsciously.”</p>

<p>Grey says academics have a legal duty
under the Education Act to act as “critic and
conscience” of society.</p>

<p>“They cannot be our critic and
conscience if public agencies are actively discouraging
research that does not suit their public
image.”</p>
