<p><strong>Govt cannot dismiss
scientists</strong><br><strong></strong></p>

<p><br>When the
government dismisses scientific and academic evidence it
endangers the whole country, says TEU national president Dr
Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Last week the deputy prime minister called a
comprehensive report into rising sea levels ‘speculative’.</p>

<p>That report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for
the Environment was based on the work of highly regarded
scientists and academics from around New Zealand and the
rest of the world.</p>

<p>“By dismissing those scientists and
their work Bill English is not only ignoring strong
evidence, he is risking our future,” says Grey.</p>

<p>Grey is
calling on New Zealand academics to join the People’s Climate Marches this weekend
to show their support for academics and scientists who
continue to raise important issues despite the disparaging
and denigrating attitude they face from
politicians.</p>

<p>“Politicians cannot pick and choose what
evidence they want to hear. An overwhelming majority of
climate scientists and academics say there this is a real,
measurable, and urgent issue that we need to address. It is
not speculative.”<p>

<p>Grey says the current government has a
poor record denigrating scientists and academics with whom
it does not agree and this is resulting in poor policy
outcomes in a range of areas, especially climate
change.</p>

<p>Grey will be MCing the Wellington People’s Climate March at
Civic Square on 28 November,
1pm.</p>
