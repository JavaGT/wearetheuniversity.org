<p>New pay offer ends AUT dispute</p>

<p><br>TEU members at
Auckland University of Technology (AUT) have ended their
strike  action where they temporarily withheld assessment
grades for entry into the university’s database.</p>

<p>Late
last week AUT increased its pay offer to academic staff at
the university to 1.6 percent for the first year of the new
collective agreement and 2 percent for the second
year.</p>

<p>TEU members are pleased that AUT has come forward
with a better salary offer and, as an act of good faith, the
TEU bargaining team lifted the strike early ensuring
students will get their grades on time.</p>

<p>The union’s
negotiating team will formally present the new offer to
members at a meeting at AUT today.</p>

<p>“We took action to
get a better deal from AUT and, as a consequence of our
actions, AUT has improved its salary offer,” says branch
president John Prince.</p>

<p>“We are now continuing all our
duties and ending our action as an act of good
faith,”</p>

<p>Prince says the prompt new offer means that the
action union members took has not adversely affected any
students.</p>

<p>“We see this pay offer as a significant
improvement for our members. We are very pleased to have had
such solid support from people working in universities and
polytechnics across the rest of the country and also from
AUT's students,” says
Prince.</p>
