<p><strong>Student Leaders Say Goff Must Prove He’s on the
Side of Students</strong></p>

<p><strong>Auckland University
Students’ Association</strong></p>

<p><strong>November 5th,
2015</strong></p>

<p><strong>AUCKLAND</strong> - Auckland
University Students’ Association (AUSA) is urging Phil
Goff to make student issues one of his priorities in his
campaign for the Auckland Mayoralty.<p>

<p>The call comes after
today’s news that Mr Goff will be formally announcing his
Mayoral bid on November 22nd.<p>

<p>AUSA President-elect Will
Matthews said: “We welcome the competition and credibility
that Phil Goff injects into the race for the Mayoralty but
we challenge him, and all other candidates, to prove they
are deserving of student support.<p>

<p>“Auckland students
make up 50 per cent of the nationwide student population.
That means any candidate who can prove they are on the side
of students will be able to tap into a formidable voting
base.”<p>

<p>“Skilled and well educated young people are
the future of our country yet many students, particularly in
Auckland, face significant financial struggles.  We want to
see clear policies and commitment on housing, public
transport and employment issues in Auckland.”</p>

<p>According
to the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
Income and Expenditure Survey 2015, Auckland students face
the highest average rents in the country, forcing them
further from the city to find affordable accommodation.<p>

<p>Many students are also being forced to take on debt in
addition to their student loans to pay for other expenses.
For those who are able to find jobs, salary rates are often
insufficient to cover the cost of rent, food, power, public
transport and other necessities.<p>
<p>“Students should not
be expected to take on additional debt to be able to live
and study, while also having to face the prospect of not
being able to afford a home in the future.<p>

<p>“Another
issue is public transport. As students get pushed further
away from the city, it becomes more difficult and expensive
to travel in to University. In addition to tackling the
housing problem, we would like to see bigger subsidies for
students on public transport. Furthermore, more needs to be
done to integrate the Auckland public transport system with
the universities in the CBD. The City Rail Link project is
an improvement, but doesn't go far enough in ensuring that
the Universities are accessible. We want to see more done to
ensure that public transport is not only more affordable for
students, but also simple and direct.</p>

<p><br>“This shows
that Auckland students are struggling in a city that is
supposedly one of the most liveable in the world.</p>

<p>“This
is an unacceptable and unsustainable situation for students
living in Auckland, and we urge Phil Goff to address this in
his campaign and if he becomes Mayor.</p>

<p>“This is a chance
for Mr Goff to depart from his legacy of the 1980s as the
architect of the student loan system and work to bring about
real change for a large group of people who are vital to the
Auckland economy and the future of New
Zealand.”</p>
