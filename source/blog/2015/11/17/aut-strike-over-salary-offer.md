         <strong>AUT strike over salary offer</strong></p><p>People at
Auckland University of Technology (AUT) are on strike this
week to achieve an improved salary offer from the
university. </p><p>Pay at AUT and at all New Zealand
universities is falling behind comparable private sector
salary increases, says TEU’s national industrial officer
Irena Brorens. </p><p>“AUT is in a financial position where it
can afford better pay for the people who work for its
students.” </p><p>TEU members are seeking a relatively modest
pay rise of 2.5 percent for each of the next two years.
</p><p>Brorens says the nature of the strike is to not release
student or course marks to AUT for inputting into its
database ARION.  </p><p>"People working at universities are
always very reluctant to take any action that affects our
students. It is entirely possible for the university to
settle this agreement before any student is affected. This
is what we want to achieve." </p><p>The strike notice is valid
for a week, until Sunday 22 November, but TEU members may
decide on further actions.  </p><p>“Our collective agreement
expired in June and we have been negotiating for fairer
paywith AUT since then. We need to resolve this
quickly,” says John Prince, TEU branch president at AUT.
</p><p>Brorens says the union believes that AUT can solve this
dispute quickly and easily. </p><p>TEU members are meeting with
AUT negotiators on
Thursday.</p><p>ENDS
