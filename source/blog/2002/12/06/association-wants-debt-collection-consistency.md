<p>Press Release - For Immediate Use</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Governments
decision not to pursue what could amount to millions of
dollars in bad debts arising from inefficiencies in the
student allowance scheme has been met with concern by
student leaders.<p>

<p>The President of the Auckland University
Students Association, Mr Ross Burns, this afternoon
questioned the decision in the light of the ongoing debate
over the lack of student access to the Emergency
Unemployment Benefit.<p>

<p>"While the Government continually
blames a lack of money for its ongoing refusal to allow the
majority of students to access the Emergency Unemployment
Benefit over the summer, they are willing to let the actions
of a small minority of individuals cost the country millions
of dollars without punishment" said Mr Burns.<p>

<p>The AUSA
President went on to comment that, in failing to pursue this
money, the Government was effectively allowing a situation
where a small group have been able to able profit
handsomely, while many students struggle through the summer
months living hand to mouth.</p>
