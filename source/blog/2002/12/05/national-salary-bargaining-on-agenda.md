on agenda for university staff</p>

<p>The annual conference of
the Association of University Staff (AUS) has unanimously
endorsed a new national approach to industrial bargaining
and salary-setting for its 6,000 members at New Zealand’s
universities.</p>

<p>The conference, held in Wellington this
week, gave the green light for the Association to pursue a
new national bargaining strategy in 2003 centered on
negotiating national collective employment agreements. They
will replace the enterprise-based agreements currently
negotiated separately at each university. Two new agreements
are proposed, one for academic staff and another for general
staff.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan, said that
a national collective agreement for university staff would
bring greater consistency, collaboration and efficiency to
industrial matters within the sector. “Furthermore, it is
perfectly in tune with the changes being made to the
Government’s tertiary funding formula We trust that
employers will also see the advantages of national
bargaining and will cooperate with the process”, he
said.</p>

<p>Addressing the AUS conference Associate Education
Minister, Steve Maharey, said that the Government was
comfortable with multi-employer bargaining within the
university sector as it is consistent with the collaborative
intent of the tertiary education
reforms.</p>
