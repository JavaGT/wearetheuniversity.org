Representation on Tertiary Commission<br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) today called for the establishment of
a tertiary staffing advisory group and for staff
representation on the Tertiary Education Commission.</p>

<p>The
call comes after today’s announcement that a learner
(student) advisory committee will be established and a
non-voting student will be appointed to the Tertiary
Education Commission Board.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr
Grant Duncan, said that the Association has been promoting
the concept of a university reference group, but the need
for a staff advisory committee was also vitally important.
Fundamental issues such as workforce planning, funding,
terms and conditions of employment, and overall resources
for teaching and research require specific staff input.</p>

<p>Dr
Duncan said that the Commission is a high level policy group
with a broad strategic responsibility, but needs specific
staff input to provide guidance on the operational
implications of its decisions.  Today’s announcement paves
the way for such a group to be established.</p>

<p>Dr Duncan
welcomed the appointment of a non-voting student
representative to the Board but said that similar
representation needs to be established for staff. “Staff and
students form the basis of our tertiary education sector. It
is appropriate that both groups are at the table when
decisions about the sector are being made”, said Dr Duncan.
“While Mr. Maharey had initially said that the Tertiary
Education Commission was not to be a representative group,
the appointment of a student representative now signals this
is no longer the case”.</p>

<p>“The proposed tertiary education
reforms will have a significant effect on staff and the
establishment of a staff advisory committee, and a staff
position on the Board, will provide a greater basis of
support for the reform programme”, said Dr
Duncan.</p>
