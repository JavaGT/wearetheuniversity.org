Support for Four Weeks Holiday</p>

<p>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) today urged all members of the
Government to support the call for increased annual holidays
for all workers.</p>

<p>Association President, Dr Grant Duncan,
said today that the Association believed it timely that
Progressive Coalition MP, Matt Robson’s, private member’s
Bill which seeks to increase the minimum annual holiday
entitlement from three weeks to four is to be considered by
Parliament.</p>

<p>“While many university employees presently
have four weeks annual leave, there are still some
university and many private sector employees who only have
the current statutory minimum of three weeks”, said Dr
Duncan. “At a time when workloads and productivity are
increasing, three weeks is no longer a sufficient holiday
entitlement. An average academic staff member now works 53
hours per week, a level which is not sustainable without
additional leave.”</p>

<p>Dr Duncan said the Association was
concerned by statements attributed to the Associate Minister
of Education, Steve Maharey, prior to the general election,
that Labour did not want to see holidays increased. In
calling on Labour and United Future MPs to support Matt
Robson’s bill, Dr Duncan said that employers had shown they
could not be relied upon to increase leave entitlements, and
it was up to Government to provide that
leadership.</p>
