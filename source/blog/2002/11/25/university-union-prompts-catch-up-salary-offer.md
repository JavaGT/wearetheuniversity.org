         <br>University union prompts 'catch up' salary offer at
Auckland </p><p>     Salary settlements at other New Zealand
universities have prompted the   University of Auckland to
make a supplementary 2.5% salary offer to staff,   effective
from 1 February next year.</p><p>     Auckland University  had
settled on a 4.5% pay deal over 2 years from 1   February
this year, but settlements reached by the Association of  
University   Staff (AUS) at other universities have created
a benchmark of at least 7%   over the same two year period.
AUS members at Massey, Victoria and Otago   have all
recently reached agreement with their employers, and Waikato
staff   will vote on a renewed offer next week.</p><p>    
Auckland has consequently been left lagging behind other
universities,   resulting in the decision by Auckland Vice
Chancellor, John Hood, to   increase salaries by the further
2.5%.</p><p>     AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly, said that
the Auckland settlement had   left the door open for further
pay increases, although dependent on   Government funding
increases. While the University had initially claimed   the 
increase for 2003 was insufficient to provide further salary
increases, it   has now been forced to find the money from
an internal un-allocated fund   called the Planned Case
Initiative Fund.</p><p>     Helen Kelly said staff  welcomed the
increase but questioned why the   University did not make
the offer in the original negotiations.  She said   the
'catch up' confirmed the AUS view that University bargaining
patterns   are so similar, they simply follow each other,
making multi employer   bargaining the logical and efficient
step to pursue in the next bargaining   round for both the
union and the employers.
