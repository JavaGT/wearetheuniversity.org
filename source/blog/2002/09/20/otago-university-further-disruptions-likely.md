Reporters	</p><p>20 September 2002</p><p></p><p>Otago University:
Further disruptions likely but exam action lifted</p><p><br>Over
700 Otago University union members met yesterday to consider
the latest employer offer in the long-running dispute that
has seen unprecedented industrial action at the
university.</p><p>Two Collective Employment Agreements are under
negotiation, one covering general staff, the other
academics.</p><p>General staff voted, by a narrow margin, to
take the offer of 3% to formal ratification next week.
Academic staff overwhelmingly rejected the same offer.
However union members voted to lift the action withholding
exam questions, meaning end-of-year exams will
proceed.</p><p>Combined Unions' spokesperson, Dr Shef Rogers,
said that it appears unlikely that settlement will be
reached for either agreement next week. "General staff voted
narrowly to take the offer to ratification, but not at a
level that would be high enough to ratify."</p><p>Dr Rogers said
the union negotiators met with the employer team after the
stopwork meeting, raising issues that needed to be addressed
to secure ratification for general staff and to progress
academic discussions. "However the attitude of the employer
this afternoon was not at all productive to reaching
settlement,” said Dr Rogers. “There was a refusal to shift
on any issues, despite our moves on the exams. We will hold
urgent meetings tomorrow of academic staff and begin rolling
stoppages from Monday morning." </p><p>Dr Rogers expected that
general staff members would also be unhappy about the tone
of discussions and would reject the current offer at their
meeting next Friday. "It is intensely frustrating to have
been this close to a partial settlement, only to meet with
stony silence from the other side of the
table."</p><p><br>Contact <br>Shef Rogers <br>03 479-8892 work
