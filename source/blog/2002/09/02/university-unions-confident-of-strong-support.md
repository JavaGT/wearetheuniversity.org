<p>UNIVERSITY UNIONS
CONFIDENT OF STRONG SUPPORT<p>

<p>The combined unions are
expecting strong support for the strike at the University of
Otago today spokesman Dr Shef Rogers said.</p>

<p>Union members
voted to implement a half day strike from 12.15 PM in
support of an 8% pay claim in their collective agreement
negotiations with the University of Otago.  Union members
have also voted to implement rolling stoppages and a work to
rule if no breakthrough in the negotiations is achieved
after the strike.</p>

<p>"We are not fazed by the Vice
Chancellors predictions that our members will not support
the strike and that classes will not be affected by the
action.  The huge turnout at the stopwork meeting and clear
support for the strike action resolutions tells us that
members will support this action and classes will face major
disruption today."</p>

<p>"We say to students that if they are
concerned about classes being cancelled then they are
welcome to join our march and support the action we are
taking, or stay home and avoid the disappointment of turning
up to an empty lecture theatre."</p>

<p>Unions members will cease
work at 12.15 PM and gather outside the central library for
a march past the Registry building.  Members will then march
from the Dental School to the Octagon from 1
PM.</p>
