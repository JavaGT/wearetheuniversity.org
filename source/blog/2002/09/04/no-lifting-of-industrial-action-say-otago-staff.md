<p>Attention Education and Industrial
Reporters</p>



<p>No lifting of industrial action say Otago
University staff</p>

<p>The Otago University Combined Unions
Negotiating Team met today to discuss how to further
progress employment agreement negotiations.<p>

<p>The huge show
of support for university staff strike action on Monday has
seen the Vice-Chancellor quoted in the Otago Daily Times as
saying that "the university would be prepared to negotiate
beyond 1.5% to get this thing settled."</p>

<p>Combined Unions
spokesperson, Dr Shef Rogers, said that the unions have
decided to attempt mediation through the Employment
Relations Mediation Service as a possible way forward, in
the hope that this may see a new offer from the employer
that enables formal negotiation to recommence.<p>

<p>“There
will be no lifting of the current action around withholding
exam questions, however, until a new offer is before
members, and such action is rescinded by a vote of members,”
said Dr Rogers.</p>
