strings attached to private funding of research</p><p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has accused the
Minister responsible for Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey,
of failing to provide any satisfactory assurance that
government-sponsored partnerships between universities and
private enterprise will protect academic
freedom.</p><p>According to a Ministerial press release, Mr
Maharey told a Business NZ audience that such partnerships
would involve private-sector investment in universities,
“while upholding the values of academic freedom, scientific
rigour and critical inquiry.” But Dr Grant Duncan, AUS
National President, pointed out that the published goals and
criteria for Cabinet approval of funding for such
partnerships say nothing at all about academic freedom,
scientific rigour or critical inquiry – and further criteria
provided in response to an AUS request refer only generally
and vaguely to such issues.</p><p>“Mr Maharey’s framework for
approval does not ensure that his government’s drive to
commercialise university funding will in practice uphold the
values that are crucial to the university’s role in the
advancement of knowledge.</p><p>“His current assurances on this
matter must, therefore, be taken with a grain of salt. The
Labour-led government is enthusiastically pursuing the
commercialisation of publicly-funded education and research
under the guise of so-called ‘relevance’ and ‘excellence’.
Its commitment to the university’s role as an autonomous
producer of knowledge and as society’s independent critic
and conscience seems little more than lip service.
</p>
<p>Dr
Duncan continued, “It is likely, if this initiative proceeds
as is, that universities will eventually become dependent on
private enterprise, just as they are now dependent on
overseas students. We are also concerned that this will
provide an excuse for government not to increase needed
public investment in tertiary education.”</p><p>Dr Duncan
suggested that the best approach would be to strengthen the
academic freedom and the ‘critic and conscience’
requirements for universities under the Education Act to
ensure that neither the government nor the institutions
could permit any deals with private enterprise that result
in universities being used, for example, as promotional
tools or as training departments of big business.
Alternatively, as well as requiring ‘a thorough business
case’ to support proposals for funding, strict, explicit
criteria to protect academic freedom should be met. </p><p>“Most
importantly,” said Dr Duncan, “There must be no strings
attached to any private funding and university staff must be
able to fulfil their obligation to conduct independent,
publicly- available research.”</p><p></p><p>Contact: <br>Dr Grant
