University Staff (AUS) National President Dr Grant Duncan
welcomed the announcement today by the Minister for Tertiary
Education, Steve Maharey, of a strategic review and plan for
the tertiary education workforce.</p><p>“This Labour policy
recognises that Government must ensure that the tertiary
education workforce is sustainable.  The staffing issues in
the universities have been neglected for too long. 
University staff salaries and conditions fall well below
those of their counterparts overseas and these people work
in an international market.  There are no national data kept
on the make-up of the workforce and there is no national
planning to ensure universities can continue to get the
staff they need.  This policy will enable the sector to work
together with the Tertiary Education Commission to address
the situation, and it will reinforce the role of Government
in ensuring that universities are adequately funded to meet
true staffing costs,” said Dr Duncan.</p><p>Dr Duncan said AUS
also welcomed a number of other initiatives in the policy,
including setting funding levels for institutions on a
three-year cycle, focussing attention on the training and
development of tertiary-level teachers, increasing the
number of Centres of Research Excellence, increasing funding
available for the Performance-Based Research Fund and
introducing a pool of funding to enable new researchers to
begin their research careers.

<p>“The main problem in the
university sector is a lack of funding from the Government
to the institutions.  Since 1990 AUS has been warning that
planning is needed to sustain the university workforce.  The
policies announced today go some way to recognising the key
role staff will play in all the plans Government has for the
sector. Their aim is to sustain and improve the quality of
research and teaching in the tertiary sector,” he said. “You
can’t have high-quality university education and research
without the development of a high-quality professional
workforce. It looks like we are now getting some active
recognition of that from the Minister, and this will be
welcomed by AUS members.”</p><p><br>Contact:<br>Dr Grant Duncan,
