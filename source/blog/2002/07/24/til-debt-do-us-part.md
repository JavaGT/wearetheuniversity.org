<p>‘Til Debt Do Us Part</p>

<p>As part of the winter
orientation events, the Auckland University Students’
Association will be holding a marriage ceremony today at 1pm
in the Auckland University Quad in protest over access to
student allowances.</p>

<p>“We believe that it is ridiculous that
by the age of 18 students are considered old enough to:
vote, marry, and be jailed for defrauding the student
allowance system, but are considered a child dependent on
our parents until the age of 25 for income support,” said Ms
Thompson.<p>

<p>“Nearly one third of the $5 billion owed by
current and former students is due to living costs. If
political parties are serious about reducing student debt
they must widen eligibility to student allowances so that
students are not forced into such drastic measures to avoid
going into debt to pay for their food and rent,” concluded
Ms Thompson.</p>
