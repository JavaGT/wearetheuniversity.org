appointed to the position of AUS General Secretary,
commencing on 27 May.</p>

<p>Helen is currently Assistant
Secretary, Professional/Industrial, at NZEI, a role which
has given her oversight of large and very significant
industrial negotiations and of policy development for a
major education-sector union.<p>

<p>She was formerly a
schoolteacher (Dip Teaching), was an AUS Branch Organiser at
Victoria (1996-97), and is currently completing an LLB at
Victoriaâ€™s School of Law.</p>

<p>Helen will bring to AUS a sharp
intellect and a strong political and industrial strategic
focus that will both serve the interests of all members and
strengthen AUS as a union
organisation.</p>
