<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz "><br>VICTORIA
UNIVERSITY STAFF TO STRIKE</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz "><br>After a delayed reply to a
staff letter which attempted to settle current employment
agreement negotiations, Victoria University has made it
clear that it is not interested in settling its employment
dispute in the near future. Staff will, therefore, go on
strike from 1pm this Wednesday (27th March) until 1pm
Thursday (28th March) to seek an improved offer.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">"Staff
proposed a compromise which would settle negotiations" AUS
General Staff Branch President Tony Quinn stated. "Members
had committed to settling with the university for a lower
salary increase in order to demonstrate a desire to conclude
negotiations. The university's refusal to accept the
counter-offer from staff clearly indicates it is not
interested in resolving outstanding matters."</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">The letter,
from Association of University Staff and Public Service
Association staff, asked the university to withdraw a late
claim to alter the term of the employment agreement, which
was made after the unions called off a planned strike for 4
March. </a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">"We believe that this proposed term will
disadvantage us in our future negotiations. Members have
made it very clear to us that they want this claim
withdrawn," said Christine McCarthy, AUS Academic Branch
President. "Now staff will strike and are no longer willing
to compromise their position."

<p>AUS Branch Presidents, Tony
Quinn and Christine McCarthy, say staff are disappointed
that the university has refused the counter-offer in its
entirety. “They cannot comprehend the actions of the
Vice-Chancellor – this unwillingness to resolve negotiations
leaves staff with no option but to take industrial
action.”</p>
