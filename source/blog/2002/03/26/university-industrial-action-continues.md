<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Members of the
Association of University Staff (AUS) and other campus-based
unions are continuing industrial action throughout New
Zealand this week.  The action arises because salary offers
made by university vice-chancellors have been both
inadequate and have failed to take account of recruitment
and retention, and workload issues.<p>

<p>At Victoria, where
members will commence a 24-hour strike at 1 p.m. tomorrow,
the action also focuses on issues relating to the term of
the collective agreement.</p>

<p>While the Victoria strike is
under way, staff at Waikato, Massey and Lincoln Universities
will undertake other forms of action.</p>

<p>Members at Waikato,
where negotiations are currently under way, will attend
stop-work meetings tomorrow to receive a progress report on
negotiations and consider recommendations from the Campus
Action Committee.</p>

<p>Massey University has been involved in
mediated negotiations with the Association and members are
meeting tomorrow to discuss a new employer offer. As a
gesture of goodwill before the second day of mediated talks
(scheduled for Thursday 28 March), a ballot on further
industrial action has been postponed for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Lincoln
staff will attend membersâ€™ meetings tomorrow at which the
Vice-Chancellor, Dr Frank Wood, and Human Resources Manager,
Luke Southorn, will endeavour to explain to members why
there has been no change in their offer.  Members will then
determine the AUS response and consider what further action,
if any, may be necessary.</p>
