2002</p><p>University staff to go on strike 4 March</p><p>Staff at
the majority of New Zealand’s universities are planning
strike action for Monday 4 March.</p><p>The Association of
University Staff [AUS], which covers most union members at
the universities, says that salary offers have once again
been unacceptably low.</p><p>The union claim of 8 per cent for
most groups of staff is intended to begin to bring
university salaries back to a level comparable with
international and national trends. It has been met by
employer offers ranging from 1.5 to 4 per cent,
however.</p><p>“University academic salary scales here have
fallen in real terms over the past two decades, and are well
behind those in Australia,” commented the Association’s
National President, Dr Grant Duncan. “General staff salaries
have fallen well behind inflation in the same period. Offers
that barely keep abreast of inflation do not remedy
that.”</p><p>“The present strike action is a symptom of a long
and frustrating process for staff who have experienced
rising workloads and consistently below-average salary
increases over the last decade or more.”</p><p>“New Zealand will
begin to face difficulty in recruiting and retaining a
high-calibre academic workforce. Many are due to retire, and
others will leave for overseas positions and into other
professions due to the relatively low salaries in the
sector. Specialist general staff positions are equally under
threat.”

<p>The industrial action at those campuses that have
not yet ratified employment agreements would be supplemented
by lunchtime protests at campuses that have already
settled.</p><p>Dr Duncan commented that the present industrial
action is also a symptom of failures by successive
governments to invest in quality university education and
research.</p><p>“Although New Zealand is performing
comparatively well in terms of participation rates in
tertiary education, the next goal must be to raise the
comparable quality of education and research provided within
our universities.</p><p>“The staff of the universities embody
the key knowledge-bases and teaching qualities required for
the achievement of internationally credible degree-granting
and research-productive institutions.”</p><p>Dr Duncan estimated
that public funding of universities would have to rise
considerably if New Zealand wishes to keep pace with global
developments.</p><p><br>Contact:<br>Dr Grant Duncan, AUS
