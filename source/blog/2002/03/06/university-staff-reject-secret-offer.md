<p>University staff reject secret offer to
universities</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff [AUS] has
expressed dismay at reports of a 4.5% increase in Government
funding of student numbers at universities in return for
another freeze on student fees.</p>

<p>Dr Grant Duncan, National
President of AUS said, “The 4.5% figure, supposedly
discussed in  secret with the vice-chancellors, is simply
not adequate for rebuilding the sector.”</p>

<p>“The net effect
of such an offer, given the fee-freeze and discounting
inflation, would be to leave institutions in the same mire
that they are presently in.”</p>

<p>“Further industrial unrest,
like that which has occurred this week, would be the
inevitable outcome.”</p>

<p>“To make a fee-freeze deal acceptable
to staff, an increase in government funding in the range of
12 to 20% would be essential to reinvest in and rebuild a
sector that everyone knows has been underfunded for
years.”</p>

<p>“Another way to solve the problems would be to
have cumulative 12% increases each year for the next 3
years,” said Dr Duncan.</p>

<p>“Increases of 12% or more would
mean that government would no longer be forcing university
staff to pay for the fee freeze through increasing workloads
and decreasing salary scales.”</p>

<p>“4.5% is a recipe for
further unrest in the sector,' warned Dr Duncan. ‘It
illustrates Government’s duplicitous role. The Minister
claims that he has no direct role in industrial relations
and yet Government makes funding decisions that directly
predetermine industrial outcomes in the
universities.”<p>
<p>“The goal of a 12% increase in government
funding for three years would require an estimated $91.3
million in the first year, if student participation remains
stable; or a total new input of $593 million over the next 3
years. These goals should be reflected in the 2002-3 Budget
and the new money should be invested in reducing
staff-student ratios and offering competitive salaries.” Dr
Duncan emphasised that, “The kind of money we're talking
about is less than that invested in rescuing Air New
Zealand.”</p>

<p>“If the Budget figure is inadequate, AUS may be
forced to reject further fees stabilisation policies,
eventhough we do not wish to see student fees rise,” said Dr
Duncan.</p>
