Reporters	<br>16 August 2002</p><p><br>University of Otago staff
say no to setting exams</p><p><br>University of Otago academic
and general staff union members today voted to withhold exam
questions until the employer puts an improved pay offer on
the table. A half-day strike on September 2 has also been
called if progress in negotiations has not been
made.</p><p>Negotiations between the university and the combined
union team, representing members of the Association of
University Staff (AUS), the Public Service Association
(PSA), Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union (EPMU),
NZ Building Trades Union (NZBTU) and the Amalgamated Workers
Union (AWUNZ) broke down on Wednesday after the employer
refused to increase the salary offer of 1.5%</p><p>More than 350
members attended meetings called to discuss the state of
negotiations. Combined Unions spokesperson, Shef Rogers,
said union members were appalled that the employer offer
remained below the rate of inflation, effectively forcing
staff to take a cut in income.</p><p>"We are disappointed that
again the university employer has created a situation where
members feel they are left with no option other than taking
action to achieve a reasonable settlement. Unfortunately, it
seems this is the only thing the employer will listen to.
Otago union members embarked on a campaign of action earlier
this year that included withholding exam marks and working
to rule. Last minute negotiations prevented the disruption
of enrolment in February. "We thought the administration had
come to realise that staff salaries have to be a priority
for the institution, but nothing in these negotiations so
far has indicated that. We are disappointed to be back in
conflict so soon, and we hope that the offer can be
increased quickly," added Dr. Rogers.

<p>"It is not our
desire to cause difficulties for students. However, our
employer has demonstrated it will only respond to this type
of action. We have informed the Students' Association, who
understand our anger at the paltry salary offer. It is our
hope that students will let the Vice-Chancellor know that
this is an unacceptable way to treat staff, who have seen
their salaries decline in real terms over the past decade
while facing increased workloads as student numbers have
increased."</p><p>A stopwork meeting has been called for August
28, in the hope that the employer will have improved the
offer by then--otherwise further industrial action is
likely.</p><p>Contact:<br>Shef Rogers 479 8892 (work) 4730-527
