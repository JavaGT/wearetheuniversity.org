<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">Vote for Strike at Otago University
“Overwhelming”</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">679 members of the five combined unions at
Otago University attended stopwork meetings in Dunedin,
Christchurch and Wellington over the past two days. Members
of these unions represent academic, general and trades staff
from throughout the institution.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">All three meetings
discussed the breakdown in collective employment agreement
negotiations, after the employer refused to move beyond a
1.5% salary increase. Secret ballots were held to confirm
strike action set for Monday 2 September and possible
rolling stoppages to follow, if no significant progress is
made, while the other four resolutions listed below were
overwhelmingly endorsed by a show of hands.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">These
resolutions are in addition to the withholding of exam
questions which was agreed to by members at meetings last
week. Exam questions are to be withheld until the offer from
the employer increases significantly. Dr. Shef Rogers,
Spokesperson for the Combined Unions, commented, “Staff
regret the need to take such actions and sincerely hope that
the issues can be resolved quickly to avoid any further
disruption for students. However, after more than a decade
of eroding conditions and salaries, staff are not willing to
accept an effective pay cut relative to current CPI
estimates of 2.9%.  The employer’s offer of 1.5% is
particularly insulting because the government has already
offered the University 4.5% on its teaching income, which
amounts to an increase of just over 3% in its total
budget.”

<p>The atmosphere at all three meetings was
consistently described as focussed, serious and determined.
Dr. Rogers pointed out that if Monday’s strike were not
averted, it would be the first in Otago’s history. “I’d
rather the University were in the news for all the valuable
teaching and research that goes on here. But these
resolutions are an expression of staff concerns about
recruitment and salary relativities, and their ultimate
purpose is to ensure that Otago remains an outstanding
educational institution.” A senior staff source, quoted in
the Otago Daily Times today, said that the proposed action
would: “…shut this place down when you consider that most of
the permanent staff are involved.”</p>

<p>The Resolutions:</p>

<p>1.
(Voted on by secret ballot). Members reconfirm our intention
to strike from 12:15 pm Monday 2 September 2002 for a half
day.<br>91% in favour; 9% against</p>

<p>2. The negotiating team
shall have the authority to issue dispensations from strike
action where this is deemed appropriate.<br>99% in favour,
two abstentions</p>

<p>3. No union member shall assist with
reporting staff participation or non-participation in any
industrial action, but shall ignore such requests or return
a notice stating that ' Due to current industrial action, I
am unable to respond to your request.'<br>99% in favour,
three abstentions</p>

<p>4. Should any member of these combined
unions be suspended by the employer for participating in
industrial action, all members of these combined unions
shall stop work immediately upon notification and not return
to work until meetings have resolved on how to
proceed.<br>99% in favour, two absentions</p>

<p>5. (Voted on by
secret ballot). Members authorise the combined unions
negotiating team to plan and initiate rolling stoppages
across all campuses with the intention of minimising notice
and maximising disruption of employer activities.<br>91% in
favour; 9% against, 1 abstentions (written on ballot)</p>

<p>6.
If by Monday 9 September, no significant offer of increase
has been made by the employer, the negotiating team is

areas.<br>99% in favour, two absentions</p>
