<p><br>     
Collective Agreements Settled at University of Waikato<p>

<p><br>Members of the Association of University Staff (AUS),
the Public Service Association (PSA) and Association of
Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) yesterday voted by a
majority to accept the University of Waikato’s latest salary
offer.<p>

<p>This gives all members of those unions who are
covered by the collective employment agreements a salary
increase of 3.2% from 1 October 2001.<p>

<p>“Members are
pleased at a positive settlement, given the depressing
beginning of negotiations six months ago,” said AUS Waikato
Branch President, Stan Jones.<p>

<p>"We were particularly
pleased to see backdating to the end of the last agreement
and the understanding that this applies to our members
only”.<p>

<p>“The whole process happened against a background
of the permanent financial crisis caused by successive
governments deliberately reducing the investment the country
has to make in its university system."<p>

<p>"Despite the
difficulties this situation continues to produce, Waikato
shows how all parties in the negotiations have managed a
settlement in the best interests of this campus and the
community it serves."<p>
