Education Reports:</p><p>INDUSTRIAL ACTION AT VICTORIA
UNIVERSITY<br>FINAL GRADES TO BE WITHHELD</p><p><br>Commitments
from Victoria University academic staff to withhold final
grades poured in yesterday,as soon as AUS requested that
members indicate how many final grades would be affected by
their actions.  Within only a few hours staff had committed
to withhold nearly 2500 (2492) grades.  AUS Branch
Presidents expect it will take one to two weeks to collect
and collate all of the commitments from their academic
members but are very pleased with the results from the first
half day.</p><p>"This action is a result of the frustration
staff are feeling about the Vice-Chancellor's stance in
negotiations.  Staff cannot comprehend why the
Vice-Chancellor has made his offer of 3.2% conditional on
clawbacks which will compromise our ability to bargain in
future negotiations" said Tony Quinn, AUS General Staff
Branch President.</p><p>These clawbacks include a late claim
from the university to alter the term of the agreement,
after staff had called off a strike on March 4th.  This
claim would schedule the early stages of negotiations in
December and January, after the university budget has been
set, and when most staff must take annual leave because
teaching time restricts their ability to take leave at other
times.  In addition the university has requested a
Memorandum of Understanding which links 1.2% of the 3.2% to
Government funding.

<p>"Most other universities have settled
or are about to settle without conditions of this sort,"
said Christine McCarthy, AUS Academic Branch President.  "In
addition, union members at these universities have been
assured that non-union staff will have limited benefit from
their collective negotiations.  Victoria University is
unusual in its resistance to resolving negotiations. 
Waikato staff have been offered 3.2%, Massey has offered
3.5% and Canterbury staff have an offer of 3.2% despite
their financial difficulties." </p><p>Victoria University has
made a remarkable recovery from a projected budget deficit
of $2.8 million to a profit of $5.1 million - a $7.9 million
improvement over budget.  The AUS attributes this profit to
increasing staff workloads as student numbers increase. 
Last year, staff carried the burden of a huge increase in
student numbers.  Student revenue increased 10%  - while
spending on staff only increased 1.4%. (source: Victoria
University Annual Reports:
http://www.vuw.ac.nz/annualreports/)</p><p>"Today it was
announced that staff must cope with further increases in
student numbers - this time of 3.9%.  This is almost double
the 2% increase which was predicted.  We are facing
increasing pressures on staff in all areas: academics,
librarians, technicians, and administration.  At the same
time the Vice-Chancellor is trying to limit our ability to
bargain in negotiations" said Tony
Quinn.</p><p><br>contacts:<br>Tony Quinn, AUS General Staff
