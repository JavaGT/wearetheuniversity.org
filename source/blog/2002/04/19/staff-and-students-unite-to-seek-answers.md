         Staff And Students Unite To Seek Answers From
University</p><p>Staff and students representatives at Victoria
University will be presenting the Vice Chancellor with forms
from students asking for fees back for classes missed due to
the staff strike held on the 27th and 28th March.  The forms
will be presented on a hospital stretcher to symbolise the
wounds and divisions caused by the University’s attitude
towards the staff contract negotiations.</p><p>‘Hundreds of
students filled out forms, realising that the University
saved money by not paying staff when they were on strike. 
Students are expecting a response from the Vice Chancellor
about when the University will cough up and return fees to
students’ said Victoria University Students’ Association
President Fleur Fitzsimons.</p><p>"That staff need to go on
strike, and that students do not automatically get
compensated for cancelled classes and reduced services, is
indicative of the unhealthy state of Victoria University. 
Financially Victoria may be on the road to recovery, but it
has a long way to go in many other areas," said Association
of University Staff Co-President Christine
McCarthy.</p><p>Co-president Tony Quinn agreed "The current
offer to staff is conditional on claims which will limit our
ability to bargain in future negotiations.  For an
institution that says it values academic freedom, attempting
to hamper future negotiations with staff seems a bit sick. 
Other NZ universities are not treating their staff in this
way."</p><p>‘The forms will be presented to the Vice Chancellor
on a hospital stretcher to symbolise an institution which
should be a unified body of staff, students and management
but which is wounded due to the exploitative approach taken
by management and its refusal to recognise the value of
hardworking staff’, said Association of University Staff
Co-President Christine McCarthy.</p><p>‘We have invited the Vice
Chancellor along to the hand over to tell staff and students
what the Universities response will be to the students
request.  He should front up and let students know what the
story is’, continued Fitzsimons.</p><p>The ceremony will take
place at 12noon in the Hunter Courtyard at Victoria
University.</p><p>Ends
