<p>Media release<br>24 April 2002 <br>Attention
Education and Industrial Reporters</p>





<p>Lincoln
University staff ratify employment agreement</p>

<p><br>Lincoln
University academic staff members of the Association of
University Staff [AUS] voted today to ratify the employer's
offer for a collective employment agreement.<p>

<p>The offer is
for a 3% salary increase from 15 May 2002, a further 2% from
2 January 2003, and a commitment to a further negotiated
increase from 1 April 2003. The term of the agreement is to
31 October 2002.<p>

<p>Lincoln AUS Branch President, Dr Jim
McAloon, said that the early expiry date, similar to that
achieved in other universities, was a critical feature of
the offer as it allowed the possibility of a co-ordinated
national campaign for a more significant increase later in
the year.<p>

<p>At the same time, he said, Lincoln members only
reluctantly accepted the offer as it falls far short of what
is necessary to make up for a decade of salary erosion.<p>

<p>"Academic staff have, in the strongest possible terms,
called on Lincoln's Vice-Chancellor and Council to increase
their efforts to persuade the government to implement real
increases for university resources and staff salaries," he
said. "And we call directly upon the Government to address
the underfunding of universities in a way that ensures staff
do not continue to bear the cost of that declining
funding."</p>
