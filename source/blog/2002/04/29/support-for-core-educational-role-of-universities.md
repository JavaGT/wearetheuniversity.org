University Staff (AUS) has restated its support for the core
educational role of the university in the liberal arts and
fundamental sciences.</p><p>The Government is currently
conducting a strategic review of the tertiary education
system and its funding framework. Within that context, the
National President of the AUS, Dr Grant Duncan, said that
“the case in favour of a liberal education in the arts and
humanities or in the natural and social sciences has never
been stronger.”</p><p>He noted, however, that many students feel
forced or obliged to undertake courses of study that have a
narrowly vocational purpose, such as law, business or
engineering.</p><p>“Each student”, he said, “should be supported
in following his or her interests and passions. It is much
better for a person’s development to perform well in the
completion of, say, an arts degree than to drag oneself
reluctantly through a business degree.”</p><p>Many universities
overseas are now placing greater emphasis on learning
outcomes like critical thinking, aesthetic and ethical
awareness, cultural and creative capabilities,
communication, and civic responsibility. And widespread
knowledge of the basic sciences will be increasingly
important for a nation’s participation in future economic
innovation.</p><p>Dr Duncan commented that “it is pleasing to
see that so many educators and employers are recognising the
renewed significance and value of the traditional types of
liberal education provided by the universities.”

<p>He noted
that the new legislation would continue to require
universities to provide an advanced education that promotes
intellectual independence and that is closely linked to
research. Universities would continue to be repositories of
knowledge and to act as a critic and conscience of
society.</p><p></p><p>Contact numbers for Dr Grant Duncan:		021 680
