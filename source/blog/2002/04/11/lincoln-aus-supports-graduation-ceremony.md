<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Lincoln Association
of University Staff [AUS] will have a presence at the
<br>Lincoln University Graduation this Friday (April 12),
according to Branch <br>Vice-President Walt Abell.<p>

<p>"We
will have a table and display in the main foyer with
messages of <br>congratulation to the graduands but we will
also have leaflets and posters <br>warning about the
desperate underfunding of universities by the
<br>government",  he said.<p>

<p>The AUS Lincoln branch
originally considered making a more formal protest
<br>outside the graduation venue but opted for a lower key
approach.  "Many of <br>our members are committed to
participating in the graduation and not just <br>by sitting
on stage. Quite a few are acting as ushers and marshalls, 
jobs <br>which are crucial to the smooth running of the
ceremony", said Mr Abell.<p>

<p>"I think that the high
participation of staff at the graduation and the
<br>constructive way that they are expressing concerns about
university <br>funding demonstrates the commitment of
Lincoln staff to the students," he <br>added.<p>

<p>Lincoln
AUS members are still in negotiations with the university
over<br>a new employment contract.<p>
