<p>“Overall Resourcing” Of Tertiary
Education Must Be Addressed</p>

<p>The Association of University
Staff [AUS] has welcomed aspects of the Government’s
response to the Education and Science Select Committee’s
report on the student loan scheme and the overall resourcing
of tertiary education.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr Grant
Duncan, said, ‘It is encouraging to hear that the government
wishes to ease the financial burden of the loans scheme.
However, the Government’s response concentrates only on
student support and fails to address the issue of ‘overall
resourcing’.<p>

<p>‘The question of student loans cannot be
considered in isolation from the question of university
funding as a whole,’ Dr Duncan said. ‘Student loans threaten
to become one of the major political and social issues of
the future, and the matter must be addressed. But, in
addition to this, the threats to the quality of university
education have the potential to undermine New Zealand’s
place in the future global economy and society.’</p>

<p>He warned
that, without considerable new public funding of the system,
the international standing of New Zealand’s universities,
and their ability to provide students with a high-quality
education, were under threat.</p>

<p>‘Government has gone about
as far as it can in bleeding students dry and putting them
into hock. But it has also gone too far in forcing
university staff to pay for the ongoing shortfalls in
funding through increased staff-student ratios and
reductions in the real value of their salary scales,’ said
Dr Duncan. ‘It’s high time the government substantially
increased its investment in the quality of university
education. Making university education more financially
viable for students is only one side of the coin.’</p>

<p>AUS has
called on the government to implement a funding mechanism
that enhances collaboration between tertiary education
institutions and provides a substantially increased quantity
of funding as an investment in New Zealand’s future
generations.</p>

<p>Staff at six universities will be taking
strike action on 4 March, in response to inadequate pay
offers from their employers.<p>
