selection of Vice-Chancellors</p><p>The Association of
University Staff [AUS] has called on university councils to
ensure that future selection processes for the position of
Vice-Chancellor be conducted in a manner that is open to
scrutiny by, and feedback from, all university staff,
students and the public.</p><p>AUS National President, Dr Grant
Duncan, reminded councils that the unique character of the
university resides in its ideal of an open, unconditional
and contestable pursuit of knowledge, based upon free
collegial investigation, debate and inquiry.</p><p>‘The person
who has the privilege to occupy the position of
Vice-Chancellor is entrusted with upholding these principles
of the contemporary university. A university is not like
other public-sector organisations, and it is certainly not a
commercial enterprise. </p><p>Any applicant for the post of
Vice-Chancellor who insists on absolute confidentiality
during the selection process, or who refuses to be presented
to the university community as a candidate, has effectively
declared him- or herself unworthy of the job.’</p><p>Dr Duncan’s
comments were directed at future selection processes
expected to occur in New Zealand
universities.</p><p></p><p><br>Contact<br>Dr Grant Duncan<br>021 680
