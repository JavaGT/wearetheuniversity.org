staff<br>Freezing fees a palliative measure</p><p><br>The
Association of University Staff [AUS] has welcomed the news
that three university councils have agreed to freeze student
fees for 2003, but has warned that the 4.5 per cent increase
in public funding that they will receive in return is
inadequate.</p><p>“The 4.5 per cent increase in the
Government’s contribution, with no increase in student fees,
means the actual increase in university income is
significantly less than 4.5 per cent,” said Dr Grant Duncan,
AUS National President. “That hardly keeps up with inflation
– so that university funding effectively stands still. It
certainly does nothing to restore the drastic cuts in
university funding experienced during the 1990s.”</p><p>“There
will be no highly-skilled, knowledge-based economy for the
future, unless this Government is prepared to tackle the
fundamental problem faced by New Zealand’s university system
– which in terms of real Government funding, experienced, on
average, annual reductions of 2.8% each year during the
1990s”.</p><p>“We are all for reducing the personal cost of
studying at university,” said Dr Duncan. “But this must not
be at the expense of university staff and the quality of
university education. A substantial injection of additional
Government funding for our universities is urgently needed
and until this is recognised, the current policy of freezing
fees must be seen as a very limited palliative
measure.”</p><p></p><p>Contact</p><p>Dr Grant Duncan,  National
