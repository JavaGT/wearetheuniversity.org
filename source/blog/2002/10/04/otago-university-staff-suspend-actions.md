<p>OTAGO
UNIVERSITY STAFF SUSPEND ACTIONS IN HOPE OF IMPROVED OFFER
AFTER TUESDAY’S COUNCIL</p>

<p>Academic and General Staff at the
University of Otago have agreed to suspend rolling stoppages
and the imposition of work to rule until after the
University Council meets on Tuesday afternoon, 8 October.<p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Graeme Fogelberg, has signalled
that he is not prepared to negotiate further until after
that meeting.  As a gesture of goodwill and as an assurance
to Council members that the unions wish to continue talks,
all actions except the withholding of financial reports have
been suspended through to Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Dr. Shef
Rogers, the combined unions’ spokesperson, indicated that
rolling stoppages over the past two weeks had clearly caused
difficulties for the university management.  “We have no
desire to harm the university’s reputation or its functions,
and wish to return to meaningful discussions as soon as
possible.”<p>

<p>Union members will be asked to join Council
members for a brown bag lunch on the Registry lawn at 1 pm
on Tuesday, and to attend the public section of the Council
meeting starting at 2:15.<p>

<p>“We think,” reported Dr.
Rogers, “that both sides understand the issues and recognise
that this dispute needs to move toward settlement.  We hope
that the Council and the Vice-Chancellor can agree on a new
offer that will see all of us back in discussions quickly,
in line with the Senate resolutions passed last
week.”</p>
