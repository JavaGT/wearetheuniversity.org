University Staff (AUS) has enthusiastically welcomed
Government’s announcement of an innovation strategy in the
Prime Minister’s statement to Parliament yesterday.</p><p>AUS
National President, Dr Grant Duncan, says it is particularly
pleasing to note the inclusion of tertiary education policy
and strong investment in education as key elements in the
Prime Minister’s speech.</p><p>“The work of the Tertiary
Education Commission has set a challenging agenda for
policy-makers and for the universities over the coming year.
</p><p>“The talents and contributions of university staff to
education and research are being recognised as a vital
component in the development of a strong and innovative
economy,” he said.</p><p>The AUS also welcomed the inclusion of
the creative industries as one of the sectors singled out
for economic development. </p><p>Dr Duncan commented that this
indicates that the present government values the arts and
humanities. He hoped this would translate into strong
support for research and scholarship in areas such as New
Zealand literature, film studies and history.</p><p>But while
the Prime Minister claimed that her government had reduced
the cost of tertiary education for students, she gave no
indication of how much extra financial support the
universities could expect, he said.</p><p>“The government’s
stated commitment to innovation and education will need to
be matched by a financial commitment to increase our
national investment in tertiary education.”

<p>Government
support per equivalent full-time student in university
education had fallen by 39% in real terms between 1980 and
1999; and the present government, while putting a freeze on
the costs of student fees, has barely kept university
funding in pace with inflation.</p><p>‘We sincerely hope’, said
Dr Duncan, ‘that the Prime Minister’s latest comments will
be followed through by real reinvestment in university
education and research in this year’s Budget.”</p><p></p><p>AUS
