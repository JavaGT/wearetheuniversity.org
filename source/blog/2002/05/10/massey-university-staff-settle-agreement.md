<p><br>Massey Collective
Agreement Settled</p>

<p>Massey union members have voted
overwhelmingly this week to ratify the latest employer
offer.  Key aspects of the settlement include a 3.5% salary
increase backdated to the first pay period in January,
improvements to the position of Massey staff who work on a
temporary or casual basis, improvements to the sick leave
and study provisions, an undertaking to address important
workload issues outside of the agreement and most
significantly a recognition of the importance of collective
bargaining.  The Agreement expires in October 2002 and
negotiations recommence in September this year.</p>

<p>"We are
pleased that union members are so united in their decision
to settle this long-running dispute.  We certainly would not
have seen this level of support if the employer had not made
significant concessions to union members.  Our unity
throughout this process has been remarkable and obviously
effective" said Combined Union Spokesperson Peter
Blakey.</p>

<p>"One of the most noteworthy and important aspects
to this year's settlement is that the employer has
recognised the importance of our collective bargaining
process.  We have reached an agreement where the union
negotiated settlement will not automatically be passed on to
non-union staff.  This has already put a message into the
Massey community that bargaining collectively will achieve
improvements and that if you choose not to be part of that
you take your chances.  I think we have managed to
demonstrate to staff that there are clear and tangible
benefits to being part of our unions.  This aspect of our
settlement puts us in a strong position for future
bargaining" said Combined Union Spokesperson Jan
McPherson.<p>
<p>"Union members, however, are still dissatisfied
with the employer's salary offer.  At 3.5% it remains
inadequate to address the ongoing problems Massey faces when
recruiting and trying to retain well-qualified and highly
valuable staff.  We also note that the university has just
announced a $15 million surplus, which is more than they
budgeted for. We look forward to raising with them the best
way to spend this when negotiations recommence in September
this year" said Peter Blakey.</p>

<p>"A crucial aspect to
establishing a sense of trust and goodwill between our
unions and the employer, as we move towards further
negotiations in September, will be the work of the joint
union/employer salary and workload taskforces.  It will be
vital that these taskforces generate tangible and successful
outcomes, within the short timeframes that we have, which
union members can see and appreciate" said Jan
McPherson.</p>
