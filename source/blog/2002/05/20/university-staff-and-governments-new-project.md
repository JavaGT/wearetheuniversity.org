2002 <br>Attention Education Reporters</p><p><br>University
staff want broad staffing issues included in Government’s
new project</p><p>The Association of University Staff [AUS] has
called for a range of staffing issues to be included in the
Government’s recently announced Collaborating for Efficiency
project, the focus of which is: to gain efficiencies through
diagnosing and sharing best practice throughout the public
tertiary education sector. </p><p>AUS National President, Dr
Grant Duncan, stressed that he hoped that the project did
not mean a continuation of the negative policies of the
1990s, which emphasised ‘efficiency’ requirements more
relevant to profit-focused private business than to public
education institutions.</p><p>Dr Duncan noted that the stated
emphasis of the project was on developing collaborative
strategies across the sector and that one of the focus areas
for the project would be ‘staffing costs’. </p><p>‘The public
education sector would benefit enormously, not least in
terms of efficiency and effectiveness, from the development
of collaborative strategies related to staffing issues,’
said Dr Duncan. ‘Moving towards more collaboration in
industrial relations would be a good start -  instead of
each individual institution spending scarce resources, time
and energy duplicating activity in this area’.</p><p>‘A good
example of the potential for collaboration is the
development of job evaluation schemes in the universities,’
continued Dr Duncan. ‘Currently, each institution, at great
cost, employs consultants and devotes significant resources
to developing its own job evaluation scheme. Given that each
institution employs the same occupational groups, it seems
logical to suggest that a common, national scheme would be
more appropriate – and a better use of resources that are
urgently needed elsewhere in the system.’</p><p>Dr Duncan said
that AUS would be approaching the Government regarding union
representation on the steering group now being established
to oversee the work of the new project.</p><p><br>Contact:<br>Dr
