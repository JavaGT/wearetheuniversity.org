to this special Budget edition of AUS Tertiary Update</a></p><p><a href="http://www.aus.ac.nz ">KEY
BUDGET POINTS FOR UNIVERSITIES<br>The main points of
interest for the university sector in this year's Budget
include:<br>„h A 4.5% increase in the level of government
tuition subsidy for those institutions that agree to
maintain student fees at 2000 levels<br>„h An Integrated
Funding Formula (IFF) with the following components:<br>1. A
student component to replace the Universal Tertiary Tuition
Allowance or EFTS system. This will have a performance-based
component built in.<br>2. A research component distributed
through the Performance-Based Research Fund. The criteria
for this will be based on output as well as peer assessment
of researchers.<br>3. A Strategic Development Fund.<br>„h
The Tertiary Education Commission, which will monitor
institutions and allocate funding, will be established on 1
July 2002.<br>„h Regulations will enable government to
prescribe maximums for fees with effect from the 2004
academic year.<br>„h Three-year funding will be introduced. 
Its introduction will be staggered.<br>„h A funding category
review will be undertaken, to ensure that funding is aligned
with strategic priorities.<br>„h Funding for Private
Training Establishments (PTEs) will be capped next year at
$146 million, and the PTE Student Component will not include
the nominal 9.5% for capital costs available to public
institutions.  This is in recognition of government¡¦s role
in funding capital investment in the public sector.

<p>Comment on the Budget from the university
sector</p><p>UNIVERSITY STAFF SEE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS <br>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) says the new funding
formula to be introduced from 2004 is a profound change and
hopes it will mark a turning point for tertiary education in
New Zealand.  AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan, says
that while there is not a lot of new funding being invested
in the sector in 2003, some of the results of the lengthy
reform process are now starting to show through. "We¡¦re
hopeful that the future developments for university funding
revealed in this Budget will assist universities and their
staff to develop more fully their capabilities and to
contribute their best to our society," he says.  Highlights
of the Budget for university staff include the emphasis
placed on quality and research productivity rather than just
student numbers in determining future funding levels ¡V an
improvement, the union says, on the "bums on seats" funding
model of the past.  It also welcomes the introduction of
mechanisms to align funding with strategic priorities as
well as the shift to giving public institutions priority in
public funding. Until now, private training establishments
have been funded in the same way as public institutions,
without taking account of some of the special
responsibilities of the public sector.  The result was a
huge flow of funds from the public-sector into a relatively
unregulated private sector.  Dr Duncan also sees the
government¡¦s Skills Forecasting Plan as a positive
development and emphasised the need to apply this to the
university workforce.<br>While welcoming the general tenor
of the Budget, Dr Duncan says there is also room for
caution. "There are still a lot of unanswered questions
about the details of the proposed funding formula, and AUS
looks forward to contributing constructively to its
development."  That included contributing to the monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms that will be used by the Tertiary
Education Commission when it begins operations in a little
over a month's time. "It is imperative that genuine and
effective partnerships be established with the sector to
determine critical issues such as how to evaluate teaching
quality and research excellence," Dr Duncan says. "The worst
outcome would be to end up with a bureaucratic model that
does not reflect the sector¡¦s capabilities and
values."<br>AUS also has reservations about the potential
impact of the Performance-based Research Fund, especially on
academics who are in the early stages of their career and
who may find it difficult to initiate research projects
while managing high teaching workloads. Women academics have
also been disadvantaged by similar schemes in other
countries.</p><p>SECTOR STILL NEEDS MORE MONEY<br>On funding
levels, AUS says the 4.5% increase in the government subsidy
per student announced yesterday is a small improvement, but
not enough.  There is still a long way to go to even return
to the funding levels of the early 1990s. When the effect of
the fees freeze is taken into account, AUS says the net gain
for universities is only 3% and the figure barely makes an
impact when inflation forecasts of 1.7% to 2.5% are taken
into account.  Dr Duncan says the increase also goes no way
towards making up the funding cuts of the 1990s.  "Whatever
good ideas this Budget may introduce", he says, "the
universities will not be able to deliver their best without
significantly increased reinvestment.  If the government can
muster the resources and the foresight to deliver
substantial new funding to the sector, then it will have
real social, cultural and economic pay-offs in the future." 
AUS has estimated that it would take cumulative annual
increases of 12% in the government¡¦s tuition subsidy over
three years to make any real progress in rebuilding
institutional capacity and bringing investment in the
universities and their staff up to internationally
comparable levels.</p><p>BRIGHTER OUTLOOK FOR SALARIES
POST-BUDGET<br>Even though the level of funding is not
enough to replenish university coffers after more than a
decade of underfunding, AUS believes the 4.5% increase
announced in the Budget is an improvement on the last two
years.  It should allow management to produce better salary
offers when negotiations resume later this year in most
universities, allowing staff to recoup some of the losses of
the 1990s.  The last round of negotiations for the 2002 year
resulted in settlements that were mostly in the 3% to 4%
range.<br>AUS also believes the trend towards centralised
control of university funding through regulations to cap
student fees should result in salary settlements being
pre-determined as well.  The government proposes introducing
the fees cap in 2004, taking away from university councils
any discretion in setting fees.  Dr Duncan says the
government may now just as well regulate for a more
collaborative mechanism to set university staff salaries
nationwide rather than on a institution-by-institution basis
as happens now.  "The removal of discretion from university
councils and managers effectively means that the employers¡¦
ability to pay for salary increases is determined from the
centre," he says. "If government wants the capability to
¡¥steer¡¦ the sector from the centre, then it will not be
able to avoid steering the salary-setting process. After
all, salaries are the biggest budget item for universities."
AUS supports the idea of a national collective agreement and
a more centralised bargaining process for university
salaries, but to date the government has refused to discuss
the idea.
