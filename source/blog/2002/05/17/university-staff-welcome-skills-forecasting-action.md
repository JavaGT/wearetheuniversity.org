<p>University staff
welcome skills forecasting action plan</p>

<p><br>The Association
of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government’s
pre-Budget announcement of $11.6m for a skills forecasting
action plan. ‘AUS has lobbied for such an approach to
labour-market information consistently over the last
decade,’ said AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan.</p>

<p>Dr
Duncan stressed that New Zealand’s university workforce, a
key source of education and training for the nation’s wider
workforce, urgently requires forecasting analysis. ‘The
demographic student ‘bulge’ currently moving through the
school sector will reach our tertiary institutions within
this decade,’ said Dr Duncan. ‘At the same time our academic
workforce is set for a wave of retirements – this is also
occurring in countries from which New Zealand draws a
significant proportion of its academic workforce.
Additionally, salaries are not high enough to retain the
best people, and loans and debt are discouraging young
talented students from completing the higher degrees needed
for academic jobs.’</p>

<p>Dr Duncan stated that better
information about future labour-market needs is essential
for long-term human-resources strategies and provision in
the university sector.</p>

<p>He emphasised, however, that
because it takes 3 to 5 years or more for a university
student to graduate and become available for employment, the
universities could not be expected to respond rapidly to
short-term skills shortages.<p>
<p>‘A university education
provides a broad, generic and critical approach to life-long
learning. It develops the person for participation in
society and employment in a variety of ways,’ said Dr
Duncan.</p>

<p>‘The link between vocational skills and higher
education needs to be viewed in a wider context. Many
remarkable and creative careers have begun from educational
backgrounds that may not appear to be immediately relevant
to later achievements.’</p>
