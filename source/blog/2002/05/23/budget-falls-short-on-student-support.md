University Students Association has welcomed today’s budget
announcement of a 4.5% increase in student funding for the
next year, but believes the government has much more to do
in relieving the debt burden for students.</p><p> “While we are
elated that the era of massive annual tuition fee increases
appears to be over, we had hoped that this budget would see
some real movement towards a fairer allowance system,” said
AUSA Education Vice-President, Stephanie Thompson. </p><p>“It is
extremely disappointing that the government has not made any
moves towards lowering the age of independence from 25, nor
has there been an increase in the parental income levels
since the scheme’s inception,” said Ms Thompson.</p><p>“Only
through increasing access to allowances and lowering tuition
fees can the government hope to make any real decreases in
student debt,” concluded Ms Thompson.</p><p></p><p>ENDS</p><p></p><p>For
