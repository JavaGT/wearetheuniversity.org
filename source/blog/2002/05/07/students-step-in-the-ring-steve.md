         07 May 02</p><p>Auckland University Students are furious over
proposed government changes to the student loan scheme.
</p><p>“While we think it is important that the government
addresses the problem of escalating student loans, the
proposed solutions are not what students had in mind,” said
Auckland University Students Association Education
Vice-President, Stephanie Thompson.</p><p>“We believe that the
best way to reduce student debt is through greater access to
allowances, reductions in tuition fees, as well as a scheme
for writing off debt for graduates,” said Ms Thompson.</p><p>
“We will look forward to debating these issues with the
Minister when the plans finally become public,” concluded Ms
Thompson.</p><p>ENDS<br>
