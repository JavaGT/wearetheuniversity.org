<p>University
staff say ‘No’ to Heretaunga Campus</p>

<p>The Association of
University Staff [AUS] has expressed objections to the
proposal to lease the Heretaunga Campus in Upper Hutt to
Campus Group Holdings as a facility for the education of
international students.</p>

<p>Campus Group Holdings [CGH]
already has a joint operation with Central Queensland
University to recruit and train international students on
campuses in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji and
Australia, with fees in the range of Aus$10,000 –14,000 for
a full-time course per year.  Dr Grant Duncan, National
President of AUS, fears that the arrival of CGH will mean an
emphasis on providing pre-packaged courses which employ
staff on high workloads with no research component and with
frequent use of casual labour.</p>

<p>AUS sees this kind of
development as the ‘leading edge’ of low-quality, private,
globalised educational operations – with profits going
offshore. “We’ve been warning the government for some time
about the hazards of promoting global free trade in
educational services. It will lead to poor quality, and this
has the potential to reflect on New Zealand’s overall
reputation in higher education,” said Dr Duncan.</p>

<p>“Current
Government policy domestically is to move away from the free
market in our tertiary education system.  In contrast, it
seems intent on ensuring that the international tertiary
education free market will be able to flourish in New
Zealand.”<p>
<p>“This has negative implications for the
nation-building role of public tertiary education and for
the retention of a distinctive New Zealand education
system,” said Dr Duncan.<p>

<p>AUS is also unconvinced by the
Minister’s assurance that CGH would not be eligible for
public funding, as there appears to be no bar to any
provider applying to the Tertiary Education Commission for
public funding if they should decide to begin recruiting
domestic students in future years.</p>
