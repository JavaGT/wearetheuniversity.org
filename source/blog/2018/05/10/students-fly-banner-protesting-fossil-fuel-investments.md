	 <p>
         This morning, a group of students dropped an 8-meter banner
reading: "Your Uni is funding climate change. VC Stuart
McCutcheon divest now" from the University of Auckland
General Library. The banner is protesting the continued
refusal by University Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon to
call on the University Foundation to divest from coal, oil
and gas companies</p><p>“Climate change is an emergency for
humanity and we’re committed to pressuring Stuart
McCutcheon and the university to do the right thing.” said
Ben Martelli, Fossil Free University of Auckland
spokesperson. </p><p>The protest marks a year since Auckland
Council voted to divest from fossil fuels. In contrast,
Fossil Free UoA estimates that the University Foundation
currently has more than $5 million invested in coal, oil and
gas companies.</p><p>Today also serves as a reminder of growing
concern from students, regarding University conduct. Little
over a week ago, roughly 1000 students rallied to protest
the closure of five libraries, the move seen by many as an
attack on the arts and humanities.</p><p>"It’s worrying that
the university is acting in complete opposition to student
sentiment, but students will not be silenced.”</p><p>This
morning's protest is part of a continued effort by the group
who have been campaigning on the issue for over three years.
In 2017 the group staged an occupation of the
Vice-Chancellors wing of the Universities Clocktower
building.  Similarly, last year two hundred and forty
University of Auckland staff signed an open letter urging
the University Foundation to divest from coal, oil and gas.

<p>“We are committed to continued pressure on the Vice
Chancellor for as long as this university is invested in
coal, oil and gas” said Martelli.</p><p>"At a time when the
effects of climate change are now clearly being felt, it's
absurd that the University of Auckland remains in the dark
ages, invested in fossil fuels."</p><p>This action comes in the
same week that American environmentalist, author and
journalist, and co-founder of 350.org, Bill McKibben was in New
Zealand for his Global Fossil Free Acceleration Tour. The
Fossil Free UoA group operates under the umbrella of 350
Aotearoa. Together the groups are part of a global movement
that has led to institutions representing over $5 trillion
in assets divesting from fossil fuels. Notably in New
Zealand, those institutions include the University of Otago
and Victoria University of Wellington, and Auckland Council.
</p><p>Mr McKibben met personally with members of the group
earlier in the week offering his support of their
efforts.</p><p>ENDS.</p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
