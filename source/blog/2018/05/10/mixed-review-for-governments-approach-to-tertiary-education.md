<p><br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o
Aotearoa</p>

<p><strong>Good, but could do better. That’s
the verdict of the Tertiary Education Union after six months
of government efforts to reform the tertiary education
sector.</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>Launching a scorecard of the Minister for
Education Chris Hipkins’ performance, the TEU said
there have been hugely positive steps towards recognising
the benefits public tertiary education brings to us all. Two
examples in particular stand in stark contrast to the
disastrous market-based approach of the last National
government. The first is the passing of a tertiary education
bill with the changes thousands of students and staff told
the government to make. Second is Chris Hipkins’ ambitious
Education Work Plan, with its commitment to an inclusive,
public education system.</p>

<p>Positive steps have also been
taken to end competitive funding to levels 1 – 4. However
the Minister has fallen short of offering a long-term plan
to change the funding model, despite TEU evidence showing the sector
is woefully underfunded. There have also been moves to give
students and staff a greater say in decisions affecting
their places of study and work. TEU’s strongest criticism
focuses on the recent Cabinet Paper in which the Minister
said he wanted to see working conditions at Institutes of
Technology and Polytechnics renegotiated so staff can be
“used more efficiently”. Whilst, on Friday, at the TEU
conference, the Minister did back down from this statement,
he needs to go further and make a clear statement that a
Labour-led government will not pursue reforms that would
undermine working conditions in the tertiary education
sector.<p>

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the Tertiary
Education Union, said: <strong>“Chris Hipkins’ genuine
attempt to rebuild our public tertiary education sector has
been a welcome relief from nine years of National.
Unfortunately his efforts have been scuppered at times by
some poorly thought through proposals – not least that
Cabinet Paper, where the government effectively said it
wanted to interfere in collective bargaining - and not
involving students and staff in conversations about the
future of the sector.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“That said we are
seeing positive steps being taken. Rebuilding an accessible,
inclusive and equitable tertiary education sector that works
for all will require some bold decisions – some of which
may not be popular with those that got used to National’s
way of doing things. We are ready to support the Prime
Minister and Minister Hipkins in standing up to these
interests so they can take the bold steps we
need.”</strong><strong></strong></p>
