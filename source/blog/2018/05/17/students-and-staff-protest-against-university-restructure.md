<p>Today at 12pm students and staff
will protest the closure of specialist libraries, job
losses, and lack of public funding for tertiary education.
In response to the failures of university managers and
government ministers, they will demand a new democratic
university.</p>

<p>“The University of Auckland is implementing
another wave of restructures that will lead to unjustified
job losses, reduced support services, and the destruction of
critical learning spaces,” says A New
University.</p>

<p>“This new project for restructuring and
cutting library services, student learning services, IT and
finance signals further erosion of the quality of education
and conditions for staff and students.</p>

<p>“There have been
a wave of protests against the closure of specialist
libraries, including an occupation of the Fine Arts Library
until police were called on the occupiers. Students are now
fighting for more than the libraries, they want a new
university.</p>

<p>“Universities serve a vital role in acting
as a critic and conscience of society. This restructure
undermines that fundamental role.</p>

<p>“University funding
has been in steady decline for decades which has caused harm
to students and staff.</p>

<p>“With the increased costs of
living and unaffordable rental markets, students are falling
further into hardship.</p>

<p>“The Labour government’s
commitment to the Budget Responsibility Rules limits the
funding available for public services.</p>

<p>“Students call
for the Government to scrap this unnecessary financial
chokehold and fund education, housing and welfare.<p>
<p>“The
University of Auckland is controlled by highly paid senior
managers that make top-down decisions about how funding and
resources are allocated, bypassing consultation requirements
and refusing to engage with students and staff as
stakeholders in the institution.</p>

<p>“Stuart McCutcheon, one
of the highest paid public servants, has repeatedly
spearheaded restructuring processes without consulting staff
and students.</p>

<p>“Students call for the immediate
resignation of and the establishment of democratic decision
making processes at the University of
Auckland.</p>

<p>“Students and staff should have control over
how their place of work and learning are
managed.</p>

<p>“Education is not a business. Students demand A
New University under collective democratic
control.”</p>
