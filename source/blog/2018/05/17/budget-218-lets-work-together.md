<p>Students are applauding less debt as a result of the
Government’s fees-free policy, but say that student issues
do not end there. Student loan borrowing is $151 million
lower in the first three months of this year compared to
same period last year according to the Budget announced
today.</p>

<p>‘That’s $151 million less going towards the $16
billion national student loan balance,’ says Jonathan Gee,
National President of the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations (NZUSA).</p>

<p>‘However, fees-free alone will not
solve all the challenges that students face. Our vision
aligns with the Education Minister’s -- a barrier-free
education for all. Our message to the Minister is therefore
-- let’s work together.’</p>

<p>‘The Government is on the
right track, but they need to work with us and show us their
plan to genuinely create a barrier-free education for all
New Zealanders.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s not forget that during the
2017 general election, this Government promised to restore
postgraduate student allowances and restore student loan
borrowing for those studying long courses beyond 7 years of
study. We’re also eagerly awaiting free counselling for
under-25 year olds, as promised in the Labour/Greens
Confidence and Supply Agreement. The least we expect is for
those promises to be kept before we go to the polls
again.’</p>

<p>Gee says that the sector will be watching next
year’s Budget very closely.</p>

<p>‘In the face of course
cuts, staff cuts and cuts to the humanities, the tertiary
education sector is in need of a long-overdue funding boost.
Better still, we need to change the funding model to ensure
tertiary institutions are well-equipped to deliver a
tertiary education that is good for students and good for
New Zealand.’</p>
