<p>Budget forgets that tertiary education is the foundation of
the future  </p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s aspiration
that this Budget provides a foundation for the future has
been dealt a severe blow by the failure to invest further in
tertiary education.</p>

<p>Aspects of the Budget welcomed by the
Tertiary Education Union include the commitment to build
more houses, extend low cost GP visits, invest in rebuilding
the health system, and ensure we have enough teachers to
inspire our kids. However, the TEU has been left wondering
how it is possible to meet these commitments without a fully
funded, accessible tertiary education sector. </p>

<p>People
working in the tertiary sector are the foundation of the
future. They are the people that train the future builders
we need to build the new homes the government is committed
to, the GPs that will now be made more accessible, and the
nurses, midwives, teachers and social workers who will also,
rightly, be supported by this Budget. However, the reality
is that these commitments have been put at risk because of
the Finance Minister’s failure to address the $3.7 billion
funding hole the tertiary education sector faces – a hole
that will be made even worse through the Budget's failure
even to offer an inflation-linked funding increase. The TEU
is calling on the Minister for Education to urgently come
forward with a plan to work with the sector to change the
tertiary education funding model over the next 12 months, so
that next year’s Budget does provide a genuine foundation
for the future. 
</p>

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the
Tertiary Education Union, said: “The Prime Minister has
spoken about this being a Budget for the next generation,
and the tertiary education sector is absolutely critical to
meeting her commitment. Houses cannot be built without
trained builders, people cannot visit a GP without trained
doctors, kids cannot be taught without trained teachers, and
children cannot be supported without trained social workers.
Tertiary education is what connects these vital professions
to the commitments in this Budget, and the better New
Zealand the Prime Minister is so passionate about. Yet the
sector seems to have been forgotten. </p>

<p>“Labour is at risk
of going into the next election having fulfilled its
commitment to provide one year of free tertiary education,
which we welcome, but little else that will ensure these
students actually have places to study in their local
communities. Labour needs something else to point to - so it
can say to the New Zealand public that it has brought about
genuine change and in doing so has ensured that we do have
the doctors, nurses, builders, social workers and teachers
we desperately need. The Minister needs to work with us to
make that
happen.”</p>
