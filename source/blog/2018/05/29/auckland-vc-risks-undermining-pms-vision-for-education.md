         <strong>University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Stuart
McCutcheon's proposal to cut staff from the Faculty of
Education risks worsening the chronic teacher shortage
facing New Zealand, the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) said
today.</strong></p><p>McCutcheon told staff this afternoon that
he proposed to cut 23.4 full-time equivalent jobs from the
university’s Faculty of Education and Social Work. The
proposal is justified on the basis that the Faculty had
fallen short of meeting an arbitrary performance measure.
Focusing on meeting these narrow performance measures has
diminished the contribution the University of Auckland could
instead be making to help the government address the teacher
shortage, the TEU said. It will also undermine Associate
Minister Tracey Martin’s commitment to increasing the
number of social workers we have to care for those most in
need. The cuts come at a time when the University of
Auckland posted a budget surplus of nearly $70 million,
which could easily be used to prevent these and future job
losses.</p><p>In a newsletter to staff shortly after the
government’s first Budget, McCutcheon cited government
efforts to reduce the financial barrier to education by
offering a year of free tertiary study as a reason to expect
more staffing cuts. The TEU said this should sound alarm
bells in Labour and trigger a rethink in how the Government
talks about the fees-free policy. The TEU cautioned that VCs
like McCutcheon could be trying to pitch students and staff
against one another by suggesting that the reason people are
losing their jobs is because students are being better
supported into education. Ministers need to take statements
like this extremely seriously and work to ensure VCs run
universities in the best interests of all New
Zealanders.

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the TEU,
said: <strong>“We have a chronic shortage of teachers, and
this is having a serious impact on our ability to give kids
the best possible learning experience at school. Ensuring
they get this experience is going to be a vital part of
rebuilding the tertiary education sector - because kids need
to feel ready to go on to do further study, and a positive
school experience is a crucial part of that. Our members
have also been trying to get their heads around why this is
happening now, when the university has such a large surplus
and the government is in the middle of reviewing how the
tertiary sector works.</strong></p><p><strong>“We have
welcomed government efforts to improve schooling, such as
scrapping national standards and reforming NCEA. And whilst
we know there are many reasons for the teacher shortage, the
Prime Minister’s efforts to address it certainly won’t
be helped by Stuart McCutcheon saying today that we wants to
cut back on the very people we need to train the teachers of
the future. Proposals like this do, of course, make us think
about the people affected and their families, but they also
provide further proof that narrow performance measures of
the past are broken. VCs must accept this and start working
with us to reform the sector. That way we can ensure the
universities they run are making the best possible
contribution to teaching people the knowledge and skills we
desperately need as a nation.”</strong></p><p>Alongside cuts
to the Faculty of Education, McCutcheon also announced today
a proposal to cut back the Faculty of Arts by around 11
full-time equivalent staff. The decision will impact on the
Schools of Culture, Languages and
Linguistics.</p><p><strong>“Securing New Zealand’s position
in the global economy will depend on our ability to
understand different cultures and to communicate in the
language of our partners.  Cutting back teaching in these
areas will make that much harder. It will also put at risk
the university’s reputation for delivering world-class
teaching in these areas,” </strong>Grey
added.</p><p><strong>--ENDS--</strong></p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
