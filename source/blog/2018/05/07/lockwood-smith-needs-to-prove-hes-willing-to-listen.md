         Lockwood Smith needs to prove he’s willing to listen to
students and staff</p><p><strong>Former National Education
Minister Sir Lockwood Smith needs to prove he is willing to
listen to a wide range of views from students and staff as
part of the Government’s Education Work Plan, the Tertiary
Education Union said today.</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Best
remembered for saddling a generation of students with
unmanageable debt through the introduction of
interest-bearing student loans, Smith was appointed by
current Education Minister Chris Hipkins’ to sit on a new
eight-member advisory group. The group has been tasked with providing
“coherence” between the ideas submitted through the
Prime Minister’s Education Conversation and the numerous
reviews the Government has triggered into most parts of the
education system.</p><p>Smith is a controversial choice given
the Government’s commitment to providing three years’
free tertiary education. He also introduced means testing on
allowances for students under 25 years, which snatched from
thousands of Kiwis the opportunity to have a tertiary
education. Smith’s first task in his new role will be to
prove he’s willing to listen to a range of perspectives to
ensure that any advice given to the Minister is in keeping
with the long-term commitment to free, accessible and
equitable tertiary education.

<p>Sandra Grey, national
president of the Tertiary Education Union, said:
<strong>“We were surprised to see Lockwood Smith’s name
appear on a list of people tasked with guiding the Minister
through reform of the education sector. It seems sensible to
try a cross-party approach to these changes, but we do
wonder whether having someone so clearly at odds with the
current Government’ approach – and who put in place
policies that demonstrably denied education opportunities to
thousands of Kiwis - is a wise choice. We hope to be proved
wrong, of course, so to help assuage our concerns Lockwood
Smith should state clearly that he is willing listen - and
that he will do nothing in this new role to undermine the
Government’s laudable commitment to free
education.”</strong></p><p>The advisory group will be led by
Judge Andrew Becroft, the Children’s Commissioner, and has
as its members: Sir Lockwood Smith, Marian Hobbs, Professor
Rawinia Higgins, Dr. Debbie Ryan, Dr, Welby Ings, Etta
Bollinger, and Deborah
Walker.</p><p><strong>--ENDS--</strong><strong></strong></p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
