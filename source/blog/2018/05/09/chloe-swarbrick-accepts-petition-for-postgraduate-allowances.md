for postgraduate allowances</p><p></p><center><img src="http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1805/8d45870993ddcee40b7b.jpeg" width="720" height="480"><br></center><p></p><center>NZUSA
National President Jonathan Gee (left) with Greens’
Education Spokesperson Chlöe Swarbrick MP<br></center><p>Students have found an ally in Chlöe Swarbrick, who
received a <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Four.actionstation.org.nz%2Fpetitions%2Frestore-the-postgraduate-student-allowance-now&amp;e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=chloe1&amp;n=1" target="_blank">petition</a> last night calling for the
urgent reinstatement of student allowances for postgraduate
students. The allowance was scrapped by the previous
Government in 2013.</p><p>The petition, created by the New
Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA), received
2159 signatures in little over a month.</p><p>‘During
our meeting, we passed onto Chlöe some stories from
students who have struggled through postgraduate study due
to the lack of an allowance. These are our future
psychologists, teachers and leaders – restoring the
allowance isn’t just good for them but good for the
country,’ says National President Jonathan Gee.</p><p>In
the 2017 general election, the Greens released their <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greens.org.nz%2Ffair-deal-for-students&amp;e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=chloe1&amp;n=2" target="_blank">student policy</a> which included allowances
for all postgraduate students. Universal postgraduate
allowances go one step further than Labour’s <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.labour.org.nz%2Ftertiaryeducation&amp;e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=chloe1&amp;n=3" target="_blank">tertiary education policy</a>, which simply
calls for postgraduate students to be eligible for
allowances, which are currently means-tested.</p><p>‘We’re pleased to have found an ally in Chlöe to
make education more accessible for all New Zealanders. Our
support is growing and we hope that the Education Minister
takes notice.’</p><p>‘Regardless of what happens in
the Government’s Budget announcement next week, we will
continue to fight to remove the barriers that students face
during tertiary study.’</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
