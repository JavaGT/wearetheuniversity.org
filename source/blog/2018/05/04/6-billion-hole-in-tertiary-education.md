         $6 billion hole risks plunging tertiary education into a
funding crisis</p><p><strong>Students could be left without
places to study in their local communities because of an
emerging $6 billion funding crisis, the Tertiary Education
Union (TEU) warned today.</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Treasury figures analysed by the TEU
show that cumulative underfunding to the sector reached $3.7
billion this year from 2009 levels. Based on current figures
the funding hole will increase to more than $6 billion over
the next three years. To meet the commitment Minister for
Education Chris Hipkins has made to all New Zealanders that
they will have access to quality lifelong learning
opportunities, Finance Minister Grant Robertson needs to use
the forthcoming Budget to set out a plan to increase annual
spending to tertiary education.</p><p>Funding to the tertiary
education sector was slashed by Simon Bridges’ friends in
the last National Government. Last year the sector was given
10 per cent less than it had in 2009, the year after
National took power. Funding cuts have far outpaced the drop in student numbers over the same
period. And the situation is only set to get worse as
cash-strapped institutions continue to look at ways to slash
costs to deal with the flawed approach of the previous
government, including cutting courses, and this year alone
instigating more than 130 reviews covering all aspects of
tertiary provision.

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the
Tertiary Education Union, said: <strong>“Tertiary
education is facing a ticking time bomb thanks to
National’s failure to give our vital public institutions
enough to meet the cost of training future builders,
mechanics, nurses, teachers, scientists. No wonder courses
have closed; regional teaching spaces have been shut down;
and arts and humanities programmes have been slashed. And no
wonder so many students are living in
poverty.</strong></p><p><strong>“As proud Kiwis we agree to
pool our resources for the benefit of us all – whether it
is money to run schools, to keep us healthy, to build roads
and houses, or to provide clean drinking water. Tertiary
education is no different. It is not a nice to have extra
– it is the teaching and training that connects our
children to their future, to jobs that we all depend
on.</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>“Chris Hipkins has
a big job to clean up the mess left by National, but that
cannot be an excuse to shirk the responsibility he has to
make our sector work. Starting at this year’s Budget, he
and Grant Robertson need to set out a plan about how we as a
nation pool our resources to rebuild an education sector
that is healthy, dynamic and meets the needs of students,
whānau, and communities, </strong>exactly as experts in the tertiary sector
have called
