         VCs at risk of opting out of government’s vision, Otago
uni cuts show</p><p>Vice-Chancellors need to accept that cutting
jobs to meet narrow performance metrics will do nothing to
help rebuild an inclusive tertiary education sector that
meets the needs of all New Zealanders, the Tertiary
Education Union said today.</p><p>The TEU is calling on
Vice-Chancellors to rethink the way they make decisions so
our public universities can better deliver for the benefit
of all New Zealanders. The call came after University of
Otago Vice-Chancellor Harlene Hayne this week handed letters
to 280 staff at the Dunedin campus advising how their job
has been impacted by a three year Support Services Review. The
review will see vital support services, including student
advice and support, removed from individual departments and
replaced by more standardised services delivered across the
whole institution. Hayne has said the plan was to cut 162
full time equivalent jobs.</p><p>Whereas some staff have been
given the option to be confirmed into other roles, the
number of voluntary redundancies to date is 118. This will
be reached in part by not renewing fixed-term employment
agreements, thus highlighting the precarious position
universities are knowingly putting staff in when they do not
offer permanent work. People set to lose their jobs are
those that provide vital support services that have helped
to build the university’s reputation for world class
teaching and research. With further cuts expected soon at
other universities, the government needs to start asking
itself if it can meet the commitments it has made when
Vice-Chancellors cut back in areas so vital to teaching and
learning. Cutting jobs to meet narrow performance metrics
risks diminishing the contribution universities can make to
teaching people the knowledge and skills we desperately
need.

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the TEU,
said:</p><p>“First and foremost, when job cuts are announced
we look at what the losses mean for the people affected and
their families, and we do everything we can as a union to
support them. There will be some difficult conversations
happening around dinner tables in Dunedin this week and I
hope these people will come to us with any questions or
concerns. But Professor Hayne’s decision to axe such a
large number of jobs also points to a need for
Vice-Chancellors to stop making decisions based on the
narrow market metrics of the last National Government. They
need to accept that the playing field has changed, so
let’s starting working together as a sector to make sure
our public institutions are providing a genuine foundation
for the future.”</p><p>Shaun Scott, organiser of the Tertiary
Education Union branch at the University, said:</p><p>“We know
how devastating it can be to lose a job and the stress and
worry it can impose on people and their families. Throughout
this review we have made clear that the changes university
management was seeking to make would have a negative impact
on the quality of service required to deliver high quality
teaching and learning; research and student support. It is
regrettable to find ourselves here but the TEU will do
everything it can to support the people affected. Even those
who have been reconfirmed into new roles face the
uncertainty of what their new job will entail, and where in
the university they will be
working.”</p><p>--ENDS--</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
