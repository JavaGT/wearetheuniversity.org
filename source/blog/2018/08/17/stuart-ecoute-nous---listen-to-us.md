<p>Stuart McCutcheon’s team has spent today telling people
working in the University of Auckland’s School of
Cultures, Languages and Linguistics that they may no longer
have a job. McCutcheon’s decision to axe 5.5 full-time
equivalent jobs, equal to 30 per cent of those working in
European languages, suggests he does not see a strong role
for the University of Auckland in making sure New Zealand
can take advantage of the huge opportunity and potential
that comes from being a country with an ever-increasing
number of diverse cultures and language speakers.</p>

<p>In July,
alongside cuts to the Faculty of Education and Social Work,
McCutcheon announced his intention to cut back the Faculty
of Arts by nearly 6 full-time equivalent staff, with the axe
falling incisively on European Languages within the School
of Cultures, Languages and Linguistics. Today, those whose
job has been sitting precariously under McCutcheon’s axe
for the last few months found out whether or not it will
fall on their role. Those set to lose their jobs now have
four weeks to provide feedback on the decision.</p>

<p>McCutcheon
has used narrow performance metrics to justify the cuts,
seemingly giving little consideration to the huge
contribution the study of languages and cultures make to
life in Aotearoa New Zealand. For a modern, outward looking
country like New Zealand, languages are an essential skill,
enabling individuals not only to succeed, but to participate
and engage constructively in political, social, cultural,
and economic life. Languages are not exclusively about
communication, they are imbued with ideologies, culture,
history and symbols. From celebrating the enormous
contribution Pasifika languages have made to life in New
Zealand, through to welcoming migrants from all around the
world, languages have shaped our modern lives.<p>

<p>Nanette
Cormack, Deputy Secretary of the Tertiary Education Union
(TEU), said: “Learning a language is about so much more
than being able to put our own words into a different
written and oral code. It means being able benefit from the
huge socio-cultural, as well as on the economic, potential
that infuses every language. It is simply not good enough to
cut jobs based on whether or not the School has met narrow
performance metrics. Understanding and advancing the role of
language and culture in society requires a much more mature,
nuanced approach. The future of language study and research
is far too complex to be reduced to a set of market-based
metrics that can be bent to Stuart McCutcheon’s will,
rather than towards meeting our needs as a
nation.</p>

<p>“Decisions like those made by Stuart McCutcheon
today always make think about the people affected and their
families. We will be doing everything we can as a union to
support those affected through the difficult weeks and
months ahead. But the decision also provides further proof
that the narrow performance metrics of the past are broken.
Vice-Chancellors everywhere must now accept this and start
working with us to reform the sector. That way we can ensure
the universities they run are making the best possible
contribution to ensuring we can take advantage of the huge
benefits learning subjects like a foreign language bring to
us
all.”</p>
