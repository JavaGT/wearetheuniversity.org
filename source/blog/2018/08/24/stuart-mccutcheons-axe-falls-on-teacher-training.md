         Stuart McCutcheon’s axe has fallen on the University of
Auckland’s Faculty of Education and Social Work after 21
staff were told this week that their jobs are on the line.
Echoing through the Beehive, McCutcheon’s axing of each
and every job will make it harder for Jacinda Ardern to
fulfil her commitment to end the chronic teacher shortage we
face.</p><p>Early in July , Stuart McCutcheon confirmed that he
wanted to cut 22.4 full-time equivalent jobs from the
university’s Faculty of Education and Social Work. After
months of uncertainty about their future, those set to lose
their jobs were told the news in one-on-one meetings
throughout this week.. They now have four weeks to provide
feedback on the decision. The timing of the decision is
inexplicable given that a lack of teachers is one of the
most pressing challenges New Zealand faces. For future
generations to fulfil their potential - whether as a social
worker, nurse, teacher, business owner — they need a great
education. We succeed as a nation only when we invest in our
teachers and their communities. The starting point for that
is making sure we are doing everything we can to train the
teachers, social workers and counsellors we need. Stuart
McCutcheon needs to take responsibility for what he has done
to make it harder for this Government to address the chronic
shortage of teachers and counsellors we face.</p><p>Thousands of
people in towns and cities all across New Zealand rightly
came together last Wednesday to call on the Education
Minister Chris Hipkins to increase the number of teachers.
Because of years of underfunding by the last National-led
Government, our education system is also falling short when
it comes to ensuring teachers’ pay and conditions reflect
the remarkable difference they make to Kiwi kids’ lives.
Every teacher, every child, every parent, uncle, aunty,
grandparent and friend that came out on Wednesday to show
their support for our incredible teachers proved just how
much our public education system matters to New
Zealanders.

<p>Nanette Cormack, Deputy Secretary of the
Tertiary Education Union (TEU), said:“Rebuilding the
tertiary education sector after years of neglect under
National starts with our youngest learners. Kids need feel
they are ready to go on to do further study, and a positive
school experience is a crucial part of that. Making sure we
have enough teachers to inspire our kids to pursue a life of
learning, and that the education system values these people
for what they do, is one of the best things we can do with
the money we all pool together through taxes. That’s one
of the reasons why it is so infuriating to see Stuart
McCutcheon cutting the jobs of the very people we need to
train the teachers of the future.</p><p>“We all agree to
contribute to the future of our public education system
because it’s the right thing to. Why can’t Stuart
McCutcheon do the same? It’s time he stood up and said he
will do what he can to help us address the teacher shortage
– for the good of all of us. The University of Auckland
recently posted a budget surplus of nearly $70 million, so
we know he can do it.
