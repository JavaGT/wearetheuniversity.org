<p>Minister, Stuart McCutcheon isn’t
making the teacher strike easy for you</p>

<p><strong>On today of
all days, it should not escape everyone’s notice that at
the same time teachers are standing together for an
education system that values and attracts new and incredible
people to teach our kids, the Vice-Chancellor of the
University of Auckland, Stuart McCutcheon is cutting the
jobs of the very people we need to train
them.</strong></p>

<p>People across New Zealand are rightly
calling on the Education Minister Chris Hipkins to increase
the number of teachers – and to ensure their pay and
conditions reflect the remarkable difference they make to
Kiwi kids’ lives. And yet, whilst this fantastic
collective effort to change our country for the better is
taking place, in an office in Auckland Stuart McCutcheon is
preparing to tell some of our most dedicated and valued
teacher educators that they no longer have a job. Back in
May, McCutcheon proposed to cut 23.4 full-time equivalent
jobs from the university’s Faculty of Education and Social
Work. This week he is expected to tell people working in the
Faculty whether they have lost their jobs or not.</p>

<p>Stuart
McCutcheon should be watching the thousands of people
standing together and be inspired to do what he can to help
Chris Hipkins address New Zealand’s chronic teacher
shortage, the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) said. Instead
he is focused on meeting narrow performance metrics that
bear no relation to the reality of what needs to be done to
get more teachers into the classroom. McCutcheon’s teacher
training cuts are also coming soon after the University of
Auckland posted a budget surplus of nearly $70 million -
evidence that we can afford to train more teachers so that
every child receives the education they need to
thrive.<p>

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the TEU, said:
<strong>“Stuart McCutcheon needs to take responsibility
for making it harder for this Government to address the
chronic shortage of teachers we face. We stand with every
one of our teacher colleagues and thank them for going to
extraordinary lengths to make sure our kids get the best
possible start to their learning journey. As teachers come
together today to look for answers to what can be done to
attract more people into the profession, decent pay and
conditions that reflect the remarkable commitment they have
to their jobs is of course one. But so too is making sure we
are doing everything we can to train the teachers we need.
It defies understanding that Stuart McCutcheon is making
this harder than it needs to be. It is time he threw out the
narrow performance metrics he is using to justify cutting
teacher training jobs, and start thinking about what he can
do to ensure more people enter the classroom with the skills
and knowledge they need to help Kiwi kids thrive. He needs
to do it for the good of our kids, for good of the whole
teaching profession, and for the good of the
country.”</strong></p>
