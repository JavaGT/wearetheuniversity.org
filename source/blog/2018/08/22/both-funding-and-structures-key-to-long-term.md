<p>The latest exploration of a partnership or merger
opportunity between two tertiary education institutions is
further evidence that we need to rethink the sector’s
funding system, the TEU said.</p>

<p>Lincoln University and the University of
Canterbury (UC) announced yesterday that they have
signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to explore
partnership or merger opportunities.</p>

<p>The
announcement from Lincoln’s vice chancellor, James McWha,
noted that the exploration of options was needed to address
issues facing the sectors, particularly around encouraging
more people to study and work in the land-based sectors,
increasing productivity and developing solutions to present
and future technological, social and environmental
challenges.</p>

<p>“The issues faced by Lincoln and other
small tertiary institutions cannot be addressed by simply
restructuring the way tertiary education institutions are
managed and organised,” says Sandra Grey, TEU National
President.</p>

<p>“Underfunding and poor policy decisions
over the last decade have meant that Lincoln University has
undergone almost constant restructuring and course closures.
This means we need to explore both the structural and
funding issues facing Lincoln University if we want to
ensure a stable and long-term future for those wanting to
teach, learn, and research there.”<br>The Government is committed to Lincoln
remaining at its present site and retaining its brand and
identity.   However, Grey notes that the last government
made similar promises about mergers and partnerships but
failed to deliver. “Past mergers in the tertiary education
sector have led to course closures, job cuts, and lost
opportunities for students, their families, and
communities.”</p>

<p>“We need a commitment to the
current levels of provision and to ensuring that the Lincoln
University and University of Canterbury leaders take
seriously staff and student voice. Those working and
learning at Lincoln who can offer expertise and experiences
that will ensure any merger or partnership is
successful.”</p>
