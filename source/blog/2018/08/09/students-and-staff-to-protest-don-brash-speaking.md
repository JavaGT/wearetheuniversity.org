         Students and Staff to protest Don Brash speaking at
University of Auckland </p><p><br>A New University has organised
a public protest opposing the inclusion of Don Brash in a
University of Auckland Debating Society event to be held on
campus on Thursday 9th August at 6.00pm in the Owen G Glenn
building.</p><p><br>“Since his infamous ‘Orewa Speech’ in
2004, Don Brash has remained a leading figure in
legitimating racial dog whistle politics in
Aotearoa.</p><p><br>“Brash has a long resume of anti-Māori
activity, including his involvement with the group
Hobson’s Pledge, his public dismissal of Māori wards on
councils, opposition to incorporating principles of the
Treaty into legislation and stating public broadcasting of
Te Reo ‘irritates the hell out of
[him]’.</p><p><br>“Brash’s haste to come to the defense of
far-right ideologues Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux
shows his commitment to the right to spread hate speech with
no consideration of the consequences for those targeted by
racial abuse and discrimination.</p><p><br>“Universities are
legislatively bound to act as the ‘critic and conscience
of society’. Condemning any platform for hate speech is a
rare opportunity for the University community to fulfil this
crucial role.</p><p><br>“The University of Auckland equity
policy acknowledges the distinct status of Māori as tangata
whenua and is committed to partnerships that acknowledge the
principles of the Treaty. Hosting Brash directly contravenes
equity principles and the protection of students and staff
from discrimination.

<p><br>“A New University calls on
University of Auckland management to follow through on its
equity policy and strategic plan emphasis on promoting
Māori presence and participation in all aspects of
University life.</p><p><br>“A New University joins the
struggle of those at Massey University in refusing to
accommodate hatred, bigotry and racism in their
institutions. Universities must uphold the principles of Te
Tiriti and ensure the safety of students and staff on
campus.</p><p><br>“There is no room for racism in Aotearoa and
no room for racism in our universities.”</p><p></p><p>
