         Media release<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>Latest commissioner appointment heaps
pressure on Education Minister for urgent
change</p><p><br>Education Minister Chris Hipkins’ decision to
formally dissolve the combined council of WelTec and
Whitireia and appoint a commissioner in its place is a clear
sign that New Zealanders cannot afford for the current model
of tertiary education provision to continue any longer, and
that change is an urgent priority, the Tertiary Education
Union said.</p><p>Taking effect yesterday, the new commissioner
Dr. Neil Barnes’ appointment highlights two important
lessons – first, that the failed policies of the last
National Government are still being felt across the tertiary
sector and placing many of our public institutions in peril,
and, second, that students and staff must have a strong
voice in the decisions affecting their places of study and
work.</p><p>The TEU acknowledged that the Minister’s decision
was, regrettably, a necessary step to ensure future
generations can continue to access life-changing learning
opportunities at WelTec and Whitireia. However, the union
reminded New Zealanders that this is not the first time such
an appointment has had to be made in recent months. Most
recently Chris Hipkins had to step in at Unitec when the
institution fell foul of a now all too familiar pattern in
which systemic underfunding, inadequate policy, poor
decision-making, and lack of student and staff input in
decision-making leads to some institutions needing external
help just to keep the doors open. Staff are increasingly
worried that unless urgent changes are made, these
commissioner appointments will not be the last.

<p>Sandra
Grey, national president of the TEU, said: “Let’s be
absolutely clear about this: the Education Minister has no
other option but to fundamentally reform the tertiary
education sector so that decisions like this do not have to
keep being made. This is the second time in as many months
that the Minister has been forced to appoint a commissioner.
It’s time for New Zealanders to tell him enough is enough
- urgent reform is now essential. The prize of an
accessible, equitable tertiary education sector that serves
us all is far too great for us to sit back and watch as
bailouts keep our institutions open but do little to reverse
the harm the last National Government did to our
sector.</p><p>“The Minister has been taking some great steps
towards long-term change for our sector. As we speak he is
considering some draft recommendations from his officials
about the future of institutes of technology and
polytechnics, following a substantial review carried out by
the Tertiary Education Commission. Chris Hipkins would be
doing a disservice to the New Zealand public, who depend so
heavily on a quality public tertiary education sector, if
urgent reform of the funding model and institutional
governance is not made a
priority.”</p><p>--ENDS--<!-- LINKS REMOVED
