	 <p>
         Tertiary Education Union (TEU) national president Sandra
Grey and NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
president Jonathan Gee today welcomed a new amendment to the
Education Amendment Bill tabled by Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick
that, if passed, will increase student and staff
representation on tertiary education councils.</p><p>“It is
vital that MPs vote to pass this amendment and restore a
strong voice for student and staff on tertiary education
institution councils. I have just returned from Parliament
where I handed over a petition with 900 signatures from
tertiary staff members to Green MP Chlöe Swarbrick urging
parliament to legislate for two staff and two student
representatives on every polytechnic and university
council,” said Sandra Grey.</p><p>“Students and staff have
critical knowledge that must be considered as part of the
strategic planning of our public tertiary education
institutions. They have expertise and experiences of the
day-to-day running of our public institutions that can
ensure that tertiary education institutions remain focused
on their core responsibilities – to deliver benefits to
the public through quality teaching and research.”</p><p>The
previous National-led government scrapped student and staff
representation on polytechnic and university councils.
Steven Joyce’s decision to remove staff from these
councils as part of his push to make tertiary education
institutions more like businesses in their operations has
contributed to a massive decline in the input that staff
could make to decision-making at their place of
work.

<p>“Since coming into office, the new government has
recognised the importance of student and staff expertise in
strategic decision-making in the tertiary education sector.
The TEU and NZUSA applaud this commitment to hearing the
staff and student voice in decision-making and urges MPs to
support the new amendment,” said Jonathan
Gee.</p><p>International evidence supports staff having a much
greater say in the decisions that affect their places of
work. Corporate boards internationally are, for example,
increasingly including staff representatives.</p><p>“The
Education Amendment Bill is a good step to addressing the
lack of a student and staff voice in decison-making. One
more step is now needed to ensure a minimum of two student
and two staff representatives on all tertiary education
institution councils,” he said.</p><p>“Increasing the
overall size of councils will also help include the more
diverse range of voices that is needed to govern our
universities and polytechnics, such as increasing gender
diversity and ensuring Māori
representation.”</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
