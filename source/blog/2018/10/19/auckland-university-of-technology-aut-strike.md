         Auckland University of Technology (AUT) Strike</p><p>Media
release – 19 October 2018<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te
Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa<br> </p><p>AUT strike</p><p>Union
members at the Auckland University of Technology have voted
overwhelmingly in favour of taking strike action in regard
to their collective negotiations that have so far seen
management not agreeing to their salary claims. The claims
include a 3% increase and that the lowest paid staff members
should be paid the Living Wage.</p><p>Tertiary Education Union
(TEU) members are asking for a 3 percent boost in pay for
all staff covered by the collective agreements. This modest
increase would go some way to ensuring salaries at the
university reflect the time, energy and skill that staff put
into their jobs. In addition to this salary claim, staff
have been negotiating collectively for the Living Wage at
AUT. The university has so far refused to accept that the
lowest paid staff working at AUT should be paid the Living
Wage of $20.55 per hour. The union believes that regardless
of whether an employee works full time, or as a student
working in a café, or as a student mentor at AUT, they
should receive this rate which enables them to pay for the
basic necessities of life. AUT needs to follow the lead of
the Auckland City Council which has agreed to pay the Living
Wage to all employees. Basically, it is the right thing for
a university to do.</p><p>Recently over a thousand staff and
students signed a petition calling on the Vice Chancellor to
pay staff the Living Wage.<br>

<p>For two weeks, union
members will not be releasing student marks to AUT. The TEU
has notified the student union of its plans and has told
them that AUT can ensure the release of marks by agreeing to
what the union is asking for.<br> </p><p>Irena Brorens, the
national industrial officer of the TEU, and lead advocate
for negotiations at AUT, said: “What we’re talking about
here are the people who make studying at AUT possible. Every
person at the university makes a huge contribution to the
quality teaching and learning AUT is known for”.<br>
