         </p><p></p><p> A new report launched today by the Tertiary
Education Union (TEU) at Manukau Institute of Technology
(MIT) calls on Education Minister Chris Hipkins to restore a decade of lost tertiary education
funding to at least 2.7 per cent of GDP by 2021, and to
replace National’s failed market model with a public good,
quality education model (1,2,3).</p><p>Government funding of
tertiary education was effectively frozen by National as an
austerity measure between 2009 and 2017. Public tertiary
institutions have not been able to keep up as the real costs
of running the sector have continued to increase over that
time, creating a cumulative hole in the tertiary education
budget of $3.7 billion, which equates to a $661
million hole this year. Based on Treasury figures, the
funding hole will increase to more than $6 billion over the
next 3 years.</p><p>Sandra Grey, TEU National President, said:
<strong>“We know what the impacts of the $3.7 billion
funding hole have been in the tertiary education sector. It
has been paid for by tertiary job cuts, caps on salaries and
an unsustainable reliance on income from overseas students.
The $5.5 billion surplus recently announced by Treasury
shows the economy is strong and the Government can afford to
restore that lost tertiary funding by filling the estimated
$661 million annual cost of the hole.”</strong> Gus
Gilmore, Chief Executive of the Manukau Institute of
Technology, the location for today’s launch, said:
<strong>"The Manukau Institute of Technology supports this
new report written by the TEU into the funding of tertiary
education in Aotearoa. MIT supports the need for a
comprehensive overhaul of how institutions are funded, and
how the government's investment in tertiary education is
determined and allocated. Investment in public institutions
to deliver the best possible outcomes for students is
imperative, both in terms of free access, but also in terms
of sufficient investment in institutions so they can
continue to improve the quality of the tertiary education
delivered."</strong> <strong>Gilmore is among a range of people -
including Green Party MP and tertiary education spokesperson
Chloe Swarbrick, Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Grant
Guilford, other ITP Chief Executives, unions and students -
that have today come out in support of reforming the funding
model.</strong><strong></strong> Some TEU members have
also shared their thoughts on some of the key
reforms that need to be made.  How much, then, should the
tertiary education sector be funded? We know there are
multiple public good benefits to a quality tertiary
education sector (5), so it should be funded to the degree
necessary to provide an accessible, equitable, and inclusive
tertiary education system that contributes to the social and
economic well-being of New Zealand.

<p><strong>“While
further work needs to be done to cost fees-free tertiary
education for all, adequate staffing, and the maintenance of
buildings, we estimate that filling the $3.7 billion hole
will require restoring funding to at least 2.7% of GDP by
2021 (4),” </strong>Grey added.</p><p>The TEU report suggests
where savings can be made (6). These savings are
significant, but will not be enough to fully meet the cost
of running an inclusive tertiary education system. We cannot
meet our goals for a high-quality publicly-accessible
tertiary education system that meets the needs of all New
Zealanders without spending money.<strong> </strong>Such a
system that meets the needs of our communities is an
investment that we must be willing to make through a more
progressive tax system.</p><p><strong>Grey continued:
“Additional funding should not come from cutting other
important social services, but rather through progressive
taxation. New Zealand has to rebuild its tertiary education
system by making its tax policy more progressive and lifting
the top tax rate on the highest income
earners.”</strong><strong></strong> The fiscal and budget
responsibility rules of New Zealand governments will need to
be adjusted if we are to meet social, economic, and
environmental wellbeing goals. The question is, when austere
fiscal responsibility is ranked above social responsibility,
have we got the balance right? When children are living in
poverty, polytechnic courses are being closed, there are not
enough teachers, university classes are overcrowded, and
tertiary students are living in cars, have we really got the
balance of expenditure right?</p><p>A new funding system for the
tertiary sector is both necessary and affordable. The TEU
looks forward to working with the government in creating a
new system, building from a recognition of tertiary
education as an important public good and a commitment to
collaborative decision-making for tertiary education
funding.</p><p>Government funding of tertiary education was $4.5
billion in 2009. It is $4.3 billion in 2018.</p><p>As a
percentage of GDP, total government tertiary education
expenditure (including student loans and allowances) rose
slightly from 2.2 per cent in 2001/2002 to a high of 2.3 per
cent in the year ended June 2010, before falling to 1.6 per
cent in the year ending June 2016. It is still about 1.6 per
cent.</p><p>While just over half of tertiary education funding
comes from public sources in New Zealand, the OECD average
is close to 70 per cent. OECD data shows New Zealand
expenditure per student in tertiary education is US$15,088,
which is below the OECD average of US$16,143, and markedly
less than Australia (US$18,038), the UK (US$24,542), and the
US (US$29,328). The student:staff ratio in New Zealand is 17
students per staff member, higher than the OECD average of
16.</p><p>Currently with both public and private investment in
tertiary education taken into account, New Zealand spends an
average of about 2.0% of GDP on tertiary education, markedly
lower than other OECD nations such as Canada (2.4%) and the
US (2.8%).</p><p>The OECD has calculated that each NZ tertiary
graduate generates an average of more than US$40,000 of net
public benefits as compared with attaining upper secondary
education ($42,800 for women and $65,500 for men, with the
gender difference resulting from labour market
outcomes).</p><p>Savings can be made by reducing time-intensive
metrics measuring processes, removing the need for marketing
to prospective students, and removing time-consuming
tendering processes. Various auditing and compliance
approaches are also cumbersome, costly and damaging to the
core functions of the sector. Other cost savings can be made
within institutions. TEU members highlighted the
unsustainability of the “continually expanding layers of
university management” – something which institutions
also bear responsibility for, but which is shaped by the
context provided by government policy. Government could set
a requirement for the highest salary at an institution to be
no more than five times that of the lowest salary, and use
this as a pre-requisite for receiving public
funding.</p><p><br>ends<!-- LINKS REMOVED
