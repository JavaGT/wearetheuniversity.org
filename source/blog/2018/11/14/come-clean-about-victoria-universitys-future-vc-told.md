           <h1>Come clean about Victoria University’s future, VC told</h1>

             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Tertiary_Education_Union">Tertiary Education Union</a></b></span>

	 <p>
         <strong>The Vice-Chancellor of the Victoria University of
Wellington, Professor Grant Guilford has been told by the
Tertiary Education Union (TEU) to come clean about his plans
for the future of the university after all staff were sent
an email yesterday inviting them to apply for voluntary
redundancy. The TEU has also sought a meeting with him to
discuss this. </strong></p><p>Coming as a surprise to both staff
and the TEU, any staff member who has 15 years or more
continuous service with the university as at 29 March 2019
can apply for a voluntary enhanced leaving package. No
consultation with staff or the union has taken place to
determine what levels of staffing are needed in order to
meet students’ learning and research needs.</p><p>The absence
of due process, or an obvious plan for restructuring the
university, has left a huge question mark hanging over
exactly what the VC is planning for the university. If
significant numbers of staff leave without consultation, and
are not replaced, such a poorly planned exodus would be
likely to have a substantial negative impact on the working
conditions of staff. The obligations of good faith and for
the VC to be a good employer mean that he should have
consulted with staff and their unions ahead of this
announcement, including giving the rationale behind such an
offer. This rationale is significantly absent from the
announcement. There will also be students enrolling for next
year who will almost certainly be asking themselves if the
course they want to study will be affected. If the plan is
to cut expenditure on staffing, this cannot be achieved
without affecting students’ education, the TEU
warned.

<p>Nanette Cormack, deputy secretary of the TEU,
said: <strong>“It beggars belief that the employer would
make this offer without first discussing with students,
staff, or the local community what it means for teaching and
research at the university. Staff are understandably
concerned about having to make a decision about their job
with no information about the future structure of their
workplace, and no chance to have a say on what would work
best for the university and its students. Based on how the
university intends to manage this surprise offer, it is
simply not possible for staff to make an informed decision
about what is right for them and their families, but also
what is right for the students they have dedicated fifteen
years or more to teaching and supporting.
</strong></p><p><strong>“Students themselves are also going to
be asking their own questions about what a potential
university-wide loss of jobs means for their studies.
They’re bound to be looking at their options for next year
wondering if their course is going to be one of the ones
affected by this apparent restructure by stealth. The VC
needs to withdraw the email immediately and commit to a
proper review of university structures, involving full
consultation. The current way of proceeding, if not checked,
will have a profound negative effect on the university and
chilling effect on morale throughout the remainder of the
university.”
