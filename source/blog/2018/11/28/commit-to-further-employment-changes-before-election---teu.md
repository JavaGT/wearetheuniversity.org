<p>Although welcoming the progress of the Employment Relations
Amendment Bill (ERAB) in Parliament this week as a first
step in addressing the imbalance between working people and
employers, the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) today called
on Labour and New Zealand First to commit to further changes
ahead of the next election. </p>

<p>“MPs took a step forward
this week, which is welcome. However we are still a long way
from the changes we need to ensure New Zealand is country
that protects and enhances the right of people to come
together to make their workplaces safe, rewarding, and
fulfilling places to be,” Sharn Riggs, TEU national
secretary said.</p>

<p>Decisions made by successive governments
over recent decades have made it harder and harder for
working people to come together to address issues like low
wages, inadequate meal breaks, and a lack of protection from
arbitrary dismissal within their first 90 days of
employment. National in particular made it more difficult
for people to access help and advice from their union. The
TEU said the ERAB would reverse some of these decisions, but
reminded people that the Bill largely reinstates what we've
had before. As such it needs to be seen as a stepping stone
towards something better.</p>

<p>Sandra Grey, national president
of the TEU, said: “We accept that compromises have to be
made in a coalition government. However, the governing
parties could have said to those responsible for forcing
this compromise ‘we understand where you’re coming from,
but we’re going to make these changes because it’s the
right thing to do for the people we represent.’”
</p>

<p>Most
New Zealanders, many of whom live and work in the regions,
are employed by organisations with fewer than 20 staff that
will not have to comply with one of the best aspects of this
Bill, namely limiting the use of 90-day trial periods.
</p>

<p>Grey added: “We need to remind politicians it was
people, not business, that put them in Parliament. Ahead of
the next election Labour and New Zealand First need to tell
people that this Bill is just the first step on a journey
towards making New Zealand a truly great place to work. This
needs to be backed up by a commitment to make further
changes to employment law if either or both parties form
part of the next
government.”</p>
