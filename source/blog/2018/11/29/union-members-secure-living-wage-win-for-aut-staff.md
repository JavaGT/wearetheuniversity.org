<p><strong>Union members secure Living Wage win for AUT
staff</strong><strong></strong><br><strong></strong><br><strong>Following
successful strike action, members of the Tertiary Education
Union (TEU) at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT)
have voted to accept an improved offer from the employer
that will remove all pay rates below the Living Wage and
boost pay by 3 per cent for all staff that are part of the
AUT Collective Agreements.</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>The
improved offer is the result of staff as part of the
university community standing together to ensure people
working at the University have salaries and conditions that
reflect the time, energy and skill they put into their jobs
– and the contribution they all make to making AUT a great
place to study. It is testament to the power of people
coming together through the TEU that from 1 May next year,
staff covered by the collective agreements will receive the
current Living Wage rate of $20.55 and a 3 per cent increase
for all.</p>

<p>The employer’s revised offer was made towards
the end of Living Wage week, during which TEU members handed
AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack a petition signed by
over 1,200 students, staff, and community members. Union
members at AUT today voted to accept the officer, which also
includes a one-year term and a 10 week union-only benefit
– yet again demonstrating what the TEU can do when people
working in institutions and across Aotearoa New Zealand come
together to improve tertiary education for the benefit of us
all.<p>

<p>Irena Brorens, the TEU’s lead advocate for AUT and
national industrial officer, said:<strong>“This agreement
is a win for all employees at AUT, and a win for students
themselves, as many students are employed by the university
and receiving these new pay rates will boost their living
standards. Everyone involved in this strike action – from
students who waited patiently for their marks, to families
supporting them through exams, to union members coming
together to improve the conditions of work at AUT – should
feel proud of what we have
achieved.”</strong></p>
