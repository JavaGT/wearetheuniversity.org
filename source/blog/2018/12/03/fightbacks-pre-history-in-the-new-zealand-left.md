         <i>Since Fightback’s analysis and articles have been
getting more attention from international comrades, we
regular get questions asking what “tradition” or
organisational pedigree we belong to – are we Trotskyists,
Marxist-Leninists, left-communists, or what? This very brief
historical sketch aims to show how messy and complicated our
background is. We feel, though, that this is a source of
pride rather than embarrassment – in intellectual
tendencies as with animals, hybridity often leads to vigour,
while a “pure” pedigree is another word for
inbreeding!</i></p><p>Fightback traces most of its ancestry back
to the original Communist Party of New Zealand, founded
in 1921. During the splits in between the various
Communist-led states of the 1950s-1970s, the CPNZ
distinguished itself by being the only CP in an advanced
capitalist country to side with China against the Soviet
Union; and was even more unique in siding with Enver
Hoxha’s Albania after its split with China in the late
1970s.</p><p>The paradox of taking such a hard-line
“Stalinist”/”anti-revisionist” line was that the
CPNZ’s brand of “Hoxhaism” was forthright in
condemning both the USSR and China as imperialist countries,
not dissimilar in their global role to the US-led bloc.
After Hoxhaist Albania surrendered to liberal democracy in
1991, after a period of confusion, the CPNZ produced an
analysis (not dissimilar to that of another ex-Hoxhaist
party in the US, the Communist Voice Organization) that
all the so-called Communist countries had in fact been
state-capitalist bureaucratic dictatorships since the time
of Stalin.

<p>This formerly super-Stalinist party had
therefore came to the same conclusion as several tendencies
coming out of the Trotskyist tradition. In a huge historical
irony, after decades of strident anti-Trotskyism, in 1995
the former CPNZ, now known as the Socialist Workers
Organisation, formally adopted the analysis of one of these
state-capitalist tendencies with roots in Trotsky’s
analysis – the International Socialist tendency, led by
the British Socialist Workers Party. However, the SWO was
always something of a “black sheep” within that
tendency, in that it steered a very independent course from
the London “mothership”, and at various times included
members openly identifying with different Marxist trends,
including from an “orthodox” Fourth Internationalist
background.</p><p>Meanwhile, CPNZ veteran Ray Nunes had led a
split in 1990 to form the Workers’ Party of New Zealand,
which described itself as “Marxist-Leninist, pro-Mao but
not Maoist”. Over the years it continued CPNZ tradition by
railing against their former comrades in the SWO for their
capitulation to Trotskyism… Until in the 2000s, in another
historical irony, the WPNZ fused with a “pro-Trotsky but
not Trotskyist” group around the magazine
<i>revolution</i>. (Some documents from the WPNZ before and
after its fusion with <i>revolution</i> can be found on the
Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism
Online.)</p><p>Both parties reached a crisis in 2011-2012.
Socialist Worker had broken with the authority of the
British SWP, but could not come to a consensus on a new
political line and strategy, and decided to wind itself up
in 2012. Meanwhile, the former leading group of the Workers
Party – from both “Mao-ish” and “Trotsky-ish”
tendencies – had decided that building a Leninist party in
New Zealand’s contemporary conditions was impossible, and
had quit in 2011.</p><p>At that point, after decades of
hostility, several former members of Socialist Worker
realised that they had a lot in common with the remaining
Workers Party members – in particular commitment to a
non-dogmatic revolutionary socialism, which combined
activists coming from several different Marxist traditions
and sought an analysis unique to Aotearoa/NZ’s conditions.
The combined organisation renamed itself Fightback in
2013.</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
