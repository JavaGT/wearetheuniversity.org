	 <p>
         <strong>If we were you, Education Minister, this is how
we’d do it</strong><br><strong></strong><br><strong>All
future policy and funding must be based on the understanding
that an accessible, fully funded and quality tertiary
education sector is a core part of people’s every day
lives. That’s the advice staff working in the sector have
given to the Education Minister today in a report published
as part of national education conversation, Kōrero
Mātauranga.</strong></p><p>Published by the Tertiary Education
Union (TEU) and given to Minister Chris Hipkins at a meeting
earlier this afternoon, <i>Voices from Tertiary Education</i>
illustrates the strong connection people studying and
working in the sector have to the Government’s commitment
to build a better New Zealand. Tertiary education staff are
those involved in training the people who go on to play
important roles in our daily lives – whether it is the
builders that build our homes, the doctors or nurses that
care for us, the teachers that teach our kids, the people
that cut our hair and fix our cars, or those that are
dedicated to ensuring we have clean running water and
reliable power. </p><p>People interact with the tertiary
education sector in some way every day of their lives. To
support the Government in delivering on the commitments it
has made – not only in education but in all other areas -
TEU asked students and staff a simple question: “If you
were the Minister for Education, how would you change
tertiary education?” <i>Voices from Tertiary Education
</i>is a summary of the thoughts and ideas TEU received.
Today they have been presented to the Minister as part of
Kōrero Mātauranga to help ensure the Government's reform
of tertiary education benefits us all.

<p>Sandra Grey,
national president of the TEU, said: <strong>“One thing
students and staff share in common with the Education
Minister is a deep commitment to quality public education.
Because of this, and the experience they have of studying
and working in the sector, students and staff have the
expertise to advise the Minister on what he needs to do
rebuild the tertiary education sector so it equips people
with the knowledge and skills we desperately need as a
nation. The Minister has a great foundation from which to do
this – and that’s the pride people working in the sector
have in giving their students the best possible opportunity
to succeed. The ideas they share in this report reflect both
the dedication staff have to their students and their
profession, and to creating a better future for education in
New
Zealand.”</strong><br><strong>--ENDS--</strong><strong></strong></p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
