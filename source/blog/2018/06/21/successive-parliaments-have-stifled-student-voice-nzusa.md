<p>Isabella Lenihan-Ikin, a
student member on the Victoria University of Wellington
Council, who joined NZUSA’s oral submission, said that
‘with Victoria having two student places on its council,
it’s great to have someone who brings a similar lived
experience to me. One student is not able to represent the
views of all students, so having two students doubles the
number of student voices coming through.’</p>

<p>‘Two
student places will make councils more diverse and
reflective of the student community’, says Gee.</p>

<p>NZUSA says that the select committee has the chance to
give community wisdom a stronger place on TEI councils
through:<br>•	Reserving a student seat for the students’
association president<br>•	Requiring at least two staff
and two student places on TEI councils<br>•	Increasing the
size of councils</p>

<p>‘As public institutions, our
communities (and taxpayers) expect public benefit from our
institutions, not just private return. It’s therefore
essential that community wisdom has a stronger place on TEI
councils through increasing the number of staff and student
seats.’</p>
