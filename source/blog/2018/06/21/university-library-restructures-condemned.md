<p>A New University: Auckland University Library
Restructures condemned by Students, Staff and Alumni</p>

<p><br>A
New University, a group committed to the democratisation of
the University of Auckland, strongly condemns the decision
made by Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellor of the University
of Auckland, to restructure the University's Libraries and
Learning Services.</p>

<p>The organisation composed of staff,
students, and alumni, along with concerned community
members. They oppose this violent restructure, which will
result in the closure of specialist Creative Arts and
Industries libraries, and their consolidation into an
already overloaded general library. Moreover, the
restructure will see the disestablishment of 112 positions,
to be replaced with 96.5 new ones. This amounts to a loss of
15.5 full time roles.</p>

<p>The Dean of Creative Arts and
Industries has announced a meeting, intending to inform
students about these decision. However, this is not the end.
Communities across the university will be attending to make
their voices heard.</p>

<p>When: Thursday, 21st June,
12-12.30pm</p>

<p>Where: CAI Student Centre (Level 2,
Architecture Building 421, reception area).</p>

<p>Who: Student
Reps, Student Association Presidents, Diane Brand (CAI
dean), Sue Roberts (Libraries and Learning Services
director)</p>

<p>These decisions are being dictated to students
and staff who are the lifeblood of the university. There has
been no appropriate consultation with those who are foremost
affected by the restructures. It is evident that this
university management, concerned with profits and
cost-cutting, has failed our wider communities. Democratic
control of the university is therefore
necessary.<p>
<p>Spokesperson for A New University, Vanessa
Harvey, said “These closures were widely and actively
opposed by not only students and staff within the directly
affected faculties, but also students and staff from across
the wider university, including the University Senate,
alumni, and members of the community. It highlights the
failure of the current university management and
administration.”</p>

<p>“Stuart McCutcheon and the current
University Council marginalise university voices with
government appointees. The profit model of the university
treats education as a business, leading to the demise of the
academic environment, and the calcification of
ideas.”</p>

<p>“A New University is advocating for, and will
take strong action towards, democratic control of the
university. We want the university to be an academic
institute and a place of learning. This means replacing the
current University Council model with a decolonised
democratic model. The university should be run by students,
staff, and tangata whenua as those who make the university.
Only when we control our own universities will these
institutions flourish. Until then we will witness them
decay.”</p>

<p>“We call upon all those affected and the wider
community to support us in demanding democratic student
staff control of the
university.”</p>
