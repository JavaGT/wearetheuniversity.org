           <h1>Minister congratulated for boost to tertiary funding</h1>

           <span class="byline"><b>Wednesday, 27 June 2018,  4:38 pm</b><br>
             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Tertiary_Education_Union">Tertiary Education Union</a></b></span>

         </div>

	 <p>
         </p><p>The Tertiary Education Union (TEU) welcomed the Minister
for Education, Chris Hipkins’ announcement today that he
will inject a further $31.7 million into the tertiary
education sector to ensure students continue to get the best
possible learning experience at institutions up and down the
country.</p><p>Funding for per-student subsidy rates will be
boosted by 1.6 percent from 2019, and will be paid for
within the spending limits announced in the recent Budget.
The TEU said it welcomed the increase as a sign that the
Minister is taking seriously the challenges left behind by
the previous National Government. After the disappointment
of the Budget, where no additional funding for the tertiary
sector was announced, today’s increase will help to
stabilise the sector whilst essential work is done to reform
the sector and the way it is funded.</p><p>Government officials
from the Ministry for Education and the Tertiary Education
Commission are currently working to implement the
Minister’s ambitious Education Work Plan. As Chris Hipkins
points out in today’s media release, this work must
include a detailed review of the last government’s failed
funding system – a model that has caused so many of the
problems policymakers are now trying to address.</p><p>Sandra
Grey, national president of the TEU, said: “Today’s
announcement will be a welcome relief for many in the
tertiary education sector. The Minister should be
congratulated for recognising the challenges facing our
public institutions and for stepping up to support them
whilst we work together to solve the mess left by the last
National Government.

<p>“We have been saying for years that
the funding system is broken and we are pleased that the
Minister has taken on board our concerns and committed to
reviewing the way the sector is funded. However, whilst
announcements like the one the Minister made today are
welcome, these mid-year funding increases cannot become the
norm. What the Minister needs to do is get us together as
sector to discuss how we are going to put in place a
sustainable funding system that recognises different
community and student needs.”</p><p>Whilst the TEU welcomed
today’s announcement, it did also warn the government that
the benefits of the funding boost could soon be lost if the
Minister for Immigration, Iain Lees-Galloway pursues his
current proposal to change student post-study work rights.
Over nine years, the previous National-led Government
changed the tertiary education sector and cut funds by so
much that many institutions now depend on attracting
increasing numbers of international students to maintain
financial viability. Iain Lees-Galloway needs to be careful
to ensure there are no knock-on effects on public
institutions that National has made reliant on fees from
international students, the TEU
said.</p><p>--ENDS--<!-- LINKS REMOVED
