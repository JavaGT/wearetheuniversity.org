<p> </p>
<p>Fees-free: we’re getting it all
    wrong</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
    Associations (NZUSA) is challenging the assertion that a 0.3
    percent increase in tertiary enrolments this year means that
    fees-free has been a failure. The Government introduced free
    fees for the first year of tertiary education and training
    on 1 January 2018.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘We’re forgetting what this
    policy is ultimately about – making education accessible
    for all,’</p>
<p>says National President Jonathan Gee.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>‘The measure of success needs to be more than just
    increased enrolments, but also increased diversity in
    tertiary education. For example, if we have more students
    who are Māori, Pasifika, older, have disabilities, or are
    the first in their family to engage in tertiary study, then
    that would equal success.’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gee says that claiming
    failure of the policy after only 6 months of implementation
    is unhelpful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘You cannot evaluate a policy after
    just 6 months. The benefits of free tertiary education will
    take time to be realised. Less student debt means that when
    fees-free students graduate they’ll be better equipped to
    get on with their lives quicker including buying a home,
    having kids and saving for their retirement.’</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>‘Fees-free also sends a message to potential students
    (and their parents) that tertiary education is a worthy
    investment. This is particularly relevant for those from
    families with no tertiary education background or in the
    regions. Education is the great social leveller and we all
    have a right to take part in it.’

<p> </p>
<p>Gee says free
    tertiary education is only one part of the vision for an
    accessible education for all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Free tertiary
    education, like any other policy, is no silver bullet. If a
    more accessible education is our goal then there is more we
    can do, such as improving careers education, as well as
    celebrating those who decide to learn rather than earn for a
    few years to make a greater contribution to New
    Zealand.’</p>
