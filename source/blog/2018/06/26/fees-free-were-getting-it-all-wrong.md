<p>Gee says free
    tertiary education is only one part of the vision for an
    accessible education for all.</p>

<p>‘Free tertiary
    education, like any other policy, is no silver bullet. If a
    more accessible education is our goal then there is more we
    can do, such as improving careers education, as well as
    celebrating those who decide to learn rather than earn for a
    few years to make a greater contribution to New
    Zealand.’</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
