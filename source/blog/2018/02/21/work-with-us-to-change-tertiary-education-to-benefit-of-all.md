         Government plans announced today to build a truly inclusive,
accessible and high quality public education system,
overhauling the way future generations of Kiwis are taught,
will require government, staff, students, iwi, and community
groups working together to ensure we get the changes we
need.</p><p>The Tertiary Education Union (TEU) welcomed the
Government’s new education work programme and said it
provides an opportunity to end the crisis facing tertiary
education. Reforms introduced by the previous National
government have wreaked havoc on the sector, forcing courses
to close, jobs to be lost, and essential campus services to
be shutdown. The new work programme gives future students
hope that they can develop skills, learn trades, and create
knowledge in a truly public tertiary education system that
will empower them to fulfil their potential and lead good
lives.</p><p>Plans put forward in the work programme include
reforming the institute of technology and polytechnic (ITP)
sector and a full review of the flawed Performance
Based-Research Fund (PBRF), two recommendations the TEU put
forward in its briefing to the new Minister last year.
The plan will also focus on raising achievement for Māori
and Pasifika learners, work that will require a strong focus
on tertiary education.

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of
the Tertiary Education Union, said: <strong>“It is clear
to me that despite our day-to-day concerns as staff or
students or managers, there is a strong consensus on the
major issues of importance for tertiary education. It is now
down to us as a sector to work together for the changes we
need. People also need to tell politicians that this is a
big issue and that come the next election they will be
judged on whether this three year plan has delivered genuine
change for education.</strong></p><p><strong>“We congratulate
the Minister and his team for putting forward a potentially
transformative plan for the future of education. It has come
about because we finally have a government that will listen
to what staff and students have been saying for years. The
plan provides a strong sense of the direction the government
would like to go in. However, Ministers cannot fix the
crisis facing tertiary education alone. We all have a role
to play in </strong>making this
work<strong>.”</strong></p><p><strong>--ENDS--</strong></p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
