<p><strong>Return of staff to tertiary councils welcomed, but
not enough</strong><br><strong></strong><br>Plans announced
by the government today to restore the legal right of staff
and students to have representative on Tertiary Education
Institution councils will strengthen decision-making,
ensuring it better reflects the demands of teaching and
learning, the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) said.</p>

<p>The
Education Amendment Bill introduced to Parliament this
afternoon by Education Minister Chris Hipkins will require
all universities, polytechnics and wānanga to have staff
and student representatives as full members of their
councils. The changes are the result of years of campaigning
by TEU members for staff to a have a greater say in the
strategic direction of their institutions.</p>

<p>The Bill, once
passed into law, will primarily affect polytechnic councils,
many of which removed staff and student seats when the
previous National-led Government scrapped the representation
requirement. However, the TEU said the legislation still
needed to be strengthened if genuine democratic
accountability is to be restored to all university,
polytechnic and wānanga councils.</p>

<p>Sandra Grey, national
president of the Tertiary Education Union, said: “
<strong>These changes are credit to our members for not
giving up in their campaign to have a much greater say in
how their institutions are run. They have known all along
that the best results are achieved when staff, students,
institutions and the local community are collectively
responsible for decisions about the teaching, learning and
research that is carried out at our institutions, and it is
great to have a government that has finally
listened.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>“Whilst the government should
be congratulated for taking this step, it is important to
note that for us this is just the start of a conversation.
For representatives to properly reflect the needs of
students, staff and the wider community there needs to be
more than just one representative of each group sitting on
council. We will be calling on the government to amend the
Bill to allow for councils of 12 and 18 members, with one
third of seats reserved for staff and student
representatives.”</strong><strong></strong><br><strong>--ENDS--</strong><strong></strong></p>
