<p>‘Having students involved in the ITP
decision making process is not only exciting, but important
as it will help to further strengthen the student voice,’
says Izzy Paterson (President, Association of Students at
UCOL).</p>

<p>Evans says that this is just the first step to
effective and true student representation.</p>

<p>‘Student
voice does not exist in a vacuum. In order for genuine
student voice to take place on councils, institutions must
be willing to support student representatives through
training, resourcing, connecting them with the independent
students’ association and instilling a culture of hearing
and heeding the student voice across the institution.’</p>

<p>NZUSA looks forward to engaging with Members of
Parliament to ensure that the legislation is as robust as
possible to facilitate effective student voice.</p>
