<p>Learning Support on Borrowed Time as Auckland Uni VC Plans
Major Library Restructure</p>

<p><br><strong>Union members at the
University of Auckland are disappointed by management plans
published today to cut 45 full-time equivalent jobs in
Libraries and Learning Services Te Tumu
Herenga.</strong></p>

<p>People working in these 45 FTE positions
are among the more than 114 dedicated staff members who have
been told by management that their current roles will be
disestablished, as the impact of the restructure on a range
of other university services was made clear at a staff
meeting today. Management plans include proposals to close a
significant number of service points across the university,
reducing the number of places students can go to receive
expert learning and research support.</p>

<p>Enzo Giordani,
organiser of the Tertiary Education Union at the University
of Auckland, said: <strong>“We are concerned that the
proposals management has announced today will have a
detrimental impact on students’ learning experience at the
University of Auckland. We understand the way students
access information is changing, but what’s been set out
today goes beyond modernising services and actually cuts
back on the places students can go to get expert support.
This speaks to the broader issue of a failed government
funding model that is forcing our public institutions to
function like businesses, rather than on the learning,
research and teaching needs of their students and
staff.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“The timing of today’s
announcement also doesn’t make sense in the context of the
government’s vision for education. The Minister has
outlined an ambitious plan to review our education system as
a whole, to look at what we’re doing and to make changes
that will ensure an inclusive, public education system
focused on meeting the needs of learners. It’s hard to
understand why the University would want to make major
changes to the way students are supported in their learning
before we’ve talked as a country about what we want from
our education system."</strong><p>

<p>Some of the potentially
impacted staff were told by management on Friday that they
may no longer have a job at the university, leaving them to
face a difficult weekend discussing future options with
their whānau. Others were told yesterday ahead of a meeting
with all staff today. Consultation on the plans is now open
until 30 April. The process exposes the flawed approach
universities have to involving staff in decisions about
significant change. A small group of management has spent
months making decisions without talking directly to the
people whose livelihoods those decisions affect. Management
then hands out a proposal that gives the people affected
only a few weeks to respond – a short period of time which
in this instance is punctuated by the Easter break. The
approach does not work for students, staff or the wider
community impacted by major changes such as
these.</p>
