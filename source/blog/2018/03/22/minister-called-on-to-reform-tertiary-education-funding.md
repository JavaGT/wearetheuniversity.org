         <br>Media release<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>Minister called on to reform tertiary
education funding model</p><p><br>Students, staff, and
Vice-Chancellors have come together to call on the Minister
for Education, Chris Hipkins, to work with the sector to
change the existing funding model for tertiary
education.</p><p>Representatives at the Voices from Tertiary
Education forum on 9 March 2018 at the Victoria University
of Wellington called for the change as part of a wide
ranging statement that sets out a series of recommendations
for the reform of universities. The recommendations call on
the Minister to:</p><p>work with students, staff and sector
leaders to co-design an improved funding model;<br>bring
together students, staff, business, iwi, local communities
and institutional leaders at regular forums to discuss a
long-term plan for the tertiary education sector;<br>work
with the Minister of Finance, Grant Robertson, to develop a
framework to better measure the huge contribution tertiary
education makes to society;<br>to ensure the next Tertiary
Education Strategy provides pathways and financial support
at all levels for staff and students to learn and teach Te
Reo Māori.<br>A copy of the statement has been sent to the
Minister for Education and the Tertiary Education
Commission.</p><p>Sandra Grey, National President of the
Tertiary Education Union, said: “It is really positive to
see students, staff and vice-chancellors working together,
digging deep into analysing the problems facing the
university sector and putting forward practical solutions.
There is a shared view across the sector that the existing
funding model is compromising delivery of quality,
accessible tertiary education. The Minister needs to get us
all around the table so we can get this sorted and focus on
what we’re all here to do – that is to give students the
best possible learning experience at their chosen
institution.”

<p>Grant Guilford, Vice-Chancellor of the
Victoria University of Wellington, said: “This statement
signals our commitment to working with government, students,
staff and sector leaders to ensure universities are in the
best possible place locally, nationally and globally to
deliver for all New Zealanders. Part of this is about
improving the existing funding model so universities can be
better supported to focus on what we do best – providing
quality education and research to a broad range of learners.
I was really pleased to be part of the forum and think it
provides a valuable model going forward for how we can all
work together to co-design the university sector of the
future.”</p><p>Jonathan Gee, President of the New Zealand
Union of Student Associations, said: “Making sure
universities work for a diverse range of learners, including
Māori, Pasifika, second chance learners, sole parents and
mature students, is vitally important. To make it happen, we
have to make sure there are minimal financial, physical,
cultural and generational barriers to learning. Students and
staff also have to be at the heart of all planning and
decisions in the sector. The statement we agreed provides
the Minister with a way of making this happen whilst also
ensuring the funding model is improved to better meet the
needs of all learners, employers, staff, and local
communities.”</p><p>--ENDS--<!-- LINKS REMOVED
