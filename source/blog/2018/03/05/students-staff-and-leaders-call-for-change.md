<p><strong>Students, staff and tertiary education
sector leaders call for
change</strong><br><strong></strong></p>

<p><br><strong>Students,
staff, and institutional leaders represented at the
<i>Voices from Tertiary Education </i>forum on 1 March 2018
at Manukau Institute of Technology, have called on the
Minister for Education, Chris Hipkins, to develop a new
funding model for vocational education and training that
meets the needs of all New
Zealanders.</strong></p>

<p>Representatives at the forum called
for the change as part of a wide ranging statement that sets out a
series of recommendations to reform the vocational education
and training sector. The recommendations call on the
Minister to:</p>

<p>•	Work with staff, students and sector
leaders to develop a new funding model</p>

<p>•	Ensure a new
funding model guarantees the regional provision of tertiary
education, so all people can access learning opportunities
in their communities</p>

<p>•	Take the immediate step in Budget
2018 of changing the Student Achievement Component funding
under-delivery figure to a more reasonable level</p>

<p>•	Host
further forums dedicated to discussing the future of the
vocational education and training sector</p>

<p>•	Build a
system that recognises and provides for diverse learners -
including, but not limited to, Māori, Pasifika, second
chance learners, sole parents, mature students, students
with disabilities, and LGBTI<br>•	<br>A copy of the
statement has been sent to the Minister for Education and
the Tertiary Education Commission.
</p>

<p>Sandra Grey, National
President of the Tertiary Education Union, said:
<strong>“It was fantastic to have students, staff and
sector leaders together in one place to discuss the future
of vocational education and training. The statement we
agreed provides a way forward for the sector that would
ensure access to lifelong learning opportunities for all New
Zealanders, which would benefit our families, whānau,
communities and the economy. We are committed to working
with everyone at the forum yesterday to make these changes
happen.”</strong></p>

<p>Gus Gilmore, Chief Executive of the
Manukau Institute of Technology, said: <strong>“This
statement signals our commitment to working with government,
students, staff and sector leaders to ensure institutes of
technology and polytechnics can continue to provide
transformative learning opportunities for a diverse range of
students in communities up and down the country. The public
vocational education and training sector is hugely
successful and at the forefront of innovative teaching, and
it is vital this continues for the benefit of us
all.”</strong></p>

<p>Jonathan Gee, President of the New
Zealand Union of Student Associations,
said:<strong>“Making sure the vocational education and
training sector works for a diverse range of learners,
including Māori, Pasifika, second chance learners, sole
parents and mature students, is vitally important. To make
it happen, students must have a strong voice at the heart of
all planning and decisions in the sector . The statement we
agreed yesterday provides the Minister with a way of making
this happen whilst also securing a new funding model that
meets the needs of learners of all ages, employers, staff,
and local communities.”</strong></p><p>1.	A copy of the
