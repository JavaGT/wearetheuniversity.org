<p>Sandra Grey, National
President of the Tertiary Education Union, said:
<strong>“It was fantastic to have students, staff and
sector leaders together in one place to discuss the future
of vocational education and training. The statement we
agreed provides a way forward for the sector that would
ensure access to lifelong learning opportunities for all New
Zealanders, which would benefit our families, whānau,
communities and the economy. We are committed to working
with everyone at the forum yesterday to make these changes
happen.”</strong></p><p>Gus Gilmore, Chief Executive of the
Manukau Institute of Technology, said: <strong>“This
statement signals our commitment to working with government,
students, staff and sector leaders to ensure institutes of
technology and polytechnics can continue to provide
transformative learning opportunities for a diverse range of
students in communities up and down the country. The public
vocational education and training sector is hugely
successful and at the forefront of innovative teaching, and
it is vital this continues for the benefit of us
all.”</strong></p><p>Jonathan Gee, President of the New
Zealand Union of Student Associations,
said:<strong>“Making sure the vocational education and
training sector works for a diverse range of learners,
including Māori, Pasifika, second chance learners, sole
parents and mature students, is vitally important. To make
it happen, students must have a strong voice at the heart of
all planning and decisions in the sector . The statement we
agreed yesterday provides the Minister with a way of making
this happen whilst also securing a new funding model that
meets the needs of learners of all ages, employers, staff,
and local communities.”</strong></p><p></p><p>1.	A copy of the
