         Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o
Aotearoa</p><p></p><p>Toi-Ohomai job cuts further proof Minister
must fix tertiary funding model</p><p><br>Plans announced today
by the management of Toi-Ohomai Institute of Technology to
cut jobs because the institution did not meet narrow funding
metrics is further evidence that the current tertiary
education funding model is broken and failing to meet the
needs of local communities.</p><p>Dr. Leon Fourie, Chief
Executive of Toi-Ohomai, notified staff today of his
intention to “adjust” 18.4 full-time equivalent teaching
roles across the institution. The job losses follow a large
number of allied staff redundancies made by management last
year, disproportionately impacting on women employed at the
institution.</p><p>Rules imposed by the last National government
penalise tertiary education institutions for not getting
enough bums on seats. Instances where an institution enrols
fewer than 99 percent of the students needed to meet its
funding provision for the year, the institution must pay
money back. Such rules destabilise institutions, and often
force courses to close and jobs to be lost. In a statement
signed by staff, students and Chief Executives of
polytechnics at last week’s the Voices from Tertiary
Education forum the Minister was urged to change these rules
in the forthcoming Budget, something he said he was open to
doing [1].</p><p>Sharn Riggs, national secretary of the Tertiary
Education Union, said: “We are extremely disappointed with
the Chief Executive’s announcement today. Current funding
rules are based on meeting narrow, market-based metrics that
ignore the huge contribution institutions like Toi-Ohomai
make to their communities. The Minister has been told by
sector leaders, staff and students that this model needs to
change, now’s the time to make it happen.

<p>“Public
institutions like Toi-Ohomai are responsible for some of the
most creative and innovative teaching in the country, and
the funding model must support this. It is vital these
institutions can continue to push the boundaries of what’s
possible in tertiary education and are not repeatedly
destabilised by a funding model that has proven time and
time again to be broken. Working with staff and the local
community we will do as much as we can to urge Dr. Fourie to
revisit these
plans.”</p><p>--ENDS--<!-- LINKS REMOVED
