<p>‘Two wrongs do not
make a right. Threatening cuts to funding key student
services in order to get what you want is not fair game.
Everybody loses,’ says Jason Woodroofe, Albany Students’
Association President.</p>

<p>The Vice-Chancellor has also
broken the trust of staff and students through assuring them
that her main consideration in preventing Don Brash from
speaking was security, when this has clearly not been the
case. She has misled the Chair of Academic Board, who are in
part the guardians of the university’s role of being
society’s critic and conscience.</p>

<p>‘We join
Massey’s students’ associations in their call for their
University Council to clarify its stance on funding
independent students’ associations. The Vice-Chancellor
has broken the trust we have with our institutions, and we
want to rebuild that.’</p><p>ENDS
