         Strengthen the commitment for the public good</p><p>Staff and
students in tertiary education institutions are calling on
parliament to be bolder and ensure their expertise around
teaching, learning, and research is taken seriously in
strategic planning for institutions.</p><p><br>The Education
Amendment Bill is back before parliament today, but the
proposed amendments to the bill do not go far enough for
NZUSA and NZTEU. Tertiary education staff and students are
urging parliament to legislate that all TEI council’s must
have two staff and two student seats, with representatives
democratically elected.</p><p>The Education and Workforce select
committee report recommends only one student member of
councils and one staff member of councils be required, with
polytechs and universities given the option of having two
staff representative if they want.</p><p> “Who would you
expect to hear from if you were making strategic decisions
about what support and academic services are needed for
today’s learners to ensure they remain engaged in their
studies – well students and staff for a start.” says
Jonathan Gee from NZUSA</p><p>“Sadly a single student
representatives’ ideas could be easily overlooked and
crowded out on councils which will still have a significant
majority of the membership made up of ministerial
appointments and those with corporate expertise. If teaching
and learning is to be at the heart of our tertiary education
system, as it should be in order to deliver daily for all
kiwis, parliament must act now.”

<p>NZTEU president Sandra
Grey says the very significant failures in our tertiary
education sector recently could have perhaps been less
severe if council’s had been able to draw on staff and
student expertise.</p><p>“This is why hundreds of staff made
submissions to the select committee urging for one third of
the council seats to be occupied by staff and students,
leaving two thirds for business, community, and iwi
leaders.”</p><p>“It’s great to see the select committee
recognising that staff and students have the requisite
expertise to sit on councils – but we need parliament to
be bolder around the council composition.”</p><p>The changes
to the Education Amendment Bill section on council
composition are a credit to our members who have long
campaigned to have a much greater say in how their
institutions are run. They have known all along that the
best results are achieved when staff, students, institutions
and the local community are collectively responsible for
decisions about the teaching, learning and research that are
carried out at our institutions, and it is great to have a
government that has finally listened.</p><p>As well as
increasing staff and student representation, parliament
could be bolder around the numbers of seats in order to
ensure diversity of members at the table. “The select
committee heard the strong submissions from TEU members on
the need to increase the number of seats on polytechnic
councils as well, though it has only recommended lifting to
ten at
most.<!-- LINKS REMOVED
