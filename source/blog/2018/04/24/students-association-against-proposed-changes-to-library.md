	 <p>
         Press Release – Auckland University Students’
Association is against the proposed changes to libraries at
the University of Auckland.</p><p>Auckland University
Students’ Association (AUSA) is deeply concerned by the
University of Auckland’s proposal to close five libraries,
and restructure library and learning services.</p><p>This
proposal will not only close the Maori and Pasifika Archive,
Music, Fine Arts, Architecture, Epsom and Tamaki libraries,
but appears to be moving the University towards a system
where all City libraries are merged into one centralised
library. In the process, there will be a reduction in the
number of specialised staff available to help students, a
reduction in the number of student study spaces on campus,
and the fragmentation and removal of special collections
into off-campus storage.</p><p>For example, both the Fine
Arts and Architecture libraries are the largest collections
of their type in the Southern Hemisphere. In particular, the
Elam library is highly valued among the wider Arts community
and the University itself, who promotes this library as a
“collection of national significance.” As the heart of
the Elam Art School, the library is the only place to study
within the school.</p><p>There has been no formal attempt
to consult students. As it involves the loss of 45 jobs, we
have been told that ‘it it University practice not to
involve students in decisions like this’.</p><p>However,
students are outraged by this proposal. Already, 2000
students have signed our petition, and a further 1000
students have made submissions against these changes.

<p>We are holding a rally on the 30th April at 12pm, and
are making a formal submission to the University.</p><p>We
consider that this represents a worrying deprioritization of
the Arts in University funding models. We are calling on the
Government to change University funding models, so STEM
isn’t prioritized at the expense of the Arts. We are also
calling on the University to protect student study spaces,
and show us they care about the Arts and our Education.
