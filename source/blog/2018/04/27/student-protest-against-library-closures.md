<p>Student protest against library closures calling on the
Government to better fund the Arts</p>

<p>Almost 1000 students
plan to attend the Rally against the closure of five
libraries at the University of Auckland.<p>

<p>The students
will be delivering a petition to the Vice Chancellor, which
already has 4000 signatures on Monday at 12pm outside the
General Library.<p>

<p>“Students’ response to this proposal
shows how angry and concerned we are” says Education
Vice-President, Jessica Palairet.</p>

<p>“Libraries are at the
heart of our University. They provide spaces for students to
study, specialists to help with research and essay writing,
and access to some of the best collections in the Southern
Hemisphere”.<p>

<p>“We shouldn’t have to protest about
the University taking away fundamental resources. But the
fact they are doing it without proper student consultation
makes it even more important that we do”, says Palairet.
“Students have been told that because this affects staff,
we can’t submit on the proposal. This isn’t good enough.
The lack of any formal student consultation is locking out
the voices of those who will be most affected by these
proposed changes - students!”</p>

<p>“The Proposal to shut
down libraries represents a wider problem with the way
Universities are funded. A free first year doesn’t matter
if Universities aren’t funded enough to provide students
with quality library resources.”</p>

<p>“Further, we want the
Government to stop prioritising Stem subjects at the expense
of the Arts. While the University builds new science
buildings and extravagant new gyms, the Arts and our
libraries are being consistently underfunded”, says
Palairet.<p>
<p>“We’re calling on the Government to
respond. They need to put their money where their mouth is,
and better fund Universities and the Arts. The current
‘bums on seats’ and research-orientated model isn’t
working.”</p>

<p>“Cutting costs shouldn’t come at the
expense of our education”.</p>

<p>The rally against the library
closures will be held at 12pm outside the General Library on
Alfred Street. We welcome any media enquiries.
