<p>‘My intense one-year masters means that I can’t get
a job while I study. I’ve had to move back home because I
couldn’t afford my rent on top of travel costs to drive to
placement each day. I’ve wanted to be a teacher my whole
life but it’s been a struggle’, says Katrina (Master of
Teaching and Learning, University of Otago).</p>

<p>Those
who have missed out on the opportunity of postgraduate study
are also speaking out.</p>

<p>‘I’m passionate about
reducing New Zealand’s horrific suicide rate through
studying towards a career in psychology. Unfortunately due
to the lack of financial support at postgraduate level
I’ve had to put that dream on hold’, says Nicole
(Bachelor of Social Science in Psychology, University of
Waikato).</p>

<p>Education Minister Chris Hipkins has yet
to respond to NZUSA’s written request to restore
postgraduate allowances.</p>

<p>The petition can be found
on: <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Four.actionstation.org.nz%2Fpetitions%2Frestore-the-postgraduate-student-allowance-now&amp;e=96a217cc8fd583b68bf0086c230fcdc10c832467&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=postgrad1&amp;n=1" target="_blank">https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/restore-the-postgraduate-student-allowance-now</a></p>
