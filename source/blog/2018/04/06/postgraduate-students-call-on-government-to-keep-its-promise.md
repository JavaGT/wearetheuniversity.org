         <strong>Postgraduate students call on Government to keep its
promise</strong><strong></strong></p><p>The teachers,
psychologists and leaders of the future are calling on the
Government to restore postgraduate student allowances in its
upcoming Budget announcement in May. This follows a petition
launched on Wednesday by the New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations (NZUSA), calling for an urgent
start date for the restoration of the allowance.</p><p>Postgraduate allowances were scrapped by the previous
Government in 2013. Labour, along with the Greens and New
Zealand First, pledged to restore the postgraduate allowance
during last year’s general election.</p><p>‘The
current Government says that it’s committed to issues such
as addressing the mental health crisis, uplifting the
teaching profession and tackling climate change. In order
for this work to succeed, we urgently need to be supporting
our people to gain skills in these areas. A postgraduate
student allowance is an easy first step towards making this
a reality,’ says National Student President Jonathan
Gee.</p><p>Postgraduate students from across the country
have come forward to tell their stories of struggling
without an allowance.</p><p>‘Psychology is my passion
and to be able to work in the field you need to be qualified
at postgraduate level. Due to the lack of postgrad
allowances my family and kids have had to suffer in order
for me to get a respectable career so I’m able to provide
for them. This needs to change’, says Lisa (Master of
Science in Psychology, University of Auckland).

<p>‘My intense one-year masters means that I can’t get
a job while I study. I’ve had to move back home because I
couldn’t afford my rent on top of travel costs to drive to
placement each day. I’ve wanted to be a teacher my whole
life but it’s been a struggle’, says Katrina (Master of
Teaching and Learning, University of Otago).</p><p>Those
who have missed out on the opportunity of postgraduate study
are also speaking out.</p><p>‘I’m passionate about
reducing New Zealand’s horrific suicide rate through
studying towards a career in psychology. Unfortunately due
to the lack of financial support at postgraduate level
I’ve had to put that dream on hold’, says Nicole
(Bachelor of Social Science in Psychology, University of
Waikato).</p><p>Education Minister Chris Hipkins has yet
to respond to NZUSA’s written request to restore
postgraduate allowances.</p><p>The petition can be found
