<p>Aotearoa’s three biggest education unions have joined
forces to put education funding on the political agenda in
the runup to this year’s general election.</p>

<p>The
Tertiary Education Union, NZEI Te Riu Roa and the Post
Primary Teachers’ Association have released
a report, prepared by BERL, that shows Aotearoa is
significantly underinvesting in
education.</p>

<p>Education funding per student in New
Zealand is 27.8% lower than Canada, 22.4% lower than
Australia, 26.4% lower than the UK and 24.9% lower than the
OECD average.</p>

<p>Chris Abercrombie, Te Wehengarua | Post
Primary Teachers' Association acting president says “the
BERL report released by TEU today shows that the level of
public funding of education in Aotearoa New Zealand is
woeful, compared with other countries in the
OECD.”</p>

<p>“All New Zealanders deserve a quality,
publicly funded education from pre-school through to
tertiary. An investment in education at all levels would
give more people more skills, better incomes, more
employment opportunities, more equality, more fulfilling
lives and fewer social problems. It is a win win which this
country cannot afford not to do.”</p>

<p>NZEI Te Riu Roa
president Mark Potter said that better investment in
education in schooling and early childhood would be a
popular and well supported move.</p>

<p>“Parents and
whānau would strongly welcome smaller class sizes in
schools and lower ratios in early childhood centres so that
teachers have more time with tamariki, and much better
access to learning support specialists to make sure no one
misses out on the support they need. So let’s get on and
do it,” he said.</p>

<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union Tumu Whakarae | National President Dr Julie
Douglas says “BERL’s research shows this is not a
failing of any one government in isolation – this is a
long-term collective failure by us as a country to value
education.”</p>

<p>“While we would have liked the current
government to do more the right’s track record is worse
and, if elected, National’s tax plan will result in even
less money for education. If voters want a world class
education system we must demand better from all the
political parties.”</p>

<p>The TEU is campaigning for its
12,000 members to vote for tertiary education at the
election.</p>

<p>Dr Douglas says “Aotearoa needs increases
to education funding that will bring our expenditure per
EFTS up to the OECD average over the next six years. We also
need a mandated staff voice in decisions that affect the
future of the tertiary sector and funding increases that are
fairly allocated to staff
costs.”</p>
