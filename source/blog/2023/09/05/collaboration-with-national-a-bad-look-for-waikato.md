<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
dismayed to note the inappropriate extent to which Te Whare
Wānanga o Waikato | The University of Waikato’s Vice
Chancellor has been collaborating with the National Party on
their policy for a third medical school.</p>

<p>A Radio New
Zealand report this morning exposed a number of emails
between Professor Quigley and National’s Shane Reti.
Amongst other things, the Vice Chancellor described the
potential for the first intake of students in 2027 as "a
present to you to start your second term in
government!"</p>

<p>TEU has previously
criticised National’s policy as ‘pork barrel
politics’ and an ineffective way to resolve either the
crisis in tertiary education or the doctor shortage. These
statements were made shortly after it was brought to light
that Waikato
University had spent almost a million dollars over the last
3 years for strategic advice from former Minister of
Tertiary Education Steven Joyce.</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei |
National Secretary Sandra Grey says all of our criticisms
made three months ago still hold true. “This is not the
right time to be setting up a new medical school. If the
last year has proved anything it’s that the tertiary
sector needs more cooperation not
competition.”</p>

<p>“Most of the sector, including
Waikato University, are experiencing a funding crisis,
budget deficits that are causing redundancies as well as
course and programme closures – the $380 million
dollars’ worth of set-up costs alone this project would
swallow up could be much better spent
elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“We absolutely support training more
doctors and other health professionals but It would be far
more cost effective to expand provision for the two medical
schools we already have.”</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser
at Waikato University Shane Vugler says “Professor Quigley
and the National Party are being very irresponsible with
taxpayer money. There appears to be no detailed costings or
business case for this proposed project. Even National’s
own caucus and ‘finance person’ have expressed doubts
about the credibility of the numbers, yet they still plan to
commit Aotearoa taxpayers to fund it.”</p>

<p>“When
hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent, it’s
important to follow due process in a transparent
way.”</p>

<p>“This is a terrible look for an institution
that is required by law to be the critic and conscience of
society; and centred on evidence-based teaching and
research.”</p>
