         </p><p><br>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
fighting back against continued cuts at Te Kunenga ki
Pūrehuroa | Massey University, as Vice-Chancellor Jan
Thomas today released a proposal to make more devastating
staffing cuts across key subject areas.</p><p>The proposal
would make drastic staff cuts across the languages,
humanities, and social sciences; including halving staff in
Defence &amp; Security Studies, Development Studies, English
&amp; Writing, History, and Politics
Departments.</p><p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Ben Schmidt
describes the proposals as “completely short-sighted and
damaging.”</p><p>"The Massey University Council and Vice
Chancellor should immediately halt all staffing cuts and
engage with the incoming Government about the future of
tertiary education. They need to understand the new
Government's priorities before making such drastic
decisions.</p><p>"It is particularly galling to see Defence
&amp; Security studies in the firing line. Defence Force
personnel based at Linton and Ohakea get significant value
from those courses.</p><p>“Capacity and provision would be
lost in these subjects at a time when our nation is
considering its role in an increasingly unstable world. As a
small trading nation New Zealand needs people who can make
sense of global geopolitics. All the subjects under threat
from this proposal teach skills that are vital to our
economic and strategic future."</p><p>TEU members are
rallying with students against these cuts 12:30PM Wednesday
18 October at the Concourse, Manawatū Campus, Massey
University.</p>
