         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union will
continue to fight back in the wake of more extensive
proposed cuts that were announced at Te Kunenga ki
Pūrehuroa | Massey University today.</p><p>Vice Chancellor
Jan Thomas has unveiled a new proposal to cut staff numbers
by over 60% across the schools of Natural Sciences and Food
and Advanced Technology; and end provision in Auckland for
all courses offered in these areas. Her proposal would also
see the end of Massey University teaching Engineering, Plant
Science and other areas while closing down the Massey Genome
Service and Manawatū Microscopy and Imaging
Centre.</p><p>If confirmed, these proposals will cause over
100 job losses.</p><p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Ben Schmidt
describes the proposals as “outrageous!”</p><p>“Two
weeks out from a general election, with new funding having
been recently committed by the government with the express
intention of stopping this kind of provision loss, and with
a comprehensive review of all tertiary education funding
getting underway, the Vice Chancellor appears determined to
push through her austerity agenda.”</p><p>“The TEU has
always fought hard for equality of access to provision,
wherever it is in Aotearoa a student might live. It’s not
fair to tell ākonga in the Manawatū and surrounding
districts that if you want a career as an engineer you must
leave your home and family and move to another part of the
country. Nor is it good sense to end Natural Sciences and
Food and Advanced Technology provision on the North Shore
– one of Aotearoa’s most populous and fastest growing
areas.”</p><p>“All Vice Chancellors and Chief Executives
of the sector need to stop and wait for the funding review
to run its course before continuing to make short-sighted
decisions such as these
ones.”</p>
