New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations congratulates
the government for the significant tertiary education
funding boost announced in Budget 2023.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei
| National Secretary Sandra Grey says “we see this as the
first sign of genuine recognition of the significant
underfunding that the tertiary education sector has been
grappling with for decades.”</p><p>“The 5% funding boost
announced today should go some way to ensuring students have
access to quality education, provided the institutions
invest in people. Looking long term – we are ready to
talk, as staff and students, to address the historic
underfunding that has destabilised
provision.”</p><p>“With large scale staff cuts already
underway at Otago, imminent at Te Pūkenga and Victoria
University, and expected elsewhere, now is the time for
institutions to re-think plans to cut jobs.”</p><p>In last
year’s budget, the Student Achievement Component (SAC)
funding, which comprises around 75% of income for
universities and other providers, was budgeted to increase
by 1.2% from January 2022 and 2.75% from January 2023 at a
time when inflation was running at 6.9%.</p><p>The
announcement of a 5% increase from 1 January 2024 comes at a
time when inflation remains high at 6.7% after hitting a
thirty year high of 7.3% last June.</p><p>NZUSA National
President Ellen Dixon says “we welcome this budget as a
step in the right direction in that it prioritises
apprentices, trainee teachers and continues to find pathways
for upholding the targeted training and apprenticeship fund
and fees free. We acknowledge the receptiveness that the
government has shown to student campaigns in areas such as
free public transportation, climate, the winter energy
payment and research but the effectiveness of the investment
remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>Te Mana Ākonga Tumuaki Rosa
Hibbert-Schooner says “When we are not investing in
supporting our ākonga of today, their education, their
wellbeing and the environment around them, we are not
actively preparing for building toward a future inclusive of
those it will affect most. Hence we request a commitment
from government to continue engaging with ākonga on the
future of this investment.”</p><p>Lichelle Kerei, TEU Te
Pou Tuarā, notes that “Although the budget 2023
recognises the increase of $225m to properly fund Māori
education and the provision of mātauranga Māori including
Te Reo, the government still have a long way to go towards a
commitment to reflect a Tiriti-centric budget that will
address the massive inequities Māori continue to face in
the sector. We acknowledge that the funding will help
towards supporting mātauranga Māori but the funding gap
between universities and wānanga is not
equitable.”</p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
