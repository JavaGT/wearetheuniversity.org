<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington are
vowing to fight for every job in the wake of today’s
announcement of widespread job cuts. The employer has cited
a drop in enrolments and a resulting budget shortfall as the
cause of up to 260 FTE now facing the axe.</p>

<p>TEU Branch
President Dougal McNeill says “our members no not accept
that cuts of this magnitude are the answer to anything. If
they go ahead, the result will be unhappy students who will
lose their lecturers and supervisors while the standard of
service they get from libraries and administrators will
reduce. Remaining staff will struggle with further increases
to workloads that are already unmanageable.”</p>

<p>“We
will campaign hard to stop these cuts. University
management, government ministers and MPs should be on notice
that our members are not about to go quietly.”</p>

<p>Te
Pou Ahurei Takirua – Ahumahi | Assistant National
Secretary – Industrial Irena Brörens says “while
Victoria University management has been signalling for some
time that cuts are on the way, we are disappointed to see
that the funding boost announced in last week’s Budget has
not made an impact on their plans at a time when Aotearoa is
crying out for more skilled workers.”</p>

<p>“We have
seen time and time again, the impact widespread cuts like
these have on morale of staff and students and the services
the institution exists to provide. Unfortunately this sort
of short term thinking does not turn a struggling entity
around – it’s more likely to do the
reverse."</p>

<p>“We call on Minister of Education Jan
Tinetti, local MP and Finance Minister Grant Robertson, and
Vice Chancellor Nic Smith to think very carefully about the
implications of these cuts and rethink their
plans.”</p><p>
