	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
outraged by a newly released TEC
report (dated 28 July 2023) that signals $52m in new
funding cuts for tertiary institutions that are already
shutting down courses and making staff redundant due to
funding shortfalls.</p><p>TEU’s branch president at one of
the impacted universities, Te Herenga Waka | Victoria
University of Wellington, Dougal McNeill says “we are
shocked to learn that barely a month after the government
announced $128m in additional funding that was supposed to
save courses and jobs, the TEC has seen fit to claw much of
it back from the institutions that needed it
most.”</p><p>“The TEC should be an advocate for and a
champion of the tertiary education sector, but instead all
they seem to do is force institutions to cut jobs and
provision.”</p><p>In response to the report, TEU members
from Victoria University of Wellington and Students Against
Cuts will picket the TEC’s Wellington headquarters, at 44
The Terrace, at 8:15am tomorrow morning.</p><p>Dougal
McNeill says “if the TEC is so keen to see tertiary
education providers cut staff, and cut courses, then they
should see the faces of the people impacted by their
choices. I’ll be there to remind them of the mess
they’ll leave if we’re cut
away.”</p>
