<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa | Massey University are outraged
following yesterday’s release of a “Preliminary
Decision” proposing to cut over 70 jobs from Natural
Sciences, and Food and Advanced Technology – including
axing Massey’s provision of Engineering
entirely.</p>

<p>Vice Chancellor Jan Thomas oversaw the
“preliminary decision” which, if implemented, would also
end provision in Auckland for all courses offered in Natural
Sciences and Food Technology, leaving an $150 million state
of the art science and technology building that fully opened
only a few months ago without a clear
purpose.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Ben Schmidt
describes the proposals as “short sighted and completely
unnecessary,” while members continue fighting back against
the proposed cuts.</p>

<p>“The new Government has stated
they want to build an economy that enables wealth creation,
maximises added value before exporting, invests in IT to
promote economic growth and employment, and ensure high
educational achievement which they say will lead to high
value employment opportunities. Slashing jobs and courses in
sciences and technology is deeply shortsighted and
contradictory to these goals.”</p>

<p>“Food Technology,
Engineering, and Natural Sciences are essential for growing
New Zealand’s economy and to be an attractive and
sustainable tourist destination. Access to studying
Engineering in the Manawatū is also important for regional
economic growth and capacity building.”</p>

<p>“The
university have said the figures used by the TEU members in
their alternate proposal were inaccurate, however these
figures were the ones the university itself supplied and
used to formulate its own proposal. We call for urgent
engagement between Massey University and the TEU to take our
proposal seriously and work together to save
sciences.”</p><p>
