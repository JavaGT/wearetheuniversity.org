<p>The Employment Court has ruled in favour of the Tertiary
Education Union in legal action against Auckland University
of Technology.</p>

<p>The Court found that AUT had failed to
abide by a compliance order issued by the Employment
Relations Authority.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Jill
Jones says “This is a significant victory for the members
of our union. It sends a very clear message that there are
consequences for not abiding by the terms of a collective
agreement.”</p>

<p>She added “As has been clear from the
media coverage, AUT has caused distress to its students and
damage to its own reputation through the poor way it has
treated staff. This was completely unnecessary, and it would
not have happened if AUT had simply followed the collective
agreement and listened to our members in the first
place.”</p>

<p>The Employment Relations Authority
determination had stated that AUT was obliged to identify
positions that “could be determined as surplus” before
applying selection criteria, and that this didn’t happen.
The Authority was clear that “AUT should be asked to go
back and follow the collective agreement
correctly”.</p>

<p>TEU took the matter to the Employment
Court when AUT failed to comply with the order from the
Employment Relations Authority.</p>

<p>The Employment Court
Judge said “the university has, effectively, carried on
the path it set for itself in about September 2022 without
modifying its behaviour to comply with (the collective
agreement)”</p>

<p>AUT has now been fined.</p>
