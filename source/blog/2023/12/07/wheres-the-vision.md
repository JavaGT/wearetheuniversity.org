         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is deeply
concerned for the future of vocational education, in light
of the National government commencing implementation of its
100-day plan commitment to “begin disestablishing Te
Pūkenga”.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra
Grey says “this is a group of staff and students that is
way beyond change fatigued. Our members have been scared for
their jobs for as long as they can
remember.”</p><p>“After years of working for struggling
regional polytechnics that constantly cut courses and
provision, they transferred to Te Pūkenga which for better
or worse has led to enormous restructuring of the entire
sector. Now the new government wants to abandon the hundreds
of millions of dollars of work that has been done with no
plan for what comes next.”</p><p>“We didn’t ask for Te
Pūkenga to be established, and we often disagreed with the
direction it was going in and the adequacy of its
resourcing, but at least there was a vision behind it. What
is Penny Simmonds’ vision for the sector?”</p><p>“This
next round of upheaval will be expensive – it will involve
up to sixteen new layers of management depending on how many
entities Te Pūkenga is replaced with. That’s up to 16 new
Chief Executives and supporting functions which we estimate
will cost taxpayers over $63 million in itself. How does
this square with the government’s avowed commitment to
spending our money wisely?”</p><p>“Then there is the
enormous cost this will continue to have due to staff and
students who are already voting with their
feet.”</p><p>“The minister needs to slow down and talk
this through with the sector before she goes any further or
this will blow up in her
face.”</p>
