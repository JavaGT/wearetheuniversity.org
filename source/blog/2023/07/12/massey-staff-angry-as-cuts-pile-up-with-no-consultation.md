<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa | Massey University are preparing
to fight for every job in the wake of today’s announcement
of further job cuts by Vice Chancellor Jan Thomas.</p>

<p>The
calls for “voluntary enhanced cessation” (voluntary
redundancy) target up to 125 jobs across the Library,
College of Health, and College of Sciences, with the College
of Sciences hit hardest with 90 to 100 jobs on the line. The
announcement comes despite years of ongoing cuts in these
areas preceding the announcement, and the
government’s recent cash injection.</p>

<p>If they
proceed, the cuts will further diminish the University and
further increase unsafe workloads for
staff.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Ben Schmidt describes
the feeling on the ground as one of “devastation and
anger. It is unbelievably short sighted of the Vice
Chancellor to keep slashing jobs across the university when
the government has allocated a significant amount of new
money intended to stop the cuts, along with an upcoming
review of tertiary funding.”</p>

<p>“Jan Thomas has
repeatedly failed to front up and meet with the staff of the
university about this, or provide any clear and transparent
information to justify it. This is a major upheaval and as
such we believe a change proposal should be produced and
staff properly consulted before any decisions are made. As
yet, this has not occurred.”</p>

<p>“The Vice-Chancellor
must immediately stop these cuts, engage with staff, and
work with TEU and the government towards a more constructive
alternative.”</p>
