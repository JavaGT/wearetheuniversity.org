         </p><p>TEU members at Massey University are campaigning to stop
proposed policies that will lead to the closure of courses
and disciplines across the University. This despite the
recent government announcements of increased tertiary
funding.</p><p>The University is proposing to change its
‘No and Low Enrolments Policy and Procedures’, and to
introduce a ‘Digital Plus’ policy which would cut back
teaching of disciplines in-person at campuses.</p><p>Te
Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Ben Schmidt says “if approved, the changes could
see a small group of Senior Leadership Team members deciding
to close down courses and qualifications without consulting
staff or students while drastically shortening the time for
this process. In addition, the ‘Digital Plus’ policy
would see most disciplines only taught in person at one of
the University’s three campuses, with serious impacts for
local communities in Auckland, Wellington, and the
Manawatū.”</p><p>“These proposed policy changes would
diminish the University and its staff as a place of research
and learning for the public good. They must not go
ahead.”</p><p>“TEU members across the University are
concerned these policy changes would lead to large scale
loss of valuable programmes and disciplines from campuses,
with flow on impacts to staff jobs and student access to
education on campuses.”</p><p>“Members are furious at
the lack of transparency and broader consultation about the
policies and their impacts.”</p><p>“The Vice-Chancellor
must immediately halt this process to engage with the union
about a constructive way forward. Staff, students, and the
community must instead be at the heart of all decision
making for the future of the
University.”</p>
