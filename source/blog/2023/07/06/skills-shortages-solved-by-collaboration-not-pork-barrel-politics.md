         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union says a
third medical school at Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato | The
University of Waikato is not an effective way to resolve
either the crisis in tertiary education or the doctor
shortage.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra
Grey says “to make a unilateral decision of where and when
to fund a third medical school in a politicised way without
any meaningful consultation with the medical profession as a
whole or the tertiary education sector is inappropriate and
irresponsible.”</p><p>“This proposal flies in the face
of the growing consensus that universities should be working
together more collaboratively, not continuing down the
failed path of competition and vanity
projects.”</p><p>“What we’ve seen over the last few
weeks is the old model collapsing. Universities, Waikato
included, are running deficits due to a broken funding
system that rewards bad choices to put empire building
before staff and students.”</p><p>“A much more cost
effective and impactful policy solution than this would be
to expand the two medical schools we already have that enjoy
excellent reputations at home and abroad and use the money
that would have been wasted on duplication and $380 million
in capital costs to attract some of the high-quality staff
we have lost back into academia.”</p><p>Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Shane Vugler adds “it’s now plain to see what
a
million dollars in consultancy fees for Steven Joyce has
bought the University of Waikato. It’s disappointing to
see that the Vice Chancellor is choosing to spend time and
resources this way when his staff are overworked and their
salaries are falling further and further behind
inflation.”</p><p>“There are many other important skills
shortages that need addressing such as nursing and teaching.
We should be addressing them holistically with a sector-wide
strategy that puts staff and students at the centre of
decision making, not former National Party ministers and
those wedded to old
thinking.”</p>
