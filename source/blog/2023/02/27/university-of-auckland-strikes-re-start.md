<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education members at
Waipapa Taumata Rau | The University of Auckland will strike
for 23 hours this week. The strike, which will commence at
1.30pm on Wednesday and end at 12:30pm on Thursday, is
expected to cause disruption during the first week of
classes of the academic year.</p>

<p>TEU Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Nicole Wallace says “it gives us no pleasure
that the education of akonga | students is again being
disrupted. However, the employer has demonstrated that they
are otherwise not prepared to meaningfully move on important
issues.”</p>

<p>“UoA is the only university in Aotearoa
that still expects our members to sell away important
conditions such as long service leave and retirement
gratuity, along with the threat of no pay increase for some
colleagues based on an opaque performance pay system – all
in exchange for the same pay increase that has already been
given to non-union members.”</p>

<p>“Despite the
University being well able to afford a real pay rise, the
employer has decided to exploit the current cost of living
crisis by attempting to push through these changes to the
collective agreement.”</p>

<p>In addition, professional
(non-academic) staff have been undertaking a further strike
– a ban on working more than the ordinary hours of work,
defined in the collective agreement – which commenced last
Friday. TEU professional staff at UoA are only contracted
and paid to work 37.5 hours per week, yet this is rarely
adhered to. Many staff say they regularly work between 40
and 50 hours per week.</p>

<p>Nicole Wallace says “we
expect this strike to have a significant impact considering
the enormous amounts of goodwill universities have been
operating on for years with a combination of staff cuts and
COVID causing unsustainable workloads.”</p>

<p>This is the
second time such a strike has been undertaken at University
of Auckland in a dispute that has been ongoing since last
October and it follows in the wake of a strong majority of
TEU members, who attended a stop work meeting on Friday the
17th to discuss slow progress in collective agreement
negotiations, voting to continue their campaign of
action.</p>

<p>Previous strikes in this campaign have
included:</p><ul><li>A half day strike on Thursday 6 October
last year.</li><li>An academic staff ban on entering and
releasing student marks or course marks into any student
management system from 14 November until 8 December last
year.</li><li>A professional staff ban on working more than
the ordinary hours of work, defined in the collective
agreement from 17-24 November last year.</li></ul><p>TEU
members will rally outside the Clock Tower on Princes Street
from 1:30pm onwards on Wednesday and between 11am and 12
midday on
Thursday.</p>
