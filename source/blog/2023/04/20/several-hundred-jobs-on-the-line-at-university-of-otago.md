<p>Hundreds of staff at Te Whare Wānanga o Ōtākou |
University of Otago are bracing themselves for potential
unemployment in the wake of warnings from management that
large scale redundancies are on the way.</p>

<p>In an email
to staff this afternoon, Acting Vice Chancellor Helen
Nicholson said “our current modelling shows that we may
need to lose several hundred FTE over the next 18
months.”</p>

<p>Nicholson’s email states that while
enrolments are only down .9% on last year, university
management had budgeted on enrolment growth. This has left
many staff frustrated that they could lose their jobs due,
in part, to bad forecasting.</p>

Organiser at Otago, Phil Edwards, says “staff cuts are
never a good response to the cyclical fluctuations we always
see in enrolment numbers. Of course when we have low
unemployment, fewer people choose to study. But with
economists predicting an economic downturn in the very near
future, this is the absolute worst time to be cutting the
tertiary education workforce.”</p>

<p>“Much more needs to
be done to ensure these cycles can be ridden out, and a big
part of that is the way tertiary education is funded in
Aotearoa. We don’t think University of Otago management
have done enough to secure the funding they need to deliver
quality public tertiary education that meets the needs of a
country that is crying out for more skilled
workers.”</p>

<p>“We have repeatedly called
on all the Vice Chancellors to work with us and the
government in a tripartite forum to argue for the
university sector our country deserves and would benefit
greatly from. We repeat that call again today, before more
highly valuable staff are forced to walk out the
door.”</p>
