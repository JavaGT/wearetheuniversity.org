<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
disappointed to note today’s media reports that show Te
Whare Wānanga o Waikato | The University of Waikato has
spent almost a million dollars over the last 3 years for
strategic advice from former Minister of Tertiary Education
Steven Joyce</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Shane Vugler is
“appalled nearly a million dollars have been spent on a
single consultant.”</p>

<p>“Over the last three years,
staff at the University of Waikato have faced a policy of
not replacing staff who leave at a time when COVID 19
responses have created more work. Added to this staff have
been forced to accept very low pay rises because the
University was under financial pressure and said they
couldn’t afford to pay them more”.</p>

<p>Vugler notes
that “staff have been doing more with less, while money is
thrown at a political consultant."</p>

<p>“Steven Joyce has
no designated position or role at the University and
doesn’t appear to report or be accountable to anyone, TEU
questions what value paying Steven Joyce a million dollars
has added to the teaching, learning and research outputs of
the University. The University claims that Steven Joyce’s
work has increased its market share of school leavers when
in fact it is largely due to the hard work of a 11 full-time
staff in the Future Students Team and 25 student
ambassadors, mostly employed on the minimum wage, rather
than the part-time advice from Steve
Joyce.”</p>

<p>"Likewise, the University’s claim that
Steven Joyce’s work with the Waikato Management School has
grown the school’s profile and reputation. The reality is
that the WMS has had a strong reputation for decades and
responsibility for enhancing it rests with its PVC Matt
Bolger, not Steven Joyce.”</p>

<p>“The reality is that
the University has paid Steven Joyce almost a million
dollars for a part time advisory role that makes him the
highest paid individualon the university’s books. This
is not acceptable or appropriate when many staff can’t
afford to pay their mortgages or put food on the table due
to pay rises that have not kept pace with
inflation.”</p>

<p>"The Minister of Tertiary Education and
the TEC should carry out an immediate investigation into the
University of Waikato’s use of and payments to independent
contractors."</p>
