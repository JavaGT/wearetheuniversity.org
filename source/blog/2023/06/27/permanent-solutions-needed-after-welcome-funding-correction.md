<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union welcomes
today’s announcement of additional funding for tertiary
education as a victory for the union members who campaigned
hard for the government to step in.</p>

<p>Minister of
Education Jan Tinetti has announced a $128 million package
for the tertiary sector, including Te Pūkenga and wānanga,
however it remains unclear if this will be enough to stop
the cuts currently proposed across the sector. The
government also signalled that a review of tertiary
education funding will take place.</p>

<p>Tumu Whakarae |
National President Dr Julie Douglas says the government’s
decision has come “better late than never. We‘ve been
telling successive governments for over a decade that our
members are at breaking point and something had to give. We
are cautiously optimistic that this will be enough to stop
the cuts but given it is not targeted at the institutions
that are struggling the most, we are concerned the money may
be spread too thin.”</p>

<p>“The staff of our sector have
watched colleagues walk away to other jobs and/or countries,
they have seen the quality of education diminished, they
have survived previous rounds of staff cuts and they have
struggled under intense workloads all due to a lack of
funding where it’s needed most.”</p>

<p>“It’s a
testament to their resilience, persistence and campaigning
strength that they have won this victory, but the mahi
doesn’t end here. We now need to ensure that this money
will be used by the Vice Chancellors to stop the cuts. And
we need to come together as a sector to work on a long-term
fix.”</p>

<p>“The funding model is still not working,
workloads are still unmanageable and university salary
growth is still lagging a long way behind inflation,
overseas institutions, and some industries that our
universities draw staff from.”</p>

<p>“While we
congratulate the government for making a good call today, a
lot of significant challenges
remain.”<br>&nbsp;</p><p>
