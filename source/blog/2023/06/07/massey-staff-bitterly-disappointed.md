           <h1>Massey Staff Bitterly Disappointed</h1>

	 <p>
         </p><p>EU members at Massey University are bitterly disappointed
that the Vice-Chancellor has continued to push ahead with
disruptive and unnecessary plans to disestablish 178
administration and finance jobs only to establish 141 new
roles.</p><p>A preliminary decision was released on Tuesday,
with no substantial changes to the initial proposal despite
overwhelming staff feedback against it.</p><p>TEU Organiser
Ben Schmidt says now is not the time to cut staff.
“Administrative and finance staff are essential to the
smooth running of the University and supporting academic
staff to focus on teaching and research. The
Vice-Chancellor’s preliminary decision will make their
already tough jobs even tougher. The preliminary decision
will negatively impact services to both staff and students
by placing undue pressure on already stretched
workloads.”</p><p>In addition to redundancies, the
proposal would likely see long serving staff lost, major
disruption to the University, and further increases to
workloads of already overworked and under-resourced academic
and general staff. Union members have raised concerns about
the potential health and safety implications of any further
increases to workloads without better
resourcing.</p><p>Schmidt says “The Vice Chancellor must
address this by fronting up to meet with staff and work to
value and invest in the crucial work that administrative
workers
do.”</p>
