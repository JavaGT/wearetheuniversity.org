         </p><p>Victoria University’s Hunter Lawn hosted a passionate
protest this morning, in the wake of an announcement from
Vice Chancellor Nic Smith that 230 jobs are set to be
cut.</p><p>Staff have been anxiously waiting to find out who
would be targeted by cuts that were foreshadowed a month
ago. Today’s announcement confirmed that the cuts target
areas such as languages, secondary school teaching, tourism,
management, geophysics and physical geography. Other
programmes are merging, and 39 general (non-academic) roles
are targeted within the cuts.</p><p>Speaking to the staff
and students rallying to save their jobs this morning, Te
Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union Tumu Whakarae |
National President Dr Julie Douglas said “it is so
short-sighted to diminish staff, programmes and institutions
at a time when our economy is in desperate need of trained
educated workers in every industry.”</p><p>“This is so
much more than just about jobs today – we are talking
about a sector in crisis and on the line is the future of
tertiary education being able to deliver what we need as a
society into the future, the workforce we need in the future
and the needs of a decent society to have educated
citizens.”</p><p>“Future generations of young kiwis
depend on a robust university sector to be there for them
– to be able to follow their passions.”</p><p>After the
rally, Dr Douglas called out the government and Minister of
Education Jan Tinetti for not acting.</p><p>“They don’t
even need to commit money right away, the debt ceiling for
universities could be raised and this would provide a
short-term solution that would then allow the breathing
space to come up with something more
sustainable.”</p><p>“It’s time to get off the fence.
To not act now is to not support tertiary
education.”</p>
