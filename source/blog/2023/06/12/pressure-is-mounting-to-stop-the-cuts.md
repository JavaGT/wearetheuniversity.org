         </p><p>Pressure is mounting on the government to get off the
fence and start acting to stop the cuts that will decimate
the tertiary education sector.</p><p>Yesterday, Te Hautū
Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union joined Otago University
Students Association and Victoria University Students
association to publish an
open letter to the TEC and government calling on them to
save tertiary education in Aotearoa. Since its launch, some
high-profile names have added their support, including
former Prime Minister Helen Clark.</p><p>Meanwhile, a
petition launched last week asking the Government to
urgently provide universities the funds to stop impending
job cuts has already reached 3,000 signatures.</p><p>Tumu
Whakarae | National President Dr Julie Douglas says
“it’s been fantastic to see the widespread support for
our members and the work they do pour in. Students, staff
and the wider public all agree – universities are critical
to the success and prosperity of Aotearoa and the government
must treat them accordingly. They simply cannot sit on the
sidelines and watch as tertiary education shrinks away due
to poor funding.”</p>

<p>“We have been talking to
Minister of Education Jan Tinetti, and our most recent
meeting last Thursday was productive. She is listening to
our calls and taking them seriously but the time for
listening is now over. An immediate funding injection is
needed to halt the job cuts at the universities proposing
these significant reductions. This must then be followed by
a serious discussion about how to fund this sector more
sustainably. We can’t keep shifting the burden of a
history of under-investment onto the shoulders of
individuals and creating this level of uncertainty for both
staff and students.”</p><p>Anyone who wants to support our
campaign to stop the cuts to tertiary education can sign our
petition here, and the
open letter
