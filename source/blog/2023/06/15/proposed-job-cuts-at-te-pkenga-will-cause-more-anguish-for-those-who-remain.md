<p>Today’s announcement that there will be 400 fewer roles
at Te Pūkenga following a fresh round of proposed changes
is yet another blow to an organisation already understaffed
and under resourced.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Daniel
Benson-Guiu says TEU members take no comfort from the
majority of the proposed job losses coming from middle
management. “None of the people whose jobs are proposed
disestablished have been sitting around with nothing to do.
They are all hard working people whose work will have to be
picked up by those who stay behind.”</p>

<p>“Everyone at
Te Pūkenga has spent the past two years working under the
constant threat of restructuring and at the same time they
have been doing the work of others, who have left the
organisation and not been replaced, on top of their already
full time jobs. This can’t continue any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Our members have been increasingly
concerned about Te Pūkenga over a long period of time now.
They were promised a new entity that would deliver better,
more equitable and accessible provision but so far they have
not seen any benefits of the reforms on the ground. This
won’t change until they are allowed to get on with safe,
secure jobs and be happy at work.”</p>

<p>“The
establishment of Te Pūkenga brought with it promises of a
system of vocational education that would do more for our
regions, more for our Māori and Pasifika tauira and more
for our communities. If the ambition of the sector laid out
in the
Te Pūkenga charter is to be realised, the sector will
need more funding.”</p>

<p>“Whenever there are cuts, our
members tell us the effect it will have on their
communities. Our members are passionate, but high workloads
and review after review has left many wondering how much
longer they can go on.”</p>

<p>“Enough is enough, it’s
time for Te Pūkenga management and the government to stop
promising and start delivering for the staff and learners of
Aotearoa’s vocational education
sector.”</p>
