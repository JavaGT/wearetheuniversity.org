	 <p>
         </p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
has been accepted as a member of the Education and Academic
Stakeholder Group (EASG).</p><p>The EASG consists of human
rights-based education and civil society organisations,
academic organisations, and networks that focus on the right
to education, to engage in the monitoring of the
implementation of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Their work recently included
review of SDG 4 “Quality Education” for the High-Level
Political Forum (HLPF). Their participation in United
Nations (UN) processes includes coordinating research-based
advocacy messages, materials and analysis, communication and
media to draw attention to critical education issues, and to
hold governments to account for the recognition of education
as a human right.</p><p>The Group is organised by the Global
Campaign for Education, Education International, the
International Council for Adult Education, the Global
Student Forum (GSF), and the European Students’ Union
(ESU). NZUSA has come on as a new stakeholder alongside a
number ofother democratically-elected student
organisations.</p><p>NZUSA National President, Ellen Dixon,
who holds the international portfolio and is a Steering
Committee Member at the GSF, says:</p><p>“There is a great
need for greater awareness of the issues of violating
education as a human right. Building upon the work that the
EASG has done in 2021 with the HLPF Review of SDG 4, it is
essential that Aotearoa New Zealand and other members of the
Pacific step up to contribute to the conversation on the
SDGs and quality education for all. We need to contribute to
addressing the disruption caused by the pandemic, inequality
and discrimination, the impact of natural disasters and
climate change, holding donor nations to account, the
upholding of academic freedom, and accessibility of digital
tools and technology, to name a few topics.</p>

<p>We as
student unions need to be working closer with education
activists, civil society and other trade unions to uphold
education, to ensure that our voices are being heard at
every level of governance. We should not be divided when we
discuss education as a political topic with the government
of our nation, or the governments of the world. Education is
about our local, national, regional and global community. We
are stronger together.”</p><p>NZUSA will commence as a
member of the EASG as of this month. Ellen plans on being in
New York for the next HLPF following NZUSA’s engagement
with the EASG, to contribute to the conversation on SDG 4 in
the lead up to the UN SDG Summit and the Summit for the
Future in
2024.</p>
