         26 May 2016<br>TEU and NZUSA</p><p>More students but less
money</p><p><br>The overall cut to tertiary education in this
year’s budget will cause real harm to students, their
families, and communities.</p><p>The government has cut the
amount of money to tertiary education and yet it predicts
student numbers will rise.</p><p>The small increases in funding
to areas such as apprenticeships and low-level
qualifications, do not make up for the harm overall funding
cuts are doing to tertiary education.</p><p>NZUSA president
Linsey Higgins says students are currently living in
poverty. </p><p>“Students are living in slums or couch surfing
from friend to friend. Students can't afford to
live.”</p><p>“These cuts will force students to work more
hours. It will stretch them at every point and they will
continue to flood counselling services because they are
exhausted from trying to make it all work.”</p><p>"This budget
is toxic for students. It will stop current and potential
students from accessing education."</p><p>TEU president Sandra
Grey says students’ learning suffers when they are
struggling to pay day-to-day bills. </p><p>“The increase in
students and the cut in funding will be borne by staff
having to do more with less.”</p><p>"Tertiary education staff
have been papering over the gaps caused by underfunding
since 2009, they can't keep making up the shortfall in
funding."</p><p>ends
