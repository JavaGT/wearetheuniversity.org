<p>Helen Kelly, audacious leader</p>

<p><br>Helen Kelly’s vision
for a better New Zealand was simple but audacious. And so
the campaigns she unleashed to bring about that vision were
similarly so.</p>

<p>Kelly, born on suffrage day in 1964,
lifelong resident of Wellington’s Mt Victoria suburb and
lifelong campaigner and union member, died last night from
cancer, aged 52.</p>

<p>TEU members will remember her as the
general secretary of the Association of University Staff
(AUS) between 2002 and 2007.</p>

<p>Prior to that, she learnt her
union skills first as a primary teacher delegate at Johnson
Main School and then as a staff member of the education
union NZEI Te Riu Roa.</p>

<p>There she played an instrumental
role in the nationwide campaign to win primary teachers the
same rate of pay as their secondary teaching colleagues. As
she and tens of thousands of teachers said at the time - a
student’s shoe size should not shape their teacher’s
salary - simple but audacious.</p>

<p>At AUS, Kelly led
nationwide industrial action for all people who work at
universities to have the same employment agreement. She
pointed out that people at universities worked in a global
environment but they were being left behind by overseas
colleagues who were earning significantly more than they
were.</p>

<p>For many people working in New Zealand universities
this was their first experience of either working nationally
for a single goal, or of taking industrial action.</p>

<p>Their
single collective agreement did not eventuate but union
members did force the Labour-led government to set up a
tripartite sector group of employers working people and the
government. The group’s sole purpose was apportioning
government money to lift the salaries of people working in
universities. This it did between 2006 and 2008, until the
new National Party-led government shut it down.<p>

<p>Kelly also
pushed AUS to develop its General Staff Manifesto. This
manifesto became the frame which brought general, allied and
professionals staff into the heart of first AUS and then
TEU.</p>

<p>Kelly was a keen supporter and advocate for the
polytechnic union ASTE and the university union AUS to join
to increase the power of both. She advocated vigorously for
this amalgamation during her time at the head of AUS and led
many of the negotiations that formed TEU.</p>

<p>In 2007, shortly
before the two unions ASTE and AUS officially amalgamated,
working people elected Helen president of New Zealand
Council of Trade Unions</p>

<p>There she led some of her most
memorable campaigns on behalf of working people - standing
up for film makers who had laws passed to strip them of
their employment rights, for farmhands who were being made
to work 60 hours a week for minimum wage, for forestry
workers being killed in horrific health and safety abuses,
and for the families of the Pike River miners.</p>

<p>For eight
years she was the voice of ordinary working New Zealanders.
For the families of those workers whom she was protecting,
she was also the first person to come into their kitchens
and listen to their story rather than tell them how it was
going to be.</p>

<p>Kelly is survived by her husband Steve
Hurring, her mother Cath, brother Max and her son
Dylan.</p>

<p>She will be missed deeply by her friends, fellow
union members and admirers in the Tertiary Education
Union.</p>
