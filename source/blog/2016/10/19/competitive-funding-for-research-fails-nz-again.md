<p>Competitive funding for research fails NZ
again</p>

<p><br>Cutting funding to longitudinal research shows
the government has a basic misunderstanding of the role of
tertiary education, says TEU national president Sandra
Grey.</p>

<p>Grey says by cutting 5000 children from the Growing
Up in NZ longitudinal study the government’s competitive
funding model shows it lacks wisdom or long-term
vision.</p>

<p>The study is New Zealand’s largest longitudinal
study. Based at the University of Auckland, it was meant to
follow 7000 families for the first 21 years of their
children’s lives.</p>

<p>Now, after a funding cut from
government, the study, which has been going for nearly a
decade, will shed 5000 of its 7000 children.</p>

<p>Grey says the
cut is short-sighted and lacking in wisdom.</p>

<p>“Research
like this is crucial to our understanding of our community
and the world we live in.”</p>

<p>“It’s bizarre that such a
study would have to contest for funding half way through its
lifetime. Much of the time and energy researchers have
invested into those 5000 families is now lost.”</p>

<p>Grey
says the government’s competitive funding model for
research does not save money because of all the
administration and bureaucracy costs that go with it, but it
does make it harder for universities to do important,
sustainable, long-term research.</p>

<p>“New Zealand is losing
good research because of blinkered government ideology,”
she
says.</p>
