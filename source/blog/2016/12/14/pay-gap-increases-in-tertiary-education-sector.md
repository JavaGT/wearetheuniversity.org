<p>Pay Gap Increases Between
Highest and Lowest Paid in Tertiary Education
Sector</p>

<p>Figures released yesterday by the State Services
Commission (SSC) provide worrying evidence of a widening pay
gap between the Chief Executives and other staff of Tertiary
Education Institutions (TEI).</p>

<p>The figures contained in the
SSC’s annual Senior Pay Report show that in 2015/16 Chief
Executives received an average pay increase of 2.9% compared
to remuneration received in 2014/15. This compares
unfavourably with an average pay rise of only 1.3% for all
other TEI staff covered by collective agreement.</p>

<p>The
Tertiary Education Union (TEU) is calling on all TEIs to
urgently reduce the gap between the highest and lowest paid
in their workforce and to ensure that, at the very least,
all staff are paid a living wage.</p>

<p>Some of the largest
increases in Chief Executive pay across the tertiary
education sector include:</p>

<p>•         University of
Canterbury – a $100,000 increase compared to remuneration
received by the Chief Executive in 2014/15<br>•        
Waikato Institute of Technology – an pay increase of
$80,000<br>•         Massey University – a pay increase
of $50,000<br>•         Unitec Institute of Technology –
a pay increase of $40,000</p>

<p>Commenting on the SSC’s
figures, National President of the TEU, Sandra Grey, said:
“Chief Executives play a vital role in the running of
Tertiary Education Institutions in New Zealand. However, in
no way does this justify an average pay increase over and
above the rest of the sector’s workforce, without whom the
provision of tertiary education simply would not be
possible.<p>

<p>“The SCC report shows that Chief Executive pay
in the tertiary education sector is increasing at a rate
completely out of step with that of other TEI staff. As
such, the gap between the highest and lowest paid continues
to widen, serving only to increase inequality in the sector.
Th sector-wide pay gap must<p>

<p>"We even have the absurd
situation in TEIs, such at the University of Auckland, where
some staff are denied the living wage whilst the Chief
Executive enjoys a $30,000 pay rise.<p>

<p>“The TEU
challenges all TEIs in future to provide a flat rate pay
increase to all staff, including Chief Executives.”<p>
