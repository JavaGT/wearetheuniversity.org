join us for what promises to be a fascinating day of debate,
art, poetry, music, public lectures and much more.</p><p>A full
list of events happening around the country will be
announced early in the New Year. </p><p>Everyone at the TEU
wishes you a very happy holiday and looks forward to working
with you again in 2017. Tertiary Update will return on 19
