<p>Love Humanities Day of Action</p>

<p>On 22 February 2017, the
Tertiary Education Union will hold a national day of action
highlighting the benefits of teaching and learning
humanities, arts, social sciences and fine arts in New
Zealand.<p>

<p>Centred on a day long “teach-in” at the
University of Otago, TEU members will host a range of
exciting activities across the country.<p>

<p>Events will
highlight the valuable contribution teachers, researchers,
students and graduates of the humanities and other related
disciplines make to New Zealand’s economic and social
well-being.</p>

<p>Please put 22 February in your diaries and
join us for what promises to be a fascinating day of debate,
art, poetry, music, public lectures and much more.</p>

<p>A full
list of events happening around the country will be
announced early in the New Year.<p>

<p>Everyone at the TEU
wishes you a very happy holiday and looks forward to working
with you again in 2017. Tertiary Update will return on 19
January.<p>

<p>Before the summer break, this week's Tertiary
Update recaps the year’s most read stories.<p>
