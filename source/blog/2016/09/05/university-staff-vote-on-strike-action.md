         Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o
Aotearoa<br>5 September 2016</p><p>University staff vote on
strike action</p><p>The Tertiary Education Union members at the
University of Auckland are being asked to decide whether to
take strike action, after three months of negotiations have
failed to see the employer table a pay offer.</p><p>TEU members
at UoA want to see an end to an unpopular performance based
pay system, where only around 9% of workers progress through
the pay structure. They also want to make sure everyone
working at the University earns a Living Wage.</p><p>But TEU
Advocate Enzo Giodani says the most fundamental reason for
the dispute is the University’s steadfast refusal to
genuinely negotiate with union members.</p><p>“This employer
constantly tells us that they are unable to talk to us about
pay until after they set their budgets in October. By then
it’s too late as important funding decisions have already
been made.” </p><p>“Workers expect to be in the mix when
money is being allocated by the university, not after the
fact.”</p><p>Other universities around New Zealand have
similar budget setting processes as the University of
Auckland, but this is the only employer that leaves its
workers out in the cold.</p><p>“All we want as workers is to
negotiate a salary increase. We are not asking for anything
outrageous here, just to be afforded the respect of a
genuine negotiation,” Giordani says.</p><p>The strike ballot
opened on Monday 5 September and will close on Friday 9
September.</p><p>ENDS<br>
