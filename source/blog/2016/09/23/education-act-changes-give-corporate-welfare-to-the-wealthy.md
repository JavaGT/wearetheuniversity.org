         23 September 2016</p><p>Education Act changes give corporate
welfare to the wealthy</p><p><br>Funding private companies the
same as public universities and polytechnics is neither
equitable nor wise, says TEU national president Sandra
Grey.</p><p>The tertiary education minister has announced that
he plans to amend the Education Act so that private
tertiary enterprises (PTEs) will get the same rate of
funding as universities and polytechnics.</p><p>Grey says this
gives the shareholders of those private companies a massive
corporate subsidy that could be better spent on New Zealand
students.</p><p>"Universities and polytechnics are not the same
as private companies. They have a legal duty to teach New
Zealanders of all backgrounds, to protect academic freedom,
and to strengthen our country with strong research."</p><p>"PTEs
only have a duty to return a profit to their shareholders.
Unfortunately, recent fraud cases show that many PTEs are
meeting that duty by teaching their students as cheaply and
quickly as possible."</p><p>Grey says the Tertiary Education
Union opposes to the minister's proposed changes to the
Education Act.</p><p>"We need to protect our public education
system. These changes undermine our public education and
transfer public money to wealthy people who want to get
wealthier."</p><p><br>ends
