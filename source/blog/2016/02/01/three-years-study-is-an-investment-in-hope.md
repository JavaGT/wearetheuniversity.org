<p><strong>Three years study is an investment in
hope</strong></p>

<p>The Labour Party’s ‘three years free’
policy gives people from all walks of life opportunity to
learn, says TEU president Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Grey says the
policy is exciting.</p>

<p>The Tertiary Education Union is
welcoming the new policy, saying it finally recognises that
tertiary education is an investment for the country rather
than a burden.</p>

<p>"Three years of free education is a big
ticket item but it will have an even bigger return for New
Zealanders because they will have the freedom to pursue the
dreams, careers and passions that inspire them," says Grey.
</p>

<p>"It has been a long time since anyone has talked about
investing money in tertiary education for the good of
students, and for the good of people, rather than for the
benefit of business," says Grey.</p>

<p>"This policy will help
people get jobs but it will also help them give back to
their communities and inspire their families."  </p>

<p>"That’s
a big step in the right
direction."</p>
