<p><br>16 February 2015<br>Media release<br>Tertiary Education
Union</p>

<p>Don't sell costly degrees, fix low
incomes</p>

<p><br>Remove money from the equation - education
should be about learning not earning says TEU national
president Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Grey says the release of
Universities NZ's study on graduate earnings tells us what
we already know; that some jobs earn far more than others
do.</p>

<p>"Medicine might be the highest paying profession in
New Zealand but that is the wrong reason for anyone to
become a doctor. We want our future doctors to be passionate
about helping people in need, not helping empty people's
wallets."</p>

<p>Grey says tertiary education contributes to New
Zealand's democracy, stability, social wellbeing and health
outcomes.</p>

<p>"Yet, constantly we tell students to value it
only for its individual economic outcomes."</p>

<p>Universities
New Zealand's study shows that several level 4 and 5 courses
leave graduates worse off financially over their life than
if they had not studied at all.</p>

<p>Grey says that is not a
reflection on the quality of those courses. Rather it shows
the damning effect of user pays education when it clashes
with extremely low paid jobs such as teacher aiding.</p>

<p>"The
solution is not for everyone to avoid studying to become a
teacher aide, but for us to lower the cost of study and
raise wages for people who do such important jobs in our
communities," says
Grey.</p>
