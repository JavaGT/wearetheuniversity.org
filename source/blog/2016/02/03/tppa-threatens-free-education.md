<p><strong>TPPA threatens free education</strong></p>

<p>Tertiary
education staff are calling on the government not to sign
the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) this
week.</p>

<p>TEU's national president Sandra Grey says the secret
agreement will undermine public education.</p>

<p>Trade ministers
from around the Pacific intend to sign the TPPA in
Aucklandtomorrow, Thursday 4 February.</p>

<p>Grey says the
agreement will allow corporations to sue New Zealand when
the government acts in its people's interest but interferes
with corporations' property rights and profitability.</p>

<p>"The
TPPA will limit current and future governments' ability to
make decisions that are the best for our kids' education,"
says Grey.</p>

<p>"The TPPA should explicitly exclude crucial
public services like education but it does not", says Grey.
"This means it threatens things like the Labour Party's
promise to introduce free public tertiary
education."</p>

<p>"Future governments should have the right to
give our kids a free education without fearing they will
need to compensate a private foreign university that has
lost an opportunity to make a profit off our
kids."</p>
