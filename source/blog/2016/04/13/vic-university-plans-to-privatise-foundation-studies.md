<p>Vic University plans to privatise
foundation studies</p>

<p><br>There is no evidence that
privatising Victoria University's foundation studies
programme will bring more international students to
Wellington, says TEU national president Sandra
Grey.</p>

<p>Victoria University has a plan to outsource its
international students foundation studies programme to a
private company. The university is worried that it is not
attracting enough international students through the
programme and has drafted a paper recommending that it close
its in-house programme and contract the work out to an
external company.</p>

<p>Grey says that though the proposal is in
its early stages, it is bizarre.</p>

<p>“It is good that the
university is consulting before it gets to the formal stages
of a change proposal because its current plan lacks evidence
or reason.”</p>

<p>Grey says the plan, which will see an entire
programme closed and outsourced, assumes without evidence
that an as-yet-unnamed private provider will bring in
another 150 international students.</p>

<p>“Why would an
independent company have more success recruiting students
than an internationally regarded university?”</p>

<p>Grey says
TEU rejects the assumption that a private company will be
better either at teaching international students or
attracting them to Wellington than the city's own
highly-regarded university.</p>

<p>“Victoria University's
document cites no evidence or figures. It talks about
international benchmarking figures that we have never heard
of, and dismisses publicly-owned options on the basis of
guesses and
assumptions.”</p>
