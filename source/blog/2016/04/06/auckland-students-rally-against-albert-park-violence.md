         <strong>Auckland Students Rally Against Albert Park
Violence.</strong></p><p>Auckland University Student’s
Association (AUSA) is making a stand against public violence
areas through organising a ‘Reclaim our Park’ rally and
Safety Audit in Albert Park on Friday the 8th of April.
</p><p>The action comes two weeks after two University of
Auckland students were attacked and robbed by a group of
assailants as they walked through Albert Park at about
8.30pm. </p><p>AUSA President Will Matthews said ‘one of the
first things you learn upon arrival at Auckland University
is to stay away from Albert Park in the evening and at
night. It’s well known that it isn’t a safe place to
be’. </p><p>‘We don’t think it’s acceptable anyone
should be so at risk in public places. While everyone has to
exercise a degree of personal responsibility, we have the
right to feel safe in Albert Park’. </p><p>The rally, which
Matthews will speak at alongside MP Jacinda Ardern, Auckland
Councillor Mike Lee, National Women’s Rights Officer Izzy
O’Neill, and a representative of the Chinese Student’s
Association, will also take the form of a safety audit, with
attendees involved in surveying the park on key safety
issues including lighting, visibility and security
presence.</p><p>‘This is a community issue, and we want the
community to be a part of creating the change’ says
Matthews. </p><p><strong>Changing the culture</strong>  
</p><p>Making Albert Park a safer place is about more than just
installing better security features, according to AUSA
Women’s Rights Officers Aditi Gorasia and Diana Qiu.

<p>‘This event, and this campaign is about changing the
entire culture around public safety’ say Gorasia and Qiu.
</p><p>‘We’re getting this culture where victims of assault
are being told that it’s their fault, that they
shouldn’t be walking in Albert Park in the evening. That
kind of victim blaming is the wrong approach - we should be
looking at addressing the root cause of the problem’.
</p><p>‘People won’t feel safer in Albert Park overnight.
This is the beginning of a long process to create a culture
change and make Auckland a safer place for all’.
</p><p><strong>The ‘Reclaim Our Park’ rally and safety audit
will begin at 7pm at the Albert Park rotunda. Media and all
members of the public are encouraged to attend. Further
