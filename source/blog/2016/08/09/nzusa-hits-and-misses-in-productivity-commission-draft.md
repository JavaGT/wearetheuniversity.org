         NZUSA: Hits and Misses in Productivity Commission
Draft</p><p><br>The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations
today welcomes the release of the Productivity Commissions
long-awaited draft report. While there are some highlights,
and the Commission has clearly listened to submitters on
problems and barriers within the system, NZUSA feels that
some of the Commission’s suggestions and recommendations
may actually exacerbate the problems. NZUSA is opposed to
the addition of interest on student loans. </p><p>"We know that
women and other primary caregivers are take years longer to
repay their loans when interest is applied. An interest
bearing loan system also results in these people paying more
than those who don't take out of the workforce. While New
Zealand’s wages remain low, and the return to tertiary
education so poor any loans scheme will require a
significant subsidy if it is to encourage access" says NZUSA
President Linsey Higgins. </p><p>"This move is promoted by the
Commission to remove barriers to education yet we know that
interest will increase barriers. What we need is free
tertiary education. Tertiary education looks dramatically
different to what it did 30 years ago and it encompasses the
university student to the apprentice builder. Entering a
career in 2016 is incredibly difficult without some post
secondary education so we should start treating tertiary
like the new compulsory education and fund it
appropriately."</p><p>"We are supportive towards the idea of
students having greater flexibility to move between
institutions. Study should be able to move with a student
and their life needs, rather than penalise them by not
acknowledging prior study. We applaud the Scottish model
where all local polytechnics are required to have
articulation agreements with a university."

<p>NZUSA is
hesitant about giving students a large sum of money to chose
their education pathway, which looks like privatisation.</p><p>
"We believe that students should instead be regarded as
experts in learning and heard and heeded at all levels of
tertiary institutions. If students are given an education
grant and poor careers advice and poor student voice systems
still exist, then these students are unlikely to make
decisions that will ultimately be in their own interests or
those of society. It will also make institutions extremely
vulnerable, which is also not in students’
interests."</p><p>"Ultimately, NZUSA believes there is some good
elements to this draft document but are deeply concerned by
others. There are some further areas which deserve
investigation and can be made good. We will continue to work
with the Productivity Commission to work towards a final
report that meets the best interests of
students."</p><p>ENDS<br>
