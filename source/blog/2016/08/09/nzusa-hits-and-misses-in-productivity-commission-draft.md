<p>NZUSA is
hesitant about giving students a large sum of money to chose
their education pathway, which looks like privatisation.</p>

<p>
"We believe that students should instead be regarded as
experts in learning and heard and heeded at all levels of
tertiary institutions. If students are given an education
grant and poor careers advice and poor student voice systems
still exist, then these students are unlikely to make
decisions that will ultimately be in their own interests or
those of society. It will also make institutions extremely
vulnerable, which is also not in studentsâ€™
interests."</p>

<p>"Ultimately, NZUSA believes there is some good
elements to this draft document but are deeply concerned by
others. There are some further areas which deserve
investigation and can be made good. We will continue to work
with the Productivity Commission to work towards a final
report that meets the best interests of
students."</p>
