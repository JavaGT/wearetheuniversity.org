<p>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o
Aotearoa<br>9 August 2016</p>

<p>School kids will miss out under
bulk funding</p><p>The government’s global funding plans
for primary and secondary schools could force class sizes to
rise, says TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>Riggs says
TEU supports the Better Funding campaign that fellow
education unions NZEI and PPTA launched today.</p>

<p>“We know
from tertiary education, that when polytechnics with limited
money are forced to make choices between having enough
teachers and paying for other basic running costs, students
lose out.”</p>

<p>“It will be the same in schools,” says
Riggs.</p>

<p>Riggs says bulk funding drives up class sizes and
creates an incentive for boards to choose cheaper options
rather than better education.</p>

<p>“We support our primary
and secondary education colleagues because we already know
what bulk funding is like. Bulk funding has failed in the
past and it will fail
again.”</p>
