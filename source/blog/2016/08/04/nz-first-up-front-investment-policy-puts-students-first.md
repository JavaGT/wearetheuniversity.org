<p>
    NZ First Up Front Investment Policy Puts Students
    First</p>
<p>Sept 3</p>
<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
    Associations (NZUSA) warmly welcomes the Up Front Investment
    policy announcement by Tracey Martin and New Zealand First
    at their conference today. This policy transforms a
    student’s financial debt into a skills debt which would be
    paid off by working in New Zealand for the same number of
    years that one studied. </p>
<p>NZUSA is pleased to see another
    political party taking the issue of student debt seriously.
</p>
<p>“We know Tracey and NZ First are committed to
    addressing the barriers that student loans create while
    balancing the obligation that graduates have to the country
    that has educated them” says NZUSA President Linsey
    Higgins. </p>
<p>“We know Tracey and the NZ First team have
    spent months working on a robust and fiscally sound policy
    that addresses the impacts of student debt and builds on
    previous policies from the party’s manifesto.”
</p>
<p>“Student debt is currently impacting on people’s
    ability to start families, buy houses and prepare for
    retirement.” </p>
<p>“Significant variances in course costs
    and graduate wages can see some of our most important
    members of society such as nurses and teachers left with the
    burden of debt for longer. This policy treats all graduates
    as equal. One year’s study equals one year of skills
    commitment.” </p>
<p>“If implemented, this policy would be a
    game changer for students”. </p>
<p>“While we celebrate this
    policy announcement, NZUSA is committed to working with all
    political parties to ensure the best outcomes for tertiary
    students”. <br>
