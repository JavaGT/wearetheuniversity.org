<p>“Bonding
    in exchange for student loan repayment assistance is an
    issue that we will be asking students about when we visit
    campuses over the latter half of this year.”<p>

<p>“We
    would also like to acknowledge other parties who have
    already made commitments to similar schemes, including New
    Zealand First.”<p>

<p>“Finally we look forward to the
    opportunity to explore this issue further with the Labour
    Party, and other parties, in order to identify the groups,
    and occupations, who may benefit significantly by this idea
    and could be addressed as a matter of priority. We naturally
    would also seek to incorporate the voices of students.”<p>
