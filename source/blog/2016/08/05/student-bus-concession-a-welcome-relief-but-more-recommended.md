<p>Higgins acknowledged that the announcement
is an important first step NZUSA, and encourages this (and
all) regional councils to implement a strategy that allows
for the implementation of free transport for all tertiary
students in their region.<p>

<p>“Free public transport breaks
down one of the barriers that stops students getting to
their classes. If we can break down these barriers we will
give students a greater opportunity to succeed at a higher
level and be better prepared graduates.”<p>
