         <strong>University of Auckland Council to vote on fossil
fuel divestment</strong></p><p></p><p>The University of Auckland
could decide to divest its endowment funds from fossil fuel
investments following a motion put forward for the upcoming
University Council meeting on June 13th. </p><p>Students, staff
and alumni have been urging the university to block
investments in oil, gas and coal companies for the last year
and a half because of moral concerns about funding climate
change.</p><p>Auckland University Students’ Association
President Will Matthews, who put forward the motion to the
agenda and who sits on the University Council, said that
divestment was a critical step for the University to take to
align its investments with its values.</p><p>“If the
University of Auckland takes climate change seriously then
it should put its money where its mouth is and divest from
fossil fuel industries.”</p><p>“Dozens of leading
universities around the world such as Yale, Glasgow and
Australian National University have taken moves to divest
from fossil fuels. This is an important opportunity for us
to take leadership on sustainable investment.”</p><p>The
divestment campaign started on campus by student group
Fossil Free UoA has garnered support from over 2800 staff,
students and alumni who signed their petition calling for
the establishment of an ethical investment policy. Currently
the University Foundation’s lack of such a policy allows
it to invest in other taboo industries such as tobacco and
munitions.</p><p>2016 Young Alumna of the Year Dr Divya Dhar, in
her statement of support for the cause, said: “climate
change is a tragic reality for all of us, especially those
that have and will become climate refugees. It is paramount
that our university becomes a bastion of hope, in correcting
this wrong, and building a sustainable fossil fuel free
future.”</p><p>AUSA and Fossil Free UoA will be holding a
rally before the University Council meeting to show the
Council members that fossil fuel divestment has the support
of the University community.</p><p>Said Matthews: “We owe it
to the donors whose funds we are stewarding for the future
that their money is not being used to fund climate
change.”</p><p>ENDS
