<p>Auckland University Students’ Association celebrates 125th
birthday</p>

<p>June 24 th 2016 is a special day for Auckland
University Students’ Association – it’s the day it
turns 125.</p>

<p>Says AUSA President Will Matthews: “On the
24th of June 1891, 27 Auckland students and graduates met to
discuss growing concerns over a lack of a communal spirit as
well as social and cultural life, with no organised voice or
official representation in college affairs.</p>

<p>125 years
later the organisation that they founded is alive and well,
and fighting every day to make the University of Auckland a
more interesting, vibrant, safe and supportive space for
everyone in it.”</p>

<p>Two fundamental aspects to AUSA have
been the fight for control of student-controlled spaces for
the benefit of students, and increasing student
representation and voice within the University and the wider
community. Since that day in 1891, the student-led Executive
of AUSA has been at the forefront of some of the most
well-known social movements in the history of New Zealand,
organising large numbers of students to march against the
Vietnam War, the 1981 Springbok Tour and in favour of a
nuclear-free New Zealand.</p>

<p>AUSA railed against the reforms
to the tertiary education system in the 1990s, establishing
an Education Action Group that organised thousands-strong
marches up Queen Street, bus trips to Parliament and
occupations of the University Registry to demand a return to
a fairer, more affordable system for students.</p>

<p>AUSA has
also made a major contribution to the social and cultural
life of Auckland. The Association owns 95bFM, a radio
station that began as ‘Radio Bosom’, a pirate station
operating out of Auckland Harbour, which has now grown to
become an iconic part of Auckland’s music scene. It also
owns Shadows Bar, which for decades has provided students
with a friendly and affordable environment to take a break
from their studies.<p>
<p>Today, AUSA supports Auckland students
through a comprehensive welfare system and a large Student
Advice Hub providing free confidential legal advice to
students struggling with anything from tenancy issues to
StudyLink funding problems. It also enriches the campus
experience through a large portfolio of events, including
‘Orientation in the Park’ - a week long festival held in
Albert Park. Student representatives from AUSA are present
at all levels of the University, making sure that every
decision made in each corner of the University serves
students first and foremost.</p>

<p>The political spirit of AUSA
has persisted into the era of legislated Voluntary
Membership of Students’ Associations. In 2016 AUSA has
successfully campaigned to increase awareness around safety
in Albert Park and rallied to urge the University of
Auckland to consider fossil fuel divestment. The Association
considers taking a strong principled stance against
continuous fee rises to be a cornerstone of its duty to
students, and organises against these increases each
year.</p>

<p>“125 years on, AUSA is alive and well” says
President Will Matthews.</p>

<p>“We are incredibly proud of the
legacy that we have inherited, and we do not take it
lightly.</p>

<p>We, and every Executive that comes after us, has
a duty to ensure that the spirit of AUSA endures for another
125 years and beyond, and I am confident that the future for
Auckland students is bright”.</p>

<p>AUSA will be celebrating
this milestone with alumni and key stakeholders from the
University of Auckland and related organisations at the Fale
Pasifika on the 17th of August, and will be also be running
commemorative events for current
students.</p>
