<p>Waikato rally aims to end cuts</p>

<p><br>People who
work and study at the University of Waikato are rallying in
black tomorrow afternoon to prevent cuts to their courses
and jobs.</p>

<p>TEU's deputy secretary Nanette Cormack, who will
be speaking the rally, says the cuts are widespread.</p>

<p>The
university wants to cut the jobs of more than 20 people at
the Faculty of Education. These people help new teachers
learn the skills they need to teach our young
children.</p>

<p>"The university wants to cut the programme that
teaches our new teachers."</p>

<p>The University of Waikato plans
to sell off its Pathways College to a multinational company.
People working at Pathways help hundreds of school leavers
get the foundation skills they need to go to
university.</p>

<p>The university also wants to cut jobs for
telephonists and engineering staff.</p>

<p>Cormack says the
university needs to hear from local people that these cuts
are unnecessary, unwanted and unhelpful.</p>

<p>"We know that the
people of Hamilton and the Waikato do not want these cuts to
their university."</p>

<p>Rally details<br>Venue: University of
Waikato Village Green (beside the shops)<br>Date: Wednesday
