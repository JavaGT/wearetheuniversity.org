<p><strong>People in casual jobs need govt to save their
holiday pay</strong></p>

<p>It is likely that thousands of people
working in universities, polytechnics and wānanga have had
holiday pay taken from them, says TEU national secretary
Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>The government needs to act, she says, to
remove the six-year time limit on employers’ duty to keep
payroll records.<p>

<p>Without those records, people may lose
the chance to get their holiday pay back while they wait for
employers and the government to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Riggs
says many payroll services in tertiary education
institutions are likely to have flaws in their systems that
short-change working people of their holiday pay.<p>

<p>People
working irregular hours or whom claim allowances for working
outside their usual hours are most likely to have lost
holiday pay. For people working at universities,
polytechnics and wānanga this could include many casual
employees such as tutors, administrators, technicians and
librarians.</p>

<p>“Some of these working people with casual
and insecure jobs are the people who most need their bosses
to pay them fairly. They need government to ensure that they
will not be short-changed.”</p>

<p>Riggs says the government
has known about this problem for nearly two years before it
made it public. It estimates that New Zealanders could have
lost over $2 billion of holiday
pay.</p>
