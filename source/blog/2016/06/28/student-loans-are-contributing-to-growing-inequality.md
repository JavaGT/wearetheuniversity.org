         Student loans are contributing to growing
inequality</p><p>Student loans are contributing to growing
inequality, says TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p><p>Statistics New Zealand released data
today showing that the top ten percent of households now
own over half of the country’s total wealth.</p><p>The data
shows extreme inequality between ethnicities. People of
European ethnicity had a median net worth of $114,000,
compared with $23,000 for people of Māori ethnicity,
$12,000 for Pacific people, and $33,000 for the Asian ethnic
group. </p><p> Riggs says part of the cause for this
destabilising inequality is student loans. </p><p>Young people
(aged 15–24) had the lowest individual median net worth of
any age group – just $1,000. The most common debt for
young people is education loans.</p><p>Riggs says student loans
place huge financial pressure on people on low incomes.
</p><p>“It is much harder for non-Pākehā people to grow
their wealth during their life when they are saddled with
debt liabilities that cut away such a huge proportion of
their current wealth.</p><p>“The high cost of studying also
means it is harder for Māori and Pasifika people to get a
tertiary education.”</p><p>Median education loan liabilities
are only one-tenth of Pākehā people’s median assets, but
they are a quarter of Māori people’s assets and over a
third of Pacific people’s assets (table 7.01).</p><p>The data
shows that the households with the smallest median net worth
have the largest median education loans (table 2.02). These
loans make up nearly a quarter of their total debt (table
2.03).</p><p>Over a third of households within the poorest
quintile of net worth have education loans, whereas less
than a tenth of households in the wealthiest quintile have
education debt (table 2.04).</p><p>Riggs says New Zealand has to
cut the cost of education if it wants to restore a more
equal and balanced society.
