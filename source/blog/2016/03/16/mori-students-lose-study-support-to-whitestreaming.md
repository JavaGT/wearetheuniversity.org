<p><strong>Māori students lose study support to
whitestreaming</strong></p>

<p>A report into whitestreaming
reveals that every university in New Zealand, most
polytechnics and even one wānanga have cut jobs that
support Māori students.</p>

<p>TEU will launch the report in
Gisborne on Saturday 19 March at a nationwide
hui.</p>

<p>Whitestreaming is replacing specialist Māori jobs
and services with generalist ones. For instance,
whitestreaming is replacing a specific Māori academic
support officer who provides academic support and pastoral
care to Māori students with a general support officer who
helps all students.</p>

<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey is
calling for an immediate end to the job cull.</p>

<p>“No
further Māori jobs should be cut. No further Māori
students should lose their support services. Every
institution should restore the positions they have cut. And
the government must restore the equity funding that made
these positions possible in the first place.”</p>

<p>TEU’s Te
Tumu Arataki (Māori vice-president) James Houkāmau says
the report is an indictment on New Zealand’s commitment to
Māori students.</p>

<p><br>“Whitestreaming doesn’t just
affect Māori who lose their jobs - it undermines kaupapa
Māori teaching, course content and programmes. Our
institutions have failed to invest in their Māori students
and they’re neglecting their duties under Te Tiriti o
Waitangi.”</p>

<p>TEU is launching its Project Whitestreaming
report and recommendations at:</p>

<p>•	TEU
Hui-ā-Motu</p>

<p>•	Whatukura, EIT Tairāwhiti campus,
Gisborne</p>

<p>•	19 March
