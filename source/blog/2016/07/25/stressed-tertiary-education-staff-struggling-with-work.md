<p><strong><i>Stressed tertiary education staff struggling with
work</i></strong></p>

<p>People working in universities,
polytechnics and wānanga are stressed about their future,
according to a new survey by the Tertiary Education
Union.</p>

<p>TEU president Sandra Grey says the survey of over
1000 people working in tertiary education shows seven out of
ten of them believe their wellbeing is worse than it was ten
years ago.</p>

<p>Grey unveiled the statistics at a symposium the union is hosting on
innovation and productivity in tertiary education.</p>

<p>Job
related stress is growing she says.</p>

<p>In a similar survey in 2013, people
working in tertiary education stated the mean level of
stress they felt in their job was 6.14 out of 10 -
significantly higher than the national average of 5 to 5.5.
This year, the mean workplace stress level for people
working in tertiary education had risen sharply to 7 out of
10.</p>

<p>Grey says the survey shows that people working in
tertiary education are feeling the pressure of constant
restructuring and budget cuts.</p>

<p>“The data shows people
who work in tertiary education are facing bigger workloads,
longer working hours, and larger class sizes. But they are
also stressed because they have no influence over the
decisions that affect them and their students. No one is
listening to
them.”</p>
