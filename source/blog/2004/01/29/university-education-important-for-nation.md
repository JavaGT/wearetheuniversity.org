<p>Association of University Staff - Media Release</p>

<p>University education important for
nation</p>

<p>University education and research are vitally
important to the development of New Zealand's future
economic and social development according to the Association
of University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>AUS National President, Dr Bill
Rosenberg, has raised concerns about a media release from
the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) this week in which
the TEC Chair, Dr Andrew West encouraged secondary school
students and their parents to view a study path which leads
into vocational, instead of academic education.<p>

<p>Dr
Rosenberg said he found Dr West's logic extraordinary when
he said that "having a high percentage of the population
with degrees does not necessarily lead to increased economic
prosperity" in his call for increasing the vocational skill
mix in education.<p>

<p>"This misses the real point which is
that economic prosperity is most unlikely without high
numbers of our population being educated to degree level",
said Dr Rosenberg.</p>

<p>"Dr West has obviously overlooked that
universities produce New Zealand's doctors, dentists,
engineers, scientists and entrepreneurs, all of whom
contribute directly to New Zealand's economic growth," he
said. "In addition university graduates greatly strengthen
New Zealand's public service, social and cultural
environment, and there is increasing international evidence
that economic development falters without this underpinning.
Similarly, university research is fundamental to economic
development and is consistent with the Government's
focus."<p>
<p>"Relative to other countries, New Zealand still
has a low percentage of university qualified people in its
workforce," said Dr Rosenberg. "Only 14 per cent of our
workforce has a university qualification, compared to 19 per
cent of the Australian workforce". (OECD data 2001)<p>

<p>Dr
Rosenberg said that he while he agreed it is essential that
our tertiary education system provides for a wide range of
educational and training needs and that vocational education
should be more respected as an option than is currently the
case, "the TEC would be better employed promoting the whole
the whole of the tertiary sector. These statements raise
concerns that it does not have an even-handed view," he
said.</p>
