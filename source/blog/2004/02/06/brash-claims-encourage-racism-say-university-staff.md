         Association of University Staff - Media Release</p><p>Thursday,
5 February 2004</p><p>Brash claims encourage racism say
university staff</p><p>Claims by National Party leader, Don
Brash that Maori receive additional race-based leave
arrangements encourage employers to be racist, the
Association of University Staff (AUS) said today. Dr. Brash
had claimed that new holidays legislation will give some
Maori "unlimited tangi leave" and discourage employers from
hiring Maori staff.</p><p>AUS National President Dr Bill
Rosenberg said that bereavement and tangihanga leave
arrangements are common in both the public and private
sectors and allowed all employees, irrespective of race, to
have extended bereavement leave where a genuine need
exists.</p><p>Dr Rosenberg said many employees required
additional leave because of family or blood ties to a
deceased person, or because of particular cultural
requirements including, but not limited to, attendance at
all or a part of a tangihanga or its equivalent.  </p><p>The new
Holidays Act does not give unlimited tangihanga leave, nor
does it give special privileges to Maori. It gives the same
rights to all. </p><p> "Dr Brash is simply wrong on this and has
attempted to beat-up an issue upon which there is no
foundation,' said Dr Rosenberg. "His comments encourage
racist behaviour by employers".</p><p> "Many of our members are
from overseas and may need extended bereavement leave on the
death of close relatives in their country of birth. Is Dr
Brash also suggesting that employers should not employ
world-class experts from other countries, or immigrants in
general?" </p><p> "Dr Brash's comments are ill-considered and
dangerous. They are also designed to support the opposition
of employer organisations to the new Holidays Act, based on
misinformation," he said.</p><p>Ends</p><p>
