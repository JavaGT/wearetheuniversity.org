<p><br>Brash claims on university preference wrong say
university staff</p>

<p>Claims by National Party leader Don Brash
that New Zealand universities have lowered their standards
to enable Maori students to graduate are simply wrong says
the Association of University Staff.</p>

<p>Dr Brash told
Television One news yesterday that Maori New Zealanders are
sometimes put into positions which they're not well
qualified for, and asserted that non-Maori would think Maori
graduates were incompetent on the basis of race.</p>

<p>AUS
National President Dr Bill Rosenberg said there was
absolutely no evidence to support Dr Brash's claim that
standards for degree programmes varied according to race.
"While Maori students may be encouraged into some courses,
such as law, through entry quotas, they still had to attain
the same academic standards as their peers to progress in
their study and to graduate with degrees," he said. "Maori
students earn their degrees in exactly the same manner as
their non-Maori counterparts, and using the same assessment
standards".</p>

<p>"Dr Brash's comments follow similarly
inaccurate statements made recently about Tangihanga leave,
and appear designed to encourage negative and racist
attitudes toward Maori", said Dr Rosenberg. "Dr Brash's
comments are ill-considered and dangerously divisive".<p>

<p>Dr
Rosenberg also expressed concern that Dr Brash said he would
not fund universities with racial quotas. Universities are
already underfunded by comparison to their overseas
counterparts and he questioned whether Dr Brash would attach
other poorly considered conditions to funding if given the
opportunity.
