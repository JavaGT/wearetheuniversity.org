         Tuesday, 8 June 2004</p><p>Negotiations fail, industrial action
to continue at Victoria University</p><p>General (non-academic)
staff at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) will
continue with industrial action in support of a claim to
increase salaries by 4%.</p><p>Negotiations between the
Association of University Staff (AUS) and the employer took
place on Thursday 3 June following strike action by AUS
general staff on Monday 31 May. A revised offer of 2.5% plus
a one-off payment of $350 to union members-only, made by the
employer, was rejected at the negotiations.</p><p>AUS general
staff spokesperson Tony Quinn said that the current salary
offer from VUW was still the lowest offer made to any group
of university staff in New Zealand in the current wage
round. He said the revised offer was insufficient to be
attractive to staff.</p><p>"Very little has changed as a result
of negotiations; the offer is still low, and is still
significantly short of what has been offered to academic
staff at VUW," said Mr Quinn. "As a result of Monday's
strike, feeling among the staff is high, and insubstantial
offers only anger members more."</p><p>"The employer's message
is clear; it says that the University believes general staff
are not worth any more than 2.2%." said Mr Quinn. "The
University has not argued that it cannot afford to pay;
rather, it has elected to show it believes general staff are
worth less than their academic counterparts by changing its
offer only by a small amount."</p><p>Starting from tomorrow, the
industrial action will include a number of activities
including non-cooperation, a partial withdrawal of labour,
and unannounced strike action in selected areas.</p><p>Union
members will meet again on 16 June to consider further
action.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
