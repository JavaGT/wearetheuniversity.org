at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) will continue
with industrial action in support of a claim to increase
salaries by 4%.</p>

<p>Negotiations between the Association of
University Staff (AUS) and the employer took place on
Thursday 3 June following strike action by AUS general staff
on Monday 31 May. A revised offer of 2.5% plus a one-off
payment of $350 to union members-only, made by the employer,
was rejected at the negotiations.</p>

<p>AUS general staff
spokesperson Tony Quinn said that the current salary offer
from VUW was still the lowest offer made to any group of
university staff in New Zealand in the current wage round.
He said the revised offer was insufficient to be attractive
to staff.</p>

<p>“Very little has changed as a result of
negotiations; the offer is still low, and is still
significantly short of what has been offered to academic
staff at VUW,” said Mr Quinn. “As a result of Monday's
strike, feeling among the staff is high, and insubstantial
offers only anger members more.”</p>

<p>“The employer’s message
is clear; it says that the University believes general staff
are not worth any more than 2.2%.” said Mr Quinn. “The
University has not argued that it cannot afford to pay;
rather, it has elected to show it believes general staff are
worth less than their academic counterparts by changing its
offer only by a small amount.”<p>
<p>Starting from tomorrow, the
industrial action will include a number of activities
including non-cooperation, a partial withdrawal of labour,
and unannounced strike action in selected areas.</p>

<p>Union
members will meet again on 16 June to consider further
action.</p>
