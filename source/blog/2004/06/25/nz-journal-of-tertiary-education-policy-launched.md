         Association of University Staff - Media Release<br>
Thursday, 24 June 2004</p><p> Academic journal launched</p><p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has launched an
electronic journal, The New Zealand Journal of Tertiary
Education Policy - Nga matauranga hikohiko o Aotearoa, which
is intended to provide a forum within which issues
concerning tertiary education in Aotearoa/New Zealand can be
identified, discussed and debated.</p><p>The journal's Executive
Editor, Neville Blampied, says that since "Learning for
Life", in 1989, tertiary education in New Zealand has
experienced fifteen years of constant re-examination and
review - the Green paper, the White paper, the four reports
of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission - as well as
many other policies and proposals.</p><p>"Shifts in policies
have had major effects on students, on staff and on the
character and operations of tertiary education institutions
themselves, sometimes for the better, often for the worse,"
said Mr Blampied. "Policy development and implementation
have run well ahead of analysis, critique and
evaluation."</p><p>AUS has supported the development of the new
journal because it is committed to improving and sustaining
a quality higher education sector for New Zealand, and
because part of its mission is to help formulate policy and
assist union members in their role as critic and conscience
of society.</p><p>The first issue of the Journal features
articles by former AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan,
The Tertiary Education Strategy and the will to know, and an
investigation of university research by Auckland University
of Technology academic, Keith Rankin, entitled Where Gift
and Market Economics Meet.
</p>
<p>The next issue will be
published in the last quarter of 2004, and is planned to
have a focus on the Performance-Based Research Fund and its
future implications and effects.</p><p>The journal, with full
editorial details, can now be viewed on line at:
