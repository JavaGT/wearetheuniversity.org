	 <p>
         Thursday, 17 June 2004</p><p>"First-week shutdown" planned at
Victoria</p><p>General (non-academic) staff at Victoria
University of Wellington (VUW) have approved a comprehensive
campaign of industrial action aimed at completely shutting
down the administration of the university for the first week
of its second teaching trimester which begins on 12
July.</p><p>General staff at VUW have rejected a pay offer of a
2.5% increase with an additional $350 one-off payment, and
are seeking a 4% increase in line with their academic
colleagues.</p><p>The plan of action, entitled "first-week
shutdown" will comprise a comprehensive build-up of action
including a communications black-out, withholding exam
grades and refusing to process enrolments. That will be
complemented with rolling strike action (or lightning
strikes), and sustained strike action in selected key
areas.</p><p>Academic staff have promised that they will provide
financial and practical support for the
action.</p><p>Association of University Staff (AUS) general
staff spokesperson, Tony Quinn, said general staff at VUW
did not accept the Vice-Chancellor's view that they are
worth less than those at other universities around the
country. "All others have been offered a salary increase of
at least 3%," he said. "That is why we have had to adopt a
plan of action that will, unfortunately, go beyond the usual
protest and result in serious and sustained
disruption."</p><p>"General staff at VUW will not be categorised
as second-class employees by accepting lower salary
increases than everywhere else in the sector," said Mr
Quinn. "We will be asking students and the public to support
us by encouraging the Vice-Chancellor to give general staff
the salary recognition (and dignity) they deserve."</p><p>Mr
Quinn said that informal discussions would continue with the
University in the hope that agreement could be reached
before the July disruption.</p><p>ENDS</p><p></p><p></p><p>
