<p>Thursday, 3 June 2004</p>

<p>Academic and general staff at the
University of Otago walked off the job this afternoon in
protest at salary offers made by the University to renew
collective employment agreements. More than 400 staff took
part in a protest march at the University, culminating in a
walk through the library which was being kept open by the
University's Director of Human Resources.</p>

<p>Non-clinical
staff at the Otago Schools of Medicine in Wellington and
Christchurch also took strike action this afternoon. The
decision to take industrial action came after a failure to
reach agreement between the unions and University in
negotiations to renew the two collective employment
agreements.</p>

<p>The unions are claiming a 4% salary increase,
backdated to 1 February. In response, the University is
offering a 3% salary increase, from 1 May, to general staff
and academic staff below the rank of lecturer, and a
restructuring of the salary scales for lecturer and above.
This would result in salary increases of between 3.5% and
4.8%, and remove some steps from the salary scales.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the combined university unions,
Association of University Staff (AUS) Otago Branch
President, Dr Shef Rogers, said that the unresolved issues
centred on differential pay offers, backdating, and the
overall level of the pay increase offered. Dr Rogers said
the attitudes of the parties had hardened after the
Vice-Chancellor, Dr Graeme Fogelberg, emailed staff directly
outlining the offer and implying that the unions had not
accurately reported it. He said that a number of staff
believed that the Vice-Chancellor's action was unnecessarily
provocative in the current industrial climate.<p>
<p>This
afternoon the University sent an email to striking union
members suspending them, advising that pay would be deducted
for the duration of the strike action. It follows earlier
suspension notices sent yesterday, but which were
invalid.</p>

<p>At meetings held earlier in the week, Otago
staff gave the unions' bargaining team power to call further
"rolling action", including withholding exam marks.</p>

<p><br>The unions have advised the University that they remain
open to negotiation and prepared to engage in mediation. The
University has declined mediation.</p>

<p>ENDS</p>
