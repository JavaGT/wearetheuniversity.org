	 <p>
         Don’t increase student fees at Victoria, says staff union 
</p><p>The executive committee of the Victoria Branch of the
Association of University Staff is opposed to increasing
student fees at the university, spokesperson Dr Richard
Arnold said today. He was responding to a 4.5% increase
proposed by the Vice Chancellor that will be considered by
the university’s council at 4pm on Thursday 9
September</p><p>“AUS has always advocated as low fees as
possible and the Victoria Branch Executive fully supports
students in opposing any increase in fees at Victoria,”  Dr
Arnold said. </p><p>“Increased tuition fees put University study
further and further out of reach for many people, and for
others mean a crippling burden of debt on completion of
their studies.  </p><p>“It is of grave concern to staff to see
students having to work excessive hours in employment during
teaching terms to the detriment of their studies.  </p><p>“The
answer to the university's problems lies in increased
government funding not increased course fees” </p><p>“The AUS is
working with Vice Chancellors to prepare a comprehensive
case to put to Government on the need for increased funding
and is also taking part in tripartite talks on the matter.
That is where the pressure must go.</p><p>“There is wealth of
empirical evidence that tertiary education is a public good,
not just in providing employers with a pool of skilled
employees but in increasing tax revenue and decreasing
welfare expenditure. It is an investment opportunity the
Government cannot afford to miss”, Mr Arnold said.</p><p>
