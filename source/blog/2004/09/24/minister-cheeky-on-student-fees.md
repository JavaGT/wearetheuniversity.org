<p>Minister cheeky on student fees
says university staff union</p>

<p>The Government should increase
overall funding to universities in order to ensure that
student tuition fees are kept to a minimum, according to Dr
Bill Rosenberg, National President of the Association of
University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg was responding to a
statement by the Associate Minister of Education, Steve
Maharey, in which he urged the governing councils of
universities to think carefully about how much they need to
increase student tuition fees, so they are kept as low as
possible, for next year.</p>

<p>Government funding of
universities per student has declined by 21 percent in real
(inflation adjusted) terms over the decade to 2002, and New
Zealand's public investment in tertiary education is now
lower than the average for other OECD countries as a
proportion of GDP. It is significantly lower than in
Australia and the United States.</p>

<p>"It is clear is that
Government needs to boost funding rather than leaving
tertiary institutions having to consider further increasing
student tuition fees," said Dr Rosenberg. "Fees must be kept
as low as possible, but in order for that to happen funding
needs to be seriously addressed. The Government can well
afford this with its mountainous budget surplus, and the
spending would fit in well with its economic and social
strategies."</p>

<p>"It is a cheek for the Minister on one hand
to continue to under fund the universities, but on the other
to tell them they should not increase tuition fees," said Dr
Rosenberg. "The increase in public funding for universities
for next year has been set at less than the level of
inflation. Clearly that will be insufficient to meet
increased costs faced in the sector, including salary claims
for parity with comparable staff elsewhere, which all
acknowledge are necessary."</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg said that the
Minister must intervene to increase funding if he is to
ensure that universities can ensure the delivery of
high-quality without increasing tuition fees.</p>
