<p><img align="left" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/images/AUSlogo.jpg" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0">The Association of University Staff (AUS)
Massey Branch Committee has announced today that it supports
students in their opposition to proposed fee increases at
Massey University. Massey is proposing to increase fees by
5% for 2005, the highest permissible under the Government’s
Fee Maxima policy, at its Council meeting tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p>“The answer to the inadequate funding of
universities lies with the Government.  The University
should not be reliant on student fee increases to balance
its books,” said Harvey Jones, Massey AUS Branch President.<p>

<p>“The University seems to care more about making a
huge surplus in order to meet vague Ministry of Education
Guidelines than it does for the welfare of its staff and
students,” said Mr Jones. “If it is genuinely committed to
improving staff salaries, it would realise that a cash
injection from Government rather than students is needed.
AUS believes that increased funding for staff salaries needs
to come from the Government.”</p>

<p>“The AUS is trying to
convince Massey University to agree to a national bargaining
strategy, similar to that being run by nurses, which will
target the Government to fund a salary settlement for all
university staff across the country”.</p>

<p>“Increased tuition
fees will further limit participation in university studies
to the rich or favoured, or to those willing to endure a
crippling burden of debt on completion of their studies.
Such increases also see more students working longer hours
in employment while also trying to study full-time, thereby
hindering their study”.<p>
<p>“Investment in tertiary education
is a public good. The Government needs to put more money
into universities to ensure that a quality education can be
provided. Given that the Government is currently sitting on
a $7.4 billion dollar surplus we cannot see why fees need to
increase or why staff salary claims can’t be met”.</p>
