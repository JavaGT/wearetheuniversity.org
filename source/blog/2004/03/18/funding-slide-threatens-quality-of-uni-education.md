<p>Funding Slide Threatens Quality Of University
Education</p>

<p>Association of University Staff<br>Media Release
- Education reporter<br>Wednesday 17 March 2004</p>

<p>Funding
slide threatens quality of university education University
funding has declined 23 per cent in real terms over the past
decade, according to research released today by the
Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>The research report
- University income and student numbers between 1980 and
2002 - by economists Guy and Helen Scott investigated trends
in New Zealand university income and compared data with that
from relevant OECD countries.</p>

<p>Report findings include the
fact that Ministry of Education funding per domestic
equivalent full-time student in universities fell, in
inflation adjusted terms, from $9609 in 1992 to $7367 in
2002.</p>

<p>AUS National Resident Dr Bill Rosenberg noted that
Government assertions that the erosion of university funding
which occurred under the previous administration had now
stopped were in fact incorrect.  Between 1999 and 2002,
Government grants to universities fell from 46 per cent to
42 per cent of total operating revenue.  Over the same time,
income from student tuition fees increased from 23 per cent
to 29 per cent, all of that increase being from
international student fees.</p>

<p>Dr Rosenberg pointed to the
current cap on tuition fees, through the fees maxima policy,
which meant that approximately two thirds of university
income was now determined by the Government, even though it
provided only 42 percent of operating revenue.<p>
<p>Universities had increased their incomes by reliance on
at-risk sources such as international student fees and
contestable research contracts. The report authors had
commented that this situation reduced job security for
staff.</p>

<p>The compound effect of diminished funding and high
student to staff ratios would have an effect on the quality
of university teaching and research, making it harder to
attract academic staff in an increasingly competitive
international market.  Most universities were finding it
harder to attract good international academic staff and
there were predictions of a major international staff crisis
within universities by 2010.</p>
