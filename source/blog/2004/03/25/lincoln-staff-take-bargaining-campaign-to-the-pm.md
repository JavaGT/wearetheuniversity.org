Release<br>Thursday, 25 March 2004</p><p>Lincoln Staff Take
National Bargaining Campaign to the PM</p><p>Members of the AUS
(Association of University Staff) and PSA at Lincoln
University staged a protest rally today while the Prime
Minister was on campus to officially open Lincoln's new
Centre of Research Excellence in Advanced Bio-Protection
Technologies.  The protest was part of an on-going national
campaign to obtain better pay and conditions for university
staff.  The campaign will culminate in a vote on strike
action at union meetings to be held at each university next
week. </p><p>AUS Lincoln Branch President Walt Abell said "staff
wanted to ensure that the Prime Minster and the Government
understood the impact of chronic funding shortages on staff
salaries and conditions.  Staff are saying quite clearly
that they will no longer accept non-competitive salaries and
increasing workloads."</p><p>The rally was held outside the
Lincoln Registry building at lunchtime. A silent picket was
staged while the Prime Minister was escorted across campus
to the official ceremonies.  Members then gathered to hear
various speakers, including AUS National President Dr. Bill
Rosenberg who reported to them on mediation between the
university employers and the unions earlier this week, which
was initiated by AUS to attempt to resolve the
dispute.</p><p>"Government funding per university student had
fallen dramatically over the last fifteen years. The effect
of the funding shortfall has been to force rises in student
fees, deteriorating facilities, and demonstrably inadequate
salaries and working conditions which affect the quality of
education and research that institutions can offer," Dr.
Rosenberg said.

<p>Both Drs Rosenberg and Abell were careful
to point out that the rally was aimed at the lack of
progress towards nation-wide employment agreements to cover
academic and non-academic staff.  "In no way was the protest
about Lincoln's Centre of Research Excellence.  Lincoln
staff are justifiably proud of the university's achievement
in this area," Dr. Abell said.  </p><p>University unions have
been in negotiations for new collective agreements since
last October.  They are seeking an across the board pay rise
of 10% this year and commitment to further rises, fair
workloads and more participation in decision making.  Strike
action to be voted on at next week's meetings would include
five days of action over five weeks to be followed by a five
consecutive days of strike action.</p><p> ENDS</p><p></p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
