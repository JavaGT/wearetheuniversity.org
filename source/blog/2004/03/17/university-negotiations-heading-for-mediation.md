<p><br>University negotiations heading for mediation</p>

<p>An
industrial mediator has been brought in to try and break an
impasse between university employers and unions after
attempts to negotiate new national collective employment
agreements across the sector reached an impasse.</p>

<p>At stop
work meetings held over the last two weeks, university staff
comprehensively rejected salary offers of between 2% and
2.8% made by the employers to renew current enterprise-based
collective employment agreements. The university employers
have  refused to agree to national collective agreements.</p>

<p>Staff are currently engaged in low level protest activity
which is concentrated at sending a message to Government and
their employers that significant salary increases and
national collective employment agreements are needed in the
university sector, and must be funded by Government. The
protest action, which began yesterday, will continue until
the end of next week.<p>

<p>Combined university unions'
advocate, Association of University Staff Industrial Officer
Jeff Rowe, said that unless significant progress is made, a
recommendation will be made to union members to take up to
ten days strike action. Support for such action was
foreshadowed at recent meetings.</p>

<p>Mediation is scheduled
to take place in Wellington on Tuesday 23 and Wednesday 24
March.
