<p>Media Release<br>Tuesday, 2nd of March<br>For Immediate
Use</p>

<p>Brash’s comments on education little more than<br>“ill
informed populism”</p>

<p>The Auckland University Students’
Association has formally denounced what it sees as the
clearly uninformed comments made by Dr Don Brash regarding
preferential University admission for Maori.</p>

<p>“It should be
clearly evident to New Zealanders that Dr Brash’s agenda has
very little to do with equality and far more to do with
ill-informed populism” noted AUSA President Kate
Sutton.</p>

<p>“If Dr Brash wanted to do something both popular
and which promoted equity he should increase access to
living allowances for all students instead of reverting to
racist slurs.” continued Ms Sutton.</p>

<p>The Auckland
University Students Association has a long history of
promoting equity; both in education and wider New Zealand
Society, and Dr Brash’s comments have alarmed many within
the organisation and the student body.</p>

<p>“As the evaluation
standards for Maori and non-Maori students are the same Dr
Brash’s claim that Maori graduates have substandard degrees
in fact devalues all degrees” said Joseph Randall, Education
Vice-President, “if anyone is creating unequal standards it
is Dr Brash”.</p>

<p>AUSA firmly stands by Nga Tauira Maori, the
Auckland University Maori Students Association, in their
response to Dr Brash’s
comments.</p>
