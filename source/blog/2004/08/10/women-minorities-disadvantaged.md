         Tuesday, 10 August 2004</p><p>Women, minorities disadvantaged in
university research assessment</p><p>Men received "A" ratings at
four times the rate of their female counterparts under the
new Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF), according to
data just released to the Association of University Staff
(AUS) by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). Only 2
percent of women received an "A" rating, compared to 8
percent of males.</p><p>A demographic analysis of the results
show that women are much less likely than men to be rated as
top researchers, and are over-represented in the "R" (which
has been described as research-inactive) category. Just over
16 percent of women and 36 percent of men received an "A" or
"B" rating, while 53 percent of women and 31 percent of men
received an "R". Women researchers received an average
quality score of 1.69, whereas the average for men was 3.14
out of a possible 5.</p><p>The results replicate similar data
from the United Kingdom which showed that male researchers
there are almost twice as likely as females to be designated
"research-inactive". Research activity is one of the
principal criteria for promotion in universities.</p><p>AUS
spokesperson Dr Liz Poole said that the release of the data
confirmed previously expressed concerns that the PBRF
process would discriminate against women who had, for
example, taken parental leave or other breaks in duties to
tend to family responsibilities. "For many women, those
years which are often considered to be potentially the most
productive in terms of research are those which coincide
with them being out of the workforce," she said. "Where this
occurs it will significantly diminish the assessment results
for women staff, and it is difficult to believe that these
will not have an influence on promotion."
</p>
<p>Dr Poole said
that in order to protect against discrimination, the PBRF
should be changed to assess the research performance of
groups and not look at the performance of individuals.</p><p>The
demographic data also highlights similar concerns about the
results for Maori and Pasifika researchers. The average
quality score was 1.69 for Maori staff and 1.57 for Pasifika
staff, while it was 2.58 for those designated
Pakeha/European.</p><p>The analysis of data has only been made
available after pressure from AUS which has, from the
outset, been concerned that the individual nature of PBRF
assessment would have a detrimental effect on women, Maori
and Pasifika researchers. The TEC initially decided it would
not release demographic data after the University of
Auckland failed to provide any information about the age,
ethnicity or gender of their staff participating in the PBRF
exercise.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
