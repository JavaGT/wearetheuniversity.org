<p><br>Pay settlement at Victoria University</p>

<p>General
(non-academic) staff at Victoria University of Wellington
(VUW) today voted to accept a new pay offer from the
University. Acceptance of the offer, which was for a  3
percent salary increase  from 1 May 2004, brings to an end a
six week dispute which saw VUW general staff take strike
action and threaten a University-wide shut-down during the
first week of second semester enrolments.</p>

<p>General staff
have been claiming a 4 percent pay rise, in line with their
academic colleagues.</p>

<p>Association of University Staff (AUS)
general staff spokesperson, Tony Quinn, said that the
improvements in salary offer came as a direct result of
industrial action. "The strike on Monday 31 May resulted in
the employer's offer being increased from 2.2 percent to 2.5
percent, and the threat of a "first-week shutdown" raised
that offer further to the current 3 percent."</p>

<p>"While union
members remain unhappy about the disparity with their
academic colleagues, they are delighted with their success
in improving the offer," said Mr Quinn. "Union participation
is at an all-time high, and staff have the confidence that
if need be they can repeat an effective industrial action
campaign in the future if salary claims are not addressed in
a satisfactory manner."
