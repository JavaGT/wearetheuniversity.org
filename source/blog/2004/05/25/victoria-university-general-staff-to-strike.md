at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) will strike on
Monday 31 May in support of a claim to increase salaries by
4%. Last week they rejected a salary offer of 2.2% and
voted, at a series of meetings, to take industrial and
protest action in support of the 4% claim.<p>

<p>Association of
University Staff (AUS) general staff spokesperson Tony Quinn
said that the current salary offer from VUW was the lowest
offer made to any group of university staff in New Zealand
in the current wage round, and was well below the New
Zealand national average wage and salary increase of
2.5%.</p>

<p>Mr Quinn said that VUW posted an official profit of
$7.6 million dollars last year, and looked to be heading for
a record financial surplus this year with higher than
budgeted enrolments. “The money is there, but any goodwill
to share the profit with the staff that helped create it is
sadly lacking,” he said.</p>

<p>“General staff are insulted by
their salary offer from VUW management,” said Mr Quinn.
“They are being offered significantly less than their
academic counterparts, and markedly less than what is being
offered at other universities.”</p>

<p>Academic staff at VUW have
accepted a 4% salary increase for 2004, and most other
universities (excepting Otago) have settled new agreements
which provide salary increases of between 3% and 4%.<p>
<p>“General staff make up half the workforce at the
university, and come from a wide variety of specialist
trades and professions,” said Mr Quinn. “The core university
function of teaching and research is a team effort towards
which general staff make an essential and valuable
contribution. In making a differential pay offer between
general and academic staff, the University deliberately
fails to appreciate and reward general staff for their
contribution to the academic success of the institution. It
also divides one group of staff from the other”</p>

<p>Mr Quinn
said that without general staff the university simply could
not operate. “They are the public face of the university,
and are the main point of contact with students in their
day-to-day campus life. They ensure the smooth running of
the entire University and should be treated in a manner
which reflects that,” he said.</p>
