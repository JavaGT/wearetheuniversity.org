<p>Massey University staff oppose honorary
degree</p>

<p>The Massey University Branch of the Association of
University Staff (AUS) has strongly criticised the decision
of the Massey University Council to award an honorary
doctorate degree to former Vice-Chancellor Professor James
McWha at the Wellington graduation ceremony
today.</p>

<p>"Professor McWha's term as Vice-Chancellor was an
absolute disaster," said AUS Massey Branch President Harvey
Jones. "The decision to award him an honorary degree reeks
of cronyism and is a slap in the face to those staff that
lost their jobs during his tenure, particularly as a result
of restructuring in 2000."</p>

<p>Mr Jones said that the
University Council members should be ashamed of themselves
and their decision. He said that, during his period as
Vice-Chancellor, Professor McWha was responsible for:<p>

<p>*	a
restructuring exercise in which many staff unnecessarily
lost their jobs, and caused significant lowering of staff
morale; <br>*	a massive cost-overrun on the renovations to
the Museum building on the Wellington campus. <br>*	building
the Rugby Institute, Athletics Track and Equestrian Centre
on the basis of a public relations exercise rather than
because of any academic merit.</p>

<p>"The University has decided
to reward the architect of a flawed restructuring and its
inevitable redundancies," Mr Jones said. "Instead of an
honorary degree, the Council should call on Professor McWha
to publicly acknowledge former staff who lost their jobs
during his tenure.</p>

<p>"The Council is on the run with this
award and they know it," said Mr Jones. "They have delayed
its announcement and are presenting it in Wellington where
there is less chance of protest."</p>
