         Association of University Staff - Media Release</p><p>Wednesday,
19 May 2004</p><p>University staff call for greater involvement
in appointment process</p><p>University staff have called for
increased involvement in the appointment processes for new
vice-chancellors after the Association of University Staff
(AUS) was excluded from any participation in the selection
of a new vice-chancellor for the University of
Auckland.</p><p>It is understood that interviews for the
vice-chancellorship have been completed and an offer of
appointment made to one of the applicants.</p><p>The National
President of the AUS Dr Bill Rosenberg said that university
councils are empowered by statute to seek advice from
relevant parties and may invite appropriate people to be
involved in either an examination of the applications or in
the Council's deliberations for such an appointment.</p><p>AUS
Branch President Associate Professor Wills said the
University of Auckland Council had only allowed the
involvement of a small group of staff after its initial
process had failed to find any suitable candidate for the
position. It then restricted staff participation to those on
the University Council and few others who have only now been
identified after the event. "The secrecy surrounding this
appointment process is unacceptable," he said. "It is
extremely disappointing that, despite numerous attempts to
raise the issue with the Chancellor, the AUS has been
prevented from briefing candidates on staff concerns at a
time when a delicate industrial situation exists and
Auckland staff have not yet ratified a collective employment
agreement with the administration after backing down from a
national strike."

<p>"It is both logical and reasonable to
consult widely and involve staff in such an appointment,
given that the vice-chancellor is to be the university's
senior academic leader and senior manager," said Associate
Professor Wills. He said a vice-chancellor requires the
confidence and support of all staff, and it had been the
usual practice in New Zealand universities to involve staff
and AUS widely in the process.</p><p>The appointment process at
the University of Auckland can be contrasted with that at
Oxford University in England, where Dr John Hood is soon to
take up the Vice-Chancellorship .  His appointment was
subject to ratification by the staff.</p><p>Dr Rosenberg and
Associate Professor Wills called on the Chancellor and
University Council to consult with staff and the AUS to
establish a policy on future appointment processes for new
vice-chancellors.</p><p>Ends</p><p></p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
