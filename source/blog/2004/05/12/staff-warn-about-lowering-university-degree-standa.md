         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0">The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has warned against dropping the
legislative requirement for degrees to be taught by people
mainly engaged in research, saying that such a move would
threaten the quality of New Zealand academic qualifications
and the international reputation of New Zealand
degrees.</p><p>The warning comes after the Tertiary Education
Commission (TEC) today released a consultation paper which
questions whether the legislative requirement for
research-based teaching for degrees should be reviewed. The
consultation paper forms part of a part of a review into the
future roles of tertiary education organisations (TEOs) in
New Zealand. </p><p>AUS National President, Dr Bill Rosenberg,
said that research-informed teaching was vital for
undergraduate degrees. “It is what distinguished degrees
from other tertiary qualifications,” he said. “Any
suggestion that standards for degree-teaching should be
lowered contradicted the Government’s intention to
strengthen New Zealand’s academic reputation.”</p><p>“The
results of the recent Performance-Based Research Funding
(PBRF) assessment clearly showed that quality-research in
this country’s education institutions was limited to
universities,” said Dr Rosenberg. “Poor PBRF results from
the non-university institutions which teach degrees must not
be used to justify lowering standards,” he said.

<p>Despite
concerns about the future of degree teaching, Dr Rosenberg
said the proposed review of the future roles of TEOs was
welcome. “The competitive market system in education has
failed, and it is increasingly clear that universities have
certain roles that cannot and should not be filled by other
education providers,” he said. “We support the need for
greater differentiation between tertiary institutions. Each
has a unique role and can complement, rather than compete
against, each other.”</p><p>“AUS believes that the special role
of universities, particularly in postgraduate research,
needs not only to be recognized, but also adequately
funded,” said Dr Rosenberg.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further information
