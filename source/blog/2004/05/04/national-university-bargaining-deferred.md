         <br>National university bargaining deferred</p><p>Bargaining for
new  national collective employment agreements for academic
and general staff in New Zealand's seven traditional
universities has been deferred for the remainder of the
year.  This follows progress in national bargaining, most
notably an agreement by university employers to engage in a
working party with the unions to look at the form of
bargaining which would be most productive in the sector.
This includes looking at the benefits of multi-employer and
multi-union employment agreements.</p><p>The employers have also
agreed to work with the unions on a "white paper" on funding
and salaries which would form the basis of lobbying
Government, and have agreed on a joint union and employer
request for tripartite meetings with Government to identify
and address issues facing the sector.</p><p>The change came
during last-minute negotiations called in an attempt to
avert national strike action, scheduled to take place
throughout May.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the combined
university unions, Association of University Staff General
Secretary Helen Kelly said the deferral did not signal any
lessening of commitment to national bargaining and she
expected new national negotiations to begin early next
year.</p><p>"The decision to revert to enterprise agreements in
this bargaining round came only after Massey and Canterbury
Universities gave a clear indication that they believed
there may be benefit in national collective agreements," she
said. "That is a significant change and one we have
acknowledged by deferring national bargaining this
year"

<p>Ms Kelly said the change was important given the
employers' refusal, to that point, to engage with each other
or the unions on a collective and cooperative basis. "It
certainly gives us a practical base from which to address
funding and salary issues in a productive manner," she
said.</p><p>While national bargaining has been deferred,
settlement of local agreements will now depend on acceptable
pay offers being made.</p><p>Union members at Auckland, Waikato,
Victoria (academic only), Lincoln, and Canterbury will
consider the pay offers made to them over the next
fortnight. Those at Massey and Otago have rejected their
salary offers and will determine whether to seek further
negotiations with their employers or to take industrial
action.</p><p>Current salary offers are:</p><p>Auckland: 3.5% for
academic and general staff</p><p>Waikato:3% for academic and
general staff</p><p>Massey: 3% for academic staff. General staff
have been offered 2.8% with a further 0.2% from 1 January
2005</p><p>Victoria: 4% for academic staff and 2.2% for general
staff</p><p>Canterbury:3.5% for academic and general
staff</p><p>Lincoln: 2.6% for academic and general
staff</p><p>Otago:3.5% for academic staff and 2.5% for general
staff (from 1 May)
