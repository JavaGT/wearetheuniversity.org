	 <p>
         Don't increase student fees say university staff</p><p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has called on other
New Zealand universities to follow the lead of Massey
University by not increasing student tuition fees for 2005.
The Massey University Council voted last week, by seven
votes to six, to reject recommendations by University
management to increase tuition fees by 5 percent.</p><p>The call
from AUS follows a proposal from Waikato University's
Finance Committee to increase tuition fees by between 3.39
and 3.48 percent for next year. This proposal will be
considered at the University Council meeting next
month.</p><p>AUS General Secretary, Helen Kelly, said that
increasing student fees would add to existing student debt,
which had already reached an intolerable level, or would
further limit the participation of students in university
education.</p><p>Ms Kelly said that further public investment
was needed in the university sector, and this was well
illustrated by Waikato University's statement that it needs
an additional $4.5 million next year simply to keep pace
with rising costs. "Waikato University needs to join with
Massey and other universities to pressure government to
increase funding to meet these costs. Placing more debt on
students will not solve the long term problem of
underfunding."</p><p>Government funding of universities per
student has declined by 21 percent in real (inflation
adjusted) terms over the decade to 2002, and New Zealand's
public investment in tertiary education is now lower than
the average for other OECD countries as a proportion of GDP.
It is significantly lower than in Australia and the United
States.

<p>"It is clear is that Government needs to boost
funding rather than leaving tertiary institutions having to
consider further increasing student tuition fees," said Ms
Kelly. "Fees must be kept as low as possible, but in order
for that to happen funding needs to be seriously addressed.
The Government can well afford this with a $7 billion budget
surplus, and the spending would fit in well with its
economic and social strategies."</p><p>Auckland, Waikato,
Canterbury, Lincoln and Otago universities and the Auckland
University of Technology are due to set their 2005 fees over
the next two months</p><p>Ends</p><p></p><p>
