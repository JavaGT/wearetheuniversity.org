University      </p><p>No need for staff cuts at Massey
following zero fee increase decision</p><p>The Association of
University Staff, Massey Branch, is today rejecting
suggestions that staffing levels or staff salary increases
need to be affected by last Friday's decision of the
University Council to hold fees at 2004 levels for next
year.</p><p>It has been reported that staff pay rises and
overall staffing levels may be at risk following the
decision.</p><p>"There is simply no need to reduce staffing
levels," said AUS Massey Branch President, Harvey Jones.
"The University's own budget scenarios show that the only
difference between a zero and five percent increase is the
impact on the size of the University's projected surplus for
2005."</p><p>"Across all of the budget scenarios presented to
the Council, the impact on staff salaries remains the same.
Even with a 7% fee increase the University would not have
spent a dollar more on staff," said Mr Jones.</p><p>"The
suggestion that staff numbers will need to be cut is just
scare-ongering. Massey is still forecasting a big surplus of
$6.6 million dollars next year. This is on the back of $45.9
million dollars worth of accumulated surpluses over the past
three years. There is no case for cuts."</p><p>University staff
are campaigning for a government-funded national salary
settlement to bring staff salaries into line with those
offered in Australian universities.</p><p>"If Massey University
management is concerned about the ability of the University
to pay staff decent salaries, then we urge them to support
our national bargaining campaign which, if successful, will
see an injection of money into the university sector for
those salaries", said Mr Jones.</p><p>ENDS</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>
