<p>Auckland University Students face fee increases today.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The University of Auckland Council meeting to increase
fees is Today (Monday 18th October) in the Music Theatre
number 6 Symonds Street at 4pm.</p>

<p></p>

<p>University of Auckland
Students will be attending the meeting to show their disgust
at the proposed increases.</p>

<p></p>

<p>“I cannot talk about the
exact proposed increases but they are big, bigger than last
year, and will be crippling to students next year and in the
long term”  Said AUSA president Kate Sutton</p>

<p></p>

<p>The AUSA
is encouraging all students and interested public to attend
and see the fee setting discussion take place.</p>

<p></p>

<p>“It is
so important that the councillors see the people that they
are responsible too. Then maybe they will understand the
debt that real students are facing and its negative
effects.” Sutton ended.</p>
