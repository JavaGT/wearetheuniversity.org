Institutions Allied Staff Association</p><p>Media Release</p><p>Attn
Education/Industrial Reporter 8 April 2004</p><p>Overwhelming
mandate for university strike action</p><p>Union members at New
Zealand universities have voted to take up to five days
strike action in support of pay claims and new national
collective employment agreements for academic and general
staff. </p><p>Unions representing more than 7,000 university
staff have been in negotiations since October 2003 claiming
two new national collective agreements to replace more than
13 enterprise agreements currently negotiated at a local
university level. </p><p>Salary claims of up to 10% per annum
for each of the next three years were filed by staff in an
attempt to address long standing national and international
pay disparities. A claim has also been made for a national
job evaluation for general staff to provide a national
consistency to salary rates.</p><p>University employers have
offered salary increases of between 2.0% and 4.0%, and have
refused to agree to the new national collective employment
agreements.</p><p>At a series of meetings held in the seven
traditional New Zealand universities over the past week,
union members participating in the ballot have voted by 79%
to embark on the strike action over five weeks from 28
April. A full day's strike action will take place on 28
April and on 25 May, with full or partial strike action
scheduled in the intervening weeks.
</p>
<p>A further five days of
strike action have been foreshadowed for July if the dispute
is not resolved before then.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of the
combined unions, Association of University Staff (AUS)
General Secretary Helen Kelly said it was time university
employers and the Government seriously addressed the salary
and funding issues which have beset the sector for over a
decade. "Government funding of universities has diminished
by 23% in real terms over the last decade and this has
resulted in an erosion of salary rates which threatens the
long-term quality of university education," she said.</p><p>"The
decision, to take an unprecedented level of industrial
action, shows that staff are no longer prepared to leave
these matters unresolved." "Employers in the sector have no
strategy for challenging the Government's continued
underfunding of universities; we are providing that
strategy," said Ms Kelly. "Without increased funding,
looming workforce shortages will start to have a real impact
on the country's ability to deliver quality university
education. Employers have a responsibility for the long term
health of the system and they are neglecting it."</p><p>Ms Kelly
said that in light of the strong mandate in the ballot, the
unions have written to the universities inviting further
negotiations in an attempt to try and resolve the
dispute.</p><p>The universities affected are Auckland, Waikato,
Massey, Victoria, Canterbury, Lincoln and Otago.</p><p>Ends</p><p>
