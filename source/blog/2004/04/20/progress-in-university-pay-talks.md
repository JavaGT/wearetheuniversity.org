<p>Media Advisory</p>

<p>20 April 2004</p>

<p>Progress in university pay
talks<p>

<p>Planned strike action in universities, scheduled
for next Wednesday, has been called off after further
negotiations between university and union representatives in
Wellington this morning.</p>

<p>AUS General Secretary Helen
Kelly, speaking on behalf of the combined university unions,
said that while she was unable to release details of today's
negotiation, sufficient ground had been made to avert the
first of five days of strike action planned over the next
five weeks.</p>

<p>Ms Kelly said that the employers were now
considering a new proposal to make progress in the dispute
and they would be responding to the unions by Friday this
week.<p>

<p>Meetings would be held late next week with union
members at the seven universities involved in the
negotiations to consider the employers' response to the new
proposal<p>

<p>The Unions, representing more than 7,000
university staff, have been in negotiations since October
2003 claiming two new national collective employment
agreements to replace more than 13 enterprise agreements
currently negotiated at a local university level.<p>

<p>University employers have offered salary increases of
between 2.0% and 4.0%, and have refused to agree to national
collective employment agreements.</p>
