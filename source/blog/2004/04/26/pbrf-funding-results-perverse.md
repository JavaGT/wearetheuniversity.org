	 <p>
         Media Release</p><p> 26 April 2004</p><p>PBRF funding results
"perverse"</p><p>The changes in research funding to universities
in response to their Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF)
results have been "perverse" says the Association of
University Staff (AUS).</p><p>"The PBRF appears to reward
high-cost subjects and the ability to attract external
research income more than it rewards high quality scores. It
may also reflect a bias against research students in the new
funding regime," said AUS National President Dr Bill
Rosenberg, commenting on the results announced last week by
the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).</p><p>For example,
Lincoln University will receive the second-highest
percentage increase in funding among the seven universities
despite being the second lowest ranked university by quality
score. Yet Canterbury received the third-lowest increase in
funding (less than the increase in the total PBRF) despite
being second-highest ranked.</p><p>In Canterbury's case this is
apparently because it is particularly strong in the number
of research students it attracts. Since the funding being
phased out is based on student numbers, it lost more funding
than it gained.</p><p>This raises the question: will the new
regime discourage universities from attracting research
students?</p><p>Otago, which came fourth in the rankings,
received the highest percentage increase, and Auckland, top
ranked, received third-highest percentage increase.</p><p>"The
scheme appears to reward high-cost subjects and the ability
to attract external research income - which is not available
to researchers in many subject areas - more than it rewards
high quality scores", said Dr Rosenberg. "Is that what its
designers intended?"</p><p>[Note: the information on which this
release is based is in Table 8.4 on page 80 of the Tertiary
Education Commission's report on the PBRF
results.]</p><p>Ends</p><p></p><p>
