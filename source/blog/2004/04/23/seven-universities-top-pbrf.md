University Staff (AUS) President Bill Rosenberg said today
that it will not be a surprise to anyone that the seven
traditional New Zealand Universities are at the top of the
tertiary sector in terms of research quality.</p><p>Commenting
on the release today of the Performance Based Research Fund
results (PBRF), Dr Rosenberg said “The results show that if
the Government wants to increase research output in New
Zealand, then the best place to invest resources is in the
seven top institutions – which are all Universities.”
</p><p>“The results show that even the lowest scoring of these 7
universities scored almost double its closest rival and no
other institution even reached a “C” grade average.  In a
country where tertiary money is short, the Government needs
to put money into institutions that are capable of quality
research, “ he said.</p><p>Dr Rosenberg said that AUS members
have had enough now of all the measuring, strategising and
talk, and now expected the Government to invest.  He noted
that in the introduction to the report the Associate
Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) said that it was
vital to retain good researchers in the New Zealand system.
“The only way he can do that is to put more money into
Universities,” said Dr Rosenberg.  </p><p>“An immediate measure
would be to speed up the move to PBRF funding and to
increase the overall pot of money in the fund,”  Dr
Rosenberg said.
