	 <p>
         17 December 2004	</p><p>Green light for national salary
bargaining in universities</p><p>Members of the Association of
University Staff (AUS) have voted overwhelmingly to support
the negotiation of national collective employment agreements
in the next bargaining round. </p><p>The ballot, conducted on a
university-by-university basis, endorsed a recommendation by
the AUS and other university unions, to move from
enterprise-based bargaining at each university campus to the
negotiation of one national collective agreement for
academic staff and another for general staff employed in the
seven traditional universities. </p><p>1509 (94.3%) of the 1600
academic staff who participated in the ballot voted in
support of the proposal, and 1442 (92.5%) of the 1558
general staff also voted to support national bargaining.
</p><p>The result means that bargaining with the universities
will be initiated early in the New Year, and it is expected
that formal negotiations will commence in February.</p><p>AUS
General Secretary, Helen Kelly, said she was delighted with
the result. “The high number of those voting, along with the
high level of support for the proposal, has given the AUS a
very clear mandate to enter national bargaining with
university employers, and we look forward to engaging in
constructive dialogue with them in the New Year.” </p><p>“It
also shows that university staff appreciate the very clear
link between funding and salaries, and support the view that
the Government has a responsibility to increase sector
funding significantly in order to resolve long-standing
problems with salary levels.”

<p>Ms Kelly said that the
Government had given a clear signal that national employment
agreements could be used as a mechanism to ensure that any
additional public funding delivered to universities would be
used to address salary disparities. “The Minister has said
that he is interested in a targeted approach to salaries
because, although tertiary education funding has increased
by 46.4 percent in real terms since 1999, it has not
adequately found its way into salaries.”</p><p>Ms Kelly said she
expected university employers to support the decision of
union members and recognise that the salary crisis in the
sector was an issue that would only be resolved on a
national basis, and with the co-operation of university
employers, unions and the Government. “We have provided them
with the mechanism to make this happen,” she
said</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
