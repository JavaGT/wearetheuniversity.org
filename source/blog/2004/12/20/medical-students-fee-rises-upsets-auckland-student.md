<p>Auckland University Students Association<br>Media Statement
for Immediate Release</p>

<p>Medical Students Fee Rises Upsets
Auckland Students</p>

<p>Auckland students are deeply upset by
the decision of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) to
allow the University of Auckland to raise medical  student
fees by 10% for next year.</p>

<p>This rise represents an extra
$1000 a year in fee costs for Medical students.</p>

<p>Students
feel that the University is increasing their already healthy
budget surpluses by  increasing the financial burden on
students,and that this will further add to  spiralling
student debt and offer further incentive for graduates to
work  overseas, according to AUSA Acting President Joseph
Randall.<p>

<p>The Auckland University Students' Association is
joining with the New  Zealand Universities Students'
Association (NZUSA) in investigating legal  action over this
decision.</p>

<p>"These substantial fee rises show that fee
maxima is not working, especially  when it opens the way for
such unjustified exemptions.It is deplorable that legal
action is the only option left to students in order to stop
these increases", noted AUSA President-elect Greg
Langton.</p>
