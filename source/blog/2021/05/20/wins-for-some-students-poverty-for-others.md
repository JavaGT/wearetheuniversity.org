<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
believes that Budget 2021 is a missed opportunity to support
all students in Aotearoa. The reintroduction of the Training
Incentive Allowance will aid 16,000 students who have,
historically, been failed. However, NZUSA National President
Andrew Lessells says that many have missed out as
“postgrad and mature students are still expected to live
on food parcels”.</p>

<p>While the Student Allowance will
increase by $25 in 2022, this does not keep track with main
benefit increases. Lessells says “students facing hardship
have yet again been forgotten. Students deserve better than
being treated as second class citizens forced to borrow to
survive”.</p>

<p>The increase in Vocational Education
funding is welcomed and could revolutionise the sector.
NZUSA has fought hard with the Tertiary Education Union
(TEU) to ensure that there is enough funding to make the
Reform of Vocational Education a success. But it is
bittersweet that Universities under real financial pressure
see no real increases.</p>

<p>“Universities are having the
biggest growth in a generation, but funding simply doesn’t
reflect this. Staff in the sector are overworked and burning
out in droves. They need real wage increases and more
support from Government which is completely missing” says
TEU National President Tina Smith.</p>

<p>The extension of
the COVID-19 Learner Hardship Fund (HAFL) is promising,
however $5.8 million is a drop in the ocean for students
struggling to keep their heads above water. “We’re
extremely disappointed that there is no significant funding
to student wellbeing, given the Governments’ commitment to
the Code of Learner Wellbeing and Safety which will place
real costs and pressure on staff and students in the
sector” says Lessells.</p>

<p>Overall Budget 2021 is a win
for the sector, but students expected and deserve far more.
They deserve to be able to afford to
live.</p>
