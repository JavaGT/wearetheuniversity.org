	 <p>
         </p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations is
disappointed that the Education and Workforce Select
Committee’s Report on Student Accommodation released today
does not address many of the concerns raised by students
throughout the inquiry.</p><p>"While the Select Committee
does support the new proposed Code of Learner Wellbeing and
Safety, it does not challenge the status quo of students
being treated as cash cows by accommodation providers." says
National President Andrew Lessells.</p><p>“The Committee
missed a huge opportunity to protect students in halls by
giving them rights under the Residential Tenancies Act
(RTA). Students currently have differing rights depending on
their institution and have no clarity on what they’re
entitled to. Putting halls under the RTA would solve many of
these challenges and we are disappointed that the Committee
went against the recommendations of students.”</p><p>The
Inquiry also had a requirement in its Terms of Reference to
investigate whether student accommodation should be
for-profit. Lessells says that “despite submitters
overwhelmingly recommending that student accommodation
should be not-for-profit, the Committee has chickened out of
making a recommendation. While the Committee said it
listened to students, it’s disappointing that this voice
wasn’t heeded”.</p><p>The Select Committee’s
recommendations on strengthening the new Code of Learner
Wellbeing and Safety are welcomed, but Lessells cautions
that the Code is not a panacea. “The new Code is a useful
tool to protect students but isn’t the only one that
should be used. The Committee’s failure to recommend other
legislative changes will have a huge impact on the wellbeing
of students and may lead to unsafe practices
continuing.”</p>
