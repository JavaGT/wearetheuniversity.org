<p>The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations is
calling for increased student support to ensure that
students can continue to study amid fluctuating Alert
Levels.</p>

<p>"With this morning’s increase in COVID Alert
Levels, students face yet more uncertainty and stress at the
start of the academic year. They've already had their
orientations disrupted by COVID; the Government cannot allow
this virus to ruin their entire year" says National
President Andrew Lessells.</p>

<p>"Government needs to step
up for students to make sure they can access technology, to
make sure they can pay their rent, to make sure they can
afford to survive."</p>

<p>With the increase in Alert Levels
also comes significant mental hardship for the 400,000
students across Aotearoa. The Government has committed $25
million to mental health support for students but only $2
million is available this year.</p>

<p>“Last year’s $25
million for student mental health was a good start, but this
yo-yoing proves that far more is needed. This is the most
stressful time to be a student in generations and that’s
why NZUSA is asking the Government to double funding for
student mental health.” says Lessells.</p>

<p>During the
first lockdown in 2020, the Government introduced a Student
Hardship Fund for those who had lost jobs, and experienced
financial challenges because of COVID-19. NZUSA is calling
for this fund to be reintroduced, to make sure that support
is in place for students when they need it.</p>

<p>Students
are also calling for tertiary institutions to get more
Government funding to make sure they can teach remotely and
offer the quality education that students
deserve.</p>

<p>"Many universities and most polytechnics
don't have the resources to transition their courses to
decent online delivery, so the Government needs to step in
to make sure students get the education that Aotearoa's
tertiary sector prides itself on." Lessells
says.</p>

<p>NZUSA is working with our members and partners
to ensure that students needs are met at this challenging
time.</p><ul><li><strong>ENDS
