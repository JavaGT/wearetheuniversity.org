<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
frustrated with the lack of change heralded
by the review of the Performance Based Research
Fund.</p>

<p>National Secretary Sandra Grey is angry that
TEU’s voice has been largely ignored. She says
“tinkering with a fundamentally broken system doesn’t
benefit the public, learners or staff in the tertiary
sector.”</p>

<p>IPC Vice President Julie Douglas was
extremely disappointed with the announcement. “This is
just another example of the intrenched ignorance of our
academic workloads.”</p>

<p>U35 representative Zoë Port
singled out the Sector Representative Groups as one positive
step, but is eager to see dedicated representation for Early
Career Academics and young workers on the group. “PBRF is
something that can literally make or break the career of an
Early Career Academic. Any consultation is meaningless if it
doesn’t carefully factor in the voices that are the future
of this sector.”</p>

<p>Sandra Grey says the time has come
for a tripartite approach to the reform of tertiary funding.
“With government, providers and unions around the table
these kinds of misunderstandings can be talked through and
enduring solutions found rather than the current band-aid
approach.”</p>
