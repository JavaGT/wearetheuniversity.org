<p>Dixon commences her 8-month term to the
GSF Steering Committee this month.</p><h2>About the Global
Student Forum</h2><p>The Global Student Forum was founded by
the All-Africa Students’ Union (AASU), Commonwealth
Students’ Association (CSA), European Students’ Union
(ESU), Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions
(OBESSU), Organización Continental Latinoamericana y
Caribeña de Estudiantes (OCLAE), and other national student
organisations and movements.</p>

<p>The organisation serves
as a platform for students to build networks and facilitate
active solidarity through digital campaigns and
on-the-ground action. Through cooperation, analysis and
strategy it services as a coordinator for targeted political
action and advocacy efforts facilitated for and by
students.</p><h2>About the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations</h2><p>NZUSA is the national representative
body for students in tertiary education in Aotearoa New
Zealand. NZUSA has been a member-led association since 1929,
tirelessly advocating for students in universities and
polytechnics. Their vision is for an accessible and barrier
free tertiary education system.</p>

<p>They stand in
partnership with Te Mana Ākonga (National Māori Tertiary
Students’ Association), Tauira Pasifika (National Pasifika
Students’ Association) and the National Disabled
Students’ Association, to strengthen the student movement.
NZUSA upholds that education is a public good that benefits
the community, the nation and the
world.</p>
