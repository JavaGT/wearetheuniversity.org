	 <p>
         </p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
has joined the Global Student Forum (GSF).</p><p>NZUSA joins
198 student unions from 120 different countries in the GSF,
the worldwide umbrella organisation of democratic,
independent and representative student
organisations.</p><p>The NZUSA National Education Officer,
Ellen Dixon, has been selected to represent the Pacific on
the GSF Steering Committee due to her knowledge and
expertise in student activism at a local and global
level.</p><p>“It is an honour to be nominated by NZUSA to
represent the Pacific on the GSF Steering Committee, and a
privilege to stand in solidarity and partnership with the
global student movement” says Dixon.</p><p>“Upholding
student voice and human rights is essential, especially
considering the existential threats students and youth are
facing from climate change, economic uncertainty, and
COVID-19. I acknowledge the transformative capacity of
global student initiatives for education and the wider
international community” says Dixon.</p><p>NZUSA National
Vice President, Liam Davies says “Ellen’s extensive
knowledge and experience in student and youth activism will
put her in a good position to tackle the myriad of
challenges students face globally”.</p><p>“NZUSA’s
membership to the GSF, and the role we play in their
governance structure, could not have come at a better time.
COVID-19 has caused a myriad of issues that directly impact
students, and for NZUSA and Ellen to champion the voice of
the Pacific in a global setting is a welcome opportunity to
share experiences and work together, to find common
solutions”.</p>
