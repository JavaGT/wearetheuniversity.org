<p>At the end
of the second day, student leaders developed definitions of
what the <i>Tertiary Education Strategy’s</i> primary
objective of <i>“learners at the centre” </i>means to
them. NZUSA is compiling this voice to help tertiary
institutions truly understand how learners want them to
embed the <i>TES</i> objectives into decision making and
governance.</p>

<p>Te Mana Ākonga Tumuaki Takirua Nkhaya
Paulsen-More says “Having tauira come together from all
across the tertiary sector was incredible to see. We were
privileged to hear from a variety of student leaders over
the Summit, and are excited to welcome our incoming tauira
in their new roles as we help them develop their skills and
look forward to the next Summit.”</p>

<p>NZUSA and its
partners will be creating ongoing professional development
opportunities for student leaders based on the discussions
held at the Student Voice
Summit.</p>
