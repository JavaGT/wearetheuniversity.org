<p><i>“I think there is no hope for the university - that
is why I have resigned. It will continue the descent in a
self-destructive spiral. This was already happening pre
Covid-19 - this has just accelerated the
process.”</i></p>

<p><br>– A New Zealand
Academic</p>

<p><br>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education
Union has released the third iteration of its ‘Tertiary
Lives’ survey reports, looking at the impact of COVID-19
on those working in the tertiary education
sector.</p>

<p>From 1,021 responses to this survey in April
and May this year, including 615 from universities, 232 from
polytechnics , 29 from Wānanga and 15 from other
institutions; 85% expressed moderate to high and very high
stress. And only 3% said stress was not relevant.</p>

<p>TEU
Tumu Whakarae – Tina Smith says “this is not just an
ordinary report on the effects of COVID-19 and COVID-19
generated policy. It is a story of the undoing of
Aotearoa’s tertiary education system that preceded
COVID-19.”</p>

<p>“The responses illustrate the impact on
staff in the tertiary education sector of four processes –
a major government restructuring of the ITP sector;
persistent restructuring across the entire tertiary
education sector due to funding inadequacy; the ills caused
by a competitive environment; and the sector’s response to
a pandemic. These four processes have intertwined to produce
a troubled sector.”</p>

<p>“Workload demands, reduced
staffing levels, and difficulty maintaining a satisfactory
work life balance were listed as the major causes of stress
in our sector. These are all caused by structural failings.
But sadly only 3% of respondents felt management was taking
high stress levels seriously.”</p>

<p>The data for the 2021
survey was gathered prior to the recent Delta
outbreak.</p>
