         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union in
conjunction with Academic Freedom Aotearoa, Massey
University and NZUSA is proceeding with its Academic Freedom
Conference: Challenges and Opportunities next week on
Zoom.</p><p>The Conference is a timely contribution to an
ongoing discussion within Aotearoa on academic freedom, and
the role of tertiary education staff and institutions as
critic and conscience of society.</p><p>As Academic Freedom
Aotearoa spokesperson Professor Jack Heinemann (University
of Canterbury) points out, ‘COVID-19 has demonstrated just
how vital public scholars are in acting as the critic and
conscience of society.’</p><p>‘Without academics such as
Michael Baker (University of Otago), Siouxsie Wiles
(University of Auckland), Michael Plank and Alex James
(University of Canterbury), neither the public of New
Zealand nor our policy makers would be as informed and well
placed to make decisions in the best interests of the team
of five million. They could not have fulfilled their vital
roles in a national crisis without the freedom to pursue
their academic interests and put uncomfortable truths
forward into the national debate.’</p><p>Heinemann says
‘advocating for a country to shut down is not a popular
thing to do but successfully doing so has saved a lot of
lives.’</p><p>Covering topics ranging from activism and
critical voices, Māori and indigenous knowledge, to
ensuring academic freedom within our reformed vocational
education and training sector, conference attendees will be
part of a conversation exploring the many challenges and
opportunities academic freedom faces.</p>
