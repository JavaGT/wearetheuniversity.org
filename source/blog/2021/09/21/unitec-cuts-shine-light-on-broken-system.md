<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is once
again dismayed but not surprised to note yet another
Aotearoa New Zealand polytechnic attempting to cut its way
to growth despite this repeatedly failed strategy
contradicting the wishes of its parent
organisation.</p>

<p>Unitec Chief Executive Gus Gilmore has
informed staff that $2.5 million in savings needs to be
found because of the requirements of the Tertiary Education
Commission that to be financially viable every TEI must have
operating surpluses of 9-13%.</p>

<p>This is despite recent
advice from Te Pūkenga Chief Executive Stephen Town, in a
paper presented to all ITP CEs on 10 August 2021, that
“not all ITPs can achieve the targeted operating margin.
Instead, institutions were encouraged look towards
“progressive improvement for each ITP.”</p>

<p>TEU’s
Unitec Branch President, Wei Loo, is disappointed to see his
employer trying to cut costs unnecessarily, and warns it
should not be staff who are made to bear the brunt: “that
would not be building through kaitiakitanga, wakaritenga or
mahi.”</p>

<p>“We know for certain that staff are already
working at full capacity with workloads spiralling upwards
in recent years. Heading into Te Pūkenga, Unitec needs to
retain its highly skilled and dedicated staff. That’s true
of all our ITPs. Their experience will be essential for the
success of Te Pūkenga.”</p>

<p>TEU National Secretary,
Sandra Grey, says it’s time for both Te Pūkenga leaders
and the government to work out a better
approach.</p>

<p>“Our institutions are still working with a
broken funding model and we can’t wait for another 15
months for that to change. We need relief now. Money in so
that operating surpluses can be smaller.”</p>

<p>Unitec
have invited staff to give feedback on their announcement
with any proposals for change due when Auckland emerges from
lockdown.</p>
