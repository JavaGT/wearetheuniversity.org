<p>A UEI would eliminate the means testing and
heavy administration requirements associated with current
allowance model. In the model proposed by NZUSA, it would
increase the base allowance by $75 to truly reflect the cost
of living for students.</p>

<p>“We want to work with
Government to make sure students can afford to survive. But
they need to listen to the voices of students that are
crying out. There is not enough support for those in
tertiary education and every student knows this. The
Minister needs to wake up to this reality and help us”
says Lessells.</p>
