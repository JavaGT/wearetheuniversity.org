<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union, in
conjunction with NZUSA, Massey University and Academic
Freedom Aotearoa, have concluded an invigorating two-day
online conference with participants expressing a
determination to ‘keep the fire going’.</p>

<p>The
conference provided strong critiques of the structural and
institutional constraints on academic freedom, but ended
with a call to action that everyone involved hopes will
bring the tertiary sector together to focus on common
interests - advancing the public good, being the critic and
conscience of society, and having a responsibility to do so
because of academic freedom.</p>

<p>Panelist and facilitator
Siân Halcrow sums up the take-home message: “We need to
reimagine our tertiary education sector, our public good
contributions, and academic freedom from a uniquely Aotearoa
New Zealand perspective. The culture of fear academics have
been experiencing after many years of corporate style
management has got to end.”</p>

<p>But Halcrow also
stressed the need to understand the boundaries of academic
freedom. “We are committed to ensuring that the
responsibility we hold is practiced responsibly – with
strong critical engagement but ethically and with
manaaki.”</p>

<p>So where to from here? TEU Vice President
Julie Douglas stresses the importance of ensuring everyone
in the sector is on the same page. “The first step is to
make sure we have a definition of academic freedom that is
agreed and fit for purpose in Aotearoa. Students, staff,
vice chancellors and chief executives need to work together,
drawing on our shared values, for this mission. We also need
the support of the Minister of Education who wasn’t able
to join the forum, but we know he is ready to engage with us
in this conversation.”</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the
conference was to get back to a place where students and
staff in the tertiary education sector are practicing and
teaching academic freedom every day. It is hoped that we are
now on that path as a result of the past two
days.</p>
