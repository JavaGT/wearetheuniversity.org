<p>The
    survey is a result of work carried out over a number of
    months by NZUSA, TEU and TEAGA - with researchers from
    across Aotearoa - and aims to provide mechanisms to empower
    precarious workers in sharing their experiences and pushing
    for change.</p>

<p>Chair of TEAGA and Doctoral Scholar at the
    University of Auckland, Luke Oldfield, says “this survey
    is about establishing what those at the coalface view the
    tertiary sector as, and what the future of an academic
    career looks like in our universities. Until now, policy
    makers are relying on guess work as to determine the size
    and scope of precarity in the university sector. This is our
    chance to rectify that”.</p>

<p>The survey will run until
    October 22nd, 2021.</p>

<p>An interim report from the survey
    will be tabled in the first week of December.</p>
