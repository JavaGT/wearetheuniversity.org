everybody would like to follow me over
we're going to go around the back of the
hunter building um first we're going to
do a quick stop by the union building so
that everybody can drop their bags off
um also
cat here has got some templates that you
can give you they basically tell you
what your rights are because there will
be security guards and they will be
making areas here
so um
you just need to know you know what your
rights are and at the same time just
make sure you keep safe uh don't do
anything too crazy um if you've got any
bad plans but sweet we'll just head over
to the union building now that's cool
