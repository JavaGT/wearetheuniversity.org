<p>Auckland students oppose unrestrained fee
hikes</p>

<p>Auckland University Students are today shocked at
the news that the National Party wants to remove the current
policy of regulated fee maxima and allow universities to set
their own fees.<p>

<p>“We are deeply alarmed at signs of any
return to unrestrained fee rises. Students faced massive fee
hikes in the 1990s, contributing to student debt reaching $9
billion and growing,” says AUSA Education Vice President
David Do.</p>

<p>“National’s policy is particularly pertinent
to our students as the University of Auckland also charges
some of the highest fees in New Zealand. Under National’s
policy, this would get even worse.”</p>

<p>National in
government allowed institutions to set their own tuition
fees as well as reduced government funding. This led to
massive fees growth – the average annual university fee
increased from $1300 in 1992 to over $4000 by 2000.</p>

<p>90% of
Auckland students agreed or strongly agreed that tertiary
fees are too high, according to a recent Income and
Expenditure survey conducted by the New Zealand Union of
Student Associations.</p>

<p>“High fees are a major barrier to
accessing decent tertiary education. Resorting to the
‘market’ doesn’t address these issues and it wont
build a high-quality tertiary education system. Better
investment into universities will,” concludes Mr
Do.</p>

<p>National leader John Key should know better. As he
said to the National Party annual conference in Auckland in
August:<br>“I know from personal experience that education
is a liberator. Unless we ensure that every Kiwi is equipped
with a decent education, we are robbing them of a future."<p>
