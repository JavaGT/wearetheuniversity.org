<p>University staff welcome Hodgson into
tertiary education role</p>

<p>The Association of University
Staff (AUS) has welcomed the announcement that Pete Hodgson
has been named as the new Minister for Tertiary Education in
today’s Cabinet reshuffle. He has also been named as the
Minister in the allied fields of Research, Science and
Technology and Economic Development.</p>

<p>Mr Hodgson comes to
the portfolio with a wealth of Cabinet experience, including
most recently being the Minister of Health. Chris Carter has
been named as the new Minister of Education.</p>

<p>AUS National
President, Professor Nigel Haworth said that Mr Hodgson is
an experienced minister with a tremendous opportunity to
integrate the work of three related portfolios. “His
recent background in Health, in which tripartism plays a
growing role, equips him well to play a leading role in the
university tripartite process,” he said. “AUS looks
forward to working closely with Mr Hodgson as we have done
successfully with his predecessors.”</p>

<p>Professor Haworth
expressed his appreciation of the role played by the
outgoing Minister, Dr Michael Cullen. He said that Dr Cullen
had made a dynamic contribution by taking tangible and
productive steps to reform the tertiary education sector.
This included his active participating in developing a
process to address salary and funding
problems.</p>
