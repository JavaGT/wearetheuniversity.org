<p>University staff welcome Maharey
appointment</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has
welcomed the appointment of Steve Maharey as the next
Vice-Chancellor of Massey University, saying that his
appointment should benefit the entire university and
tertiary education sector.</p>

<p>It was announced today that Mr
Maharey, a former senior lecturer at the University, will
take up his appointment next year following the retirement
of the current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Judith
Kinnear.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Professor Nigel Haworth,
said that, as a former minister responsible for tertiary
education and the current Minister of Education, Mr Maharey
is ideally placed to lead one of New Zealand's major
universities.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that Mr Maharey was
responsible for the initiation of many of the current
reforms in the tertiary education sector, particularly
around the need for collaboration and in the recognition of
the distinctive contribution made by the different types of
institutions, necessary to benefit the country as a whole.<p>

<p>"Mr Maharey's experience and grasp of the issues facing
tertiary education will have equipped him with the skills
needed to provide strong leadership in Massey and in the
broader sector. He will add important understanding to the
work of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors' Committee,
particularly around the need for governance reform,
increased funding and greater cooperation between
institutions," he said. "Not only do we look forward to
working with Mr Maharey in the tripartite process, we also
look forward to him to show strong support for bargaining
multi-employer collective employment agreements within the
sector."</p>
