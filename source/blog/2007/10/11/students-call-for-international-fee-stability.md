	 <p>
         11 October 2007 - For Immediate Use</p><p>Students call for
international fee stability</p><p>As AUSA continues its
fee-setting campaign, students showed their support for the
grandparenting of international tuition fees this week, and
have also expressed concern at reduced levels of services
for international students.</p><p>At yesterday’s Student
Representative Council, students voted in favour of calling
on the University to grandparent its international fees.
</p><p>Grandparenting, as practised by other New Zealand
universities(AUT, Massey, and Waikato), means holding a
student's level of fees at the same level throughout the
normal course of their degree, rather than having them
increase every year. </p><p>“The University of Auckland claims
it ‘grandparents’ its fees by ‘capping’ fee rises at
5%. This is disingenuous to call it grandparenting because
it means continuous fee rises during the normal course of a
degree,” says Bethanie Maples, AUSA Acting
President.</p><p>“International students pay tens of thousands
of dollars in fees annually, so any percentage rise means a
large amount of money for students and their families. This
is money that students often divert from their normal living
costs, with negative impacts on their health and
well-being,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice
President.</p><p>Students also voiced their concern at recently
reduced opening hours for the International Students
Information Centre. </p><p>The centre, which provides a variety
of services for international students such as referral to
pastoral student support and other enquiries, had been open
8:30 to 5pm weekdays. Until further notice it will only be
open 9am to 2pm weekdays, almost a 50% cut in opening
hours.

<p>”Somehow it doesn’t seem right to reduce
service levels for international students when the
University is poised to increase their fees for yet another
year,” concludes David Do.</p><p>The University of Auckland
Council is meeting this Monday at 4pm to decide on 2008 fees
for domestic and international students. AUSA will be
holding a lively and visual student protest before this
meeting on Monday afternoon, at the University Clocktower on
Princes
Street.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
