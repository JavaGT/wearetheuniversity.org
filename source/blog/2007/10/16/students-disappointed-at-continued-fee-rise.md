         </p><p>Media Release - 16 October 2007 – For immediate
release</p><p>Students disappointed at continued fee
rise</p><p>Students are disappointed that the University of
Auckland has voted to increase domestic fees for
2008.</p><p>“Students are again left again holding the can –
bearing the brunt of the university raising fees by the
maximum allowable increase and government failing to
properly fund high-quality tertiary education,” says
Bethanie Maples, AUSA Acting President.</p><p>Despite student
opposition this afternoon, the Council still proceeded to
vote to increase fees by 2.7% undergraduate, and 7.2%
postgraduate, meaning an overall increase of 3.65%. Some
programmes at the postgraduate level, such as several
Masters and Honours programmes, were increased by
10.7%.</p><p>“While the percentage for domestic students was
less than recent years, this simply reflected the fact that
Auckland’s fees are the highest in the country,” says
David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.</p><p>“High and
rising fees are one of the root causes of New Zealand’s
high levels of student debt, due to exceed a whopping $9.4
billion shortly.”</p><p>--</p><p>Despite the fee rise, students
didn’t come away completely empty-handed from today’s
meeting.</p><p>Council did vote in favour of
resolutions(narrowly by 8-7 for the first one) put forward
by student reps David Do and Anna Crowe to:</p><p> “recognise
that high tuition fees and fee rises have significant
adverse social and economic impacts on students and the
wider community” d </p><p>“and further calls upon the
government to increase funding of the university sector to
adequately meet annual cost base increases within the
institutions,”

<p>“and resolve to collaborate more
closely with other sector organisations and
representatives(such as AUSA), who share their concerns
about sector underfunding to promote these concerns to
government.”</p><p>AUSA submitted detailed written submissions
to Council describing the negative impacts that fee rises
and high fees have on students and graduates.</p><p>“I am
pleased that Council has recognised that voting for fee
rises has significant adverse impacts beyond the fiscal
implications for the University itself,” says David Do,
AUSA Education Vice President.</p><p>“As AUSA President next
year, I am absolutely committed to campaigning for a better
deal for students – not just increasing access to student
allowances, but also increasing funding to ensure
high-quality tertiary education and lower fees for the
future.”</p><p>ENDS<br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
