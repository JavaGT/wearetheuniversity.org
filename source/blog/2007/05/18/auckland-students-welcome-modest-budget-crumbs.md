<p>Auckland students welcome modest Budget
crumbs</p>

<p>Auckland students welcomed yesterday’s Budget
announcement to increase access to full student allowances
as a step in the right direction, as well as increased
funding to ensure universities can retain high-quality
teaching and research staff.</p>

<p>“While any movement on
allowances is welcome, a ‘full’ student allowance barely
covers the necessary rent and living costs in a city like
Auckland,” says AUSA President Lesieli Oliver.<p>

<p>“Today’s Budget announcement falls far short of
ensuring all students are adequately supported while
studying, without having to borrow living costs off their
student loan or resorting to long hours of part-time work,
just to pay for rent and food.”</p>

<p>Labour promised last
election that they would ensure that 50% of full time
students would receive allowances; it is currently less than
30%. AUSA calls on the government to honour its manifesto
promise.</p>

<p>There is also increased funding to help retain
and attract top-quality staff, and allow universities to
concentrate on their strengths</p>

<p>“Our students are justly
proud of the quality of education they receive at a top
university like the University of Auckland. It’s good to
see that some government funding has focused on quality,”
says AUSA Education Vice President David Do.</p>

<p>“Students
were badly affected by staff strikes in 2005, so its
pleasing to see positive funding outcomes from collaboration
through the Tripartite Forum.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, having
the best teachers doesn’t mean a thing if you’re too
hungry and tired to learn.”</p>

<p>No substantial
above-inflation increase in university funding was announced
in the Budget - this will most likely lead to continued
tuition fee rises for students at the end of this
year.</p>
