	 <p>
         23 May 2007</p><p>University research ranking row “unseemly”
</p><p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) says that the
continuing public debate between university vice-chancellors
about their research rankings shows that the competitive
model in the university system is divisive and undermines
the Government’s Tertiary Education Strategy, which calls
for a national university sector based on
collaboration.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Tertiary Education
Commission released the latest Performance-Based Research
Fund (PBRF) rankings, which saw the University of Otago rise
from fourth to first, the position previously held by the
University of Auckland </p><p>Since the release of the rankings,
the University of Auckland’s advertising has continued to
assert that it is the top university in New Zealand for
research, with its Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart
McCutcheon, reported as alleging that any system of ranking
was open to “management”. </p><p>University of Otago
Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Skegg, has hit back,
accusing Auckland’s advertising of being misleading,
adding that it must be awkward for Auckland being ranked at
number two when all of its marketing is based on being New
Zealand’s number one university.</p><p>The AUS National
President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said that the argument
between the two vice-chancellors over which was the better
research institution was an unseemly spat which did nothing
to enhance the reputation of quality of the New Zealand
university system. “In fact, all universities have
improved their research output and there is little, if any,
difference between the top universities,” he said.
“Rather than allowing the current squabbling to continue,
university councils should now step in and ensure that
research efforts enhance the university system, rather than
allow them to be used as the basis of
competition.”</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
