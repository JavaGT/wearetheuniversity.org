<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Release</p>

<p>Attn

<p>University staff welcome extra funding</p>

<p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the
announcement today by the Minister for Tertiary Education,
Dr Michael Cullen, that universities will receive $129
million in new funding over the next four years.<p>

<p>Of that
new funding, $20 million has been specifically allocated to
the University Tripartite Forum this year to explore and
create opportunities to increase the competitiveness of New
Zealand universities through recruitment and retention
strategies.<p>

<p>Responding to today’s pre-Budget
announcement, AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly said that
the unions representing university staff had successfully
engaged with vice-chancellors and the Government over the
past two years through the tripartite process and had made
significant gains towards addressing funding and salary
problems in the university sector. “The new funding
allocation will assist us to continue to address salary
issues and allow us to develop a broader agenda that will
provide additional benefits for the sector,” she said.
“The union is pleased that the Government recognises that
universities are under funded and is looking at long-term
sustainable solutions.”</p>

<p>According to Ms Kelly, today’s
funding announcement illustrates what can be achieved when
unions, vice-chancellors and the Government work together.
“We know that the tripartite process has been successful
in achieving consensus and providing results for
universities, including university staff,” she said.<p>
<p>Ms
Kelly said that AUS will now work with the New Zealand
Vice-Chancellors Committee to determine the implications of
today’s announcement for the current bargaining process.<p>

<p>Dr Cullen also announced today that student component
funding to universities would increase by 2.2 percent next
year, in line with current consumer price index figures.  He
also announced $10 million dollars this year that would be
available for supporting change in the
sector.</p>
