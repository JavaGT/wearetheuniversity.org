<p>Media Release</p>

<p><br>Performance Based Research Fund – The
Good, The Bad and the Not Worth It.</p>

<p>The President of the
Association of University Staff today called on the
Government to consider seriously whether or not a further
round of assessment for the Performance Based Research Fund
in 2012 would really be worth the cost and
effort.</p>

<p>“Results released today from the 2006 PBRF round
should convince Government that another round of PBRF in its
current form would not be worth doing,” said Association
of University Staff Academic President Nigel
Haworth.</p>

<p>“Today’s results have good news, bad news and
news not worth knowing,” he said. “The good news is that
all universities have shown high levels of improvement in
research outputs from the already high base shown in the
2003 results,” he said.  “The Government and the public
can rest assured that universities are the leading research
institutions in this country, and investment in them pays
off and is money well spent.”<p>

<p>“The bad news is that
lots of the information produced by the PBRF is not relevant
and is misleading in terms of any person looking to choose
the ‘best’university or the ‘best’ teacher of a
particular subject.  There are so many variables that lead
to the various results that the information is not
reliable,” he said.  “For example, the Carey Baptist
College came in at number nine on the quality league tables
yet it only submitted five portfolios and only three of its
staff received quality scores.   At number eight (one higher
than Carey), AUT submitted 243 portfolios including six A
grade researchers, the two are simply not
comparable.”<p>
<p>“The part of the exercise ‘not worth
it’ is the cost of finding out what many already know –
that universities are performing well and doing the bulk of
the research in this country.  AUS members spent thousands
of hours preparing portfolios for PBRF assessment,
universities have full time staff managing this exercise and
the TEC reported today that over 200 people were involved in
this year’s assessment – and all to find out what should
be clear – universities are doing great research.  A
simpler and cheaper system must be devised that saves the
best and ditches the rest,”said Nigel Haworth.</p>

<p>AUS will
participate in the upcoming review of this year’s PBRF
round and hopes to provide some new ideas to improve the
system.</p>
