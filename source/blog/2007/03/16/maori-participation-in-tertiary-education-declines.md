<p>Maori participation in tertiary education declines</p>

<p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has called for an
improvement in the rates of Maori participation in
tertiary-education. This follows the publication of a series
of fact sheets by the Ministry of Education showing that,
while Maori participation rates were proportionately higher
than other groups, the actual numbers of Maori student
enrolments in 2005 had decreased by 1,860, or 3.4 percent,
equivalent full-time students from 2004.<p>

<p>Te
Kahurangi Whaiti, the Maori sector of AUS, said the fact
sheets also showed that the numbers of Maori enrolling in
bachelor degrees had decreased by 0.2% between 2004 and
2005.</p>

<p>AUS Maori Officer, Naomi Manu said concerns
arose over the fact that the majority of Maori learners are
still concentrated in the lower levels of tertiary-education
and that Maori students at bachelors level are more likely
to be aged twenty-five years and over. She said that Maori
participation at lower levels of tertiary education comes as
a result of secondary schooling failing Maori.  “Many
Maori are constantly in catch-up mode, so that, rather than
entering at higher levels, many Maori enter tertiary
education to receive the education and training that they
should have received at school.”<p>

<p>”With the
omission of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Te Rautaki Matauranga
Maori in the new Tertiary Education Strategy, and also the
withdrawal of Manaaki Tauira, we remain concerned that Maori
participation will continue to decline,” Mrs Manu
said.</p>
