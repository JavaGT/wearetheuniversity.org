28 March 2007</p><p><br>University staff support call for urgent
action to curb mounting student debt</p><p><br>The Association
of University Staff (AUS) has joined the call for urgent
government intervention to deal with the mounting level of
student debt, saying that students, just like any other
group of citizens, should have sufficient levels of income
to live while studying. This follows the announcement this
morning that the total level of debt for New Zealand
students has reached $9 billion.</p><p>AUS National President,
Professor Nigel Haworth, said that he was shocked that
student debt has reached the $9 billion mark, adding that it
represents a significant failure by New Zealanders to
support adequately students through their tertiary
education.</p><p>Professor Haworth said that university staff
had consistently expressed concerns about the effect of high
student loans and debt on students’ access to university
education and on their learning experience. “It is clear
that increasing access to adequate living allowances for
students and lowering student fees would considerably reduce
the level of total student debt,” he said. “University
staff  believe these changes are necessary to ensure the
high educational standards needed for a knowledge-based
society.”</p><p>While recognising that the Government has
increased support for students through measures such as the
interest-free loans policy, Professor Haworth said that the
AUS supported calls by the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations for the Government to deal with the drivers of
student debt and implement measures such as a universal
living allowance for all
students.</p><p>ENDS
