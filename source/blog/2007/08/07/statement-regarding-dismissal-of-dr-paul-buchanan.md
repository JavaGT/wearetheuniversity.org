<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Advisory<br>6 August
2007</p>

<p>Statement regarding the dismissal of Dr Paul
Buchanan, University of Auckland</p>

<p>In response to media
enquiry in relation to the dismissal of Dr Paul Buchanan
from his position as a lecturer in Political Studies at the
University of Auckland, the Association of University Staff
makes the following points.</p>

<p>Dr Buchanan is a highly
respected academic with a high public profile.</p>

<p>We can
confirm that Dr Buchanan sent an email to a student about
which a complaint was made. Dr Buchanan has apologized to
both the student and the University regarding this
email.</p>

<p>There are extenuating circumstances surrounding the
sending of the email, and the University had a range of
options open to it other than to dismiss Dr Buchanan.</p>

<p>The
Association of University staff does not believe Dr Buchanan
should have been dismissed from his position.</p>

<p>Dr
Buchananâ€™s dismissal is being appealed.</p>

<p>There will be no
further public comment on this matter at this
time</p>
