<p>International report shows more
investment needed in tertiary education</p>

<p>New Zealand’s
runs the risk of slipping behind other international
economies if it does not increase its investment in tertiary
education and research and development, according to the
Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>AUS National
President. Professor Nigel Haworth, said that data released
this week by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) showed that New Zealand continues to rank
poorly internationally in its public investment in tertiary
education and its private investment in research and
development.</p>

<p>The latest edition of the annual OECD report,
Education at a Glance, shows that New Zealand consistently
ranks around the middle of the thirty OECD countries
compared across a variety of measures in what is described
as a compendium of international education indicators
looking at the quality, quantity, equity and efficiency of
education systems.<p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that New
Zealand ranked particularly poorly in research and
development, with only 1.1 percent of gross domestic product
invested, against an OECD average of 2.3 percent. “The
report shows, however, that the Government provides 50
percent of the funding for investment in research and
development against an OECD average of only 30 percent,”
he said. “This must serve a wake-up call for industry if
New Zealand is to realize its aspirations for economic
transformation and to maintain a position as a strong OECD
nation.”<p>
<p>Professor Haworth also said that, although the
Government has increased expenditure on tertiary education,
it still had further to go. “The report reveals that New
Zealand’s expenditure per student on tertiary education,
adjusted for purchasing power parity, is $US8,866, against
an OECD average of $US11,100. The United States leads the
field, investing $US22,476 per full-time student,” he
said. “The report also shows that New Zealand is one of a
number of countries which has increased participation in
tertiary education by relying more on the financial
contributions of students and households.”</p>

<p>In terms of
student to staff ratios, Professor Haworth said that New
Zealand falls well below the pack. “Against an OECD
average of 15.8 students to one staff member, New Zealand
records 18.2 students per staff member. It is the fifth
worst student to staff ratio recorded, although a
significant way behind Greece at thirty to one,” he
said.</p>
