<p>International report calls for
collaboration between tertiary-education organisations</p>

<p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed an
international report raising concerns about academic
workloads in universities and suggesting that there be
greater collaboration between institutions to foster
mobility for academic staff.</p>

<p>The Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Thematic Review of
Tertiary Education in New Zealand, which was released today,
recognises the importance of tertiary-education staff in
ensuring the quality of New Zealand institutions, and
identifies a number of issues that need to be tackled in
order to maintain this quality.<p>

<p>The report sets out five
main areas where work demands are perceived to be expanding.
They are compliance requirements and information requests,
administrative duties associated with the introduction of
new systems and changes to university policies, increasing
numbers of programme and paper offerings, increased
workloads resulting from the variety of delivery modes
supported by the university and increasing demand for a
longer teaching year.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Professor
Nigel Haworth said that a number of conclusions reached in
the report would form the basis of on-going discussions
between the union and university management, government and
education officials. “While this report contains many
positive comments about the tertiary-education sector, it
identifies a number of pressure points which must be
addressed,” he said. “Many of these relate to staff and
workloads, and we support the view of the OECD that the
solution lies in resolving issues through collaboration
across the sector and not trying to resolve them at the
level of individual institutions.”<p>
