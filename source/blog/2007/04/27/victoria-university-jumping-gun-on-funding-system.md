<p>Victoria University Jumping Gun on New
Funding System</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS)
is concerned that Victoria University is  acting
precipitously in assuming that the  new tertiary funding
system will cause them disadvantage and by embarking on wide
scale reviews at the University before all the detail is
known.<p>

<p>AUS National President Professor Haworth said
that AUS supported the new funding regime which provides
more funding certainty than the current competitive “bums
on seats” model.  He said the current model has failed the
sector and he welcomed the fact that universities will no
longer be dependent on student numbers alone to determine
funding. “The new funding model including the three year
funding cycle will help universities avoid the abrupt review
exercises that Victoria proposed today,” he said.<p>

<p>“Our members have suffered greatly from the unfettered
growth model driven by the ‘bums on seats’ funding
regime and its debilitating race for more students. There
has been no national consideration of what might be needed
from the university sector,” he said.  “When student
numbers go up, class sizes get bigger and when student
numbers go down, endless restructuring and job loss
occurs,” he said.  “The new model removes the
competition for students and, with its emphasis on quality
provision in a more stable environment, will be better for
New Zealand and will provide more security for staff”.<p>
<p>He called on universities to work together to develop a
single plan for a single university system in which each
university plays to its strengths and supports each
other’s programmes.  “What we have seen from Victoria
today is more of the same,” he said.  “The
Vice-Chancellor does not know what the new funding level
will be for the University next year and has made an
assumption that no growth will be funded.  Our assumption is
that growth in areas of strength and importance to Victoria
will be funded, and growth simply intended to increase
revenue will not.  Our members care about a system that is
stable and sustainable, and based on quality provision,”
Professor Haworth said.<p>

<p>Professor Haworth said he
believed the new system was much more likely to enable sound
new investment in the sector from the Government. “This is
what the sector needs and is the substance of the successful
tripartite model in the sector, involving the tertiary
union, Vice-Chancellors and Government.<p>
