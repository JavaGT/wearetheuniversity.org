<p><br></p><h3>University employment agreements ratified</h3><p>New
collective employment agreements have been ratified for
academic and general staff at the eight New Zealand
universities.<p>

<p>Provisional figures show that more than 97
percent of those participating in ratification ballots voted
in favour of settlements at Auckland, Waikato, Massey,
Victoria, Canterbury, Lincoln, Otago and AUT Universities.
The ratification will see salary increases for academic
staff of between 5.2 and 6.2 percent and between 3.73 and
4.73 percent for general staff over the course of the year.<p>

<p>The settlements comprise a salary component funded by
each university and another from a new government funding
package of $20 million, allocated through the Universities
Tripartite Forum this year to explore and create
opportunities to increase the competitiveness of New Zealand
universities through recruitment and retention strategies.<p>

<p>The spokesperson for the combined university unions,
Nanette Cormack, said that the unions representing
university staff had successfully engaged with
vice-chancellors and the Government over the past two years
through the tripartite process and are making satisfactory
gains towards addressing funding and salary problems in the
university sector.</p>

<p>According to Ms Cormack, the
settlements illustrate what can be achieved when unions,
vice-chancellors and the Government work together. "We know
that the tripartite process has been successful in achieving
consensus and providing results for university staff," she
said.<p>
<p>Ms Cormack said that, while the salary increases
varied among universities and between academics and general
staff, she believed that union members saw the settlements
as a positive step towards resolving long-term salary
problems. "Union members know that the government money,
which funded a proportion of the increases, was a direct
result of efforts made over the past three years," she said.<p>

<p>"The ballot result shows strong support for the national
approach to bargaining and gives us confidence to continue
with that
process."</p>
