<p><b> Shutting The University Doors – Students Say NO
</b></p>

<p>Auckland students are extremely concerned by, and
will oppose, moves to eliminate open entry into the
University of Auckland from 2009.</p>

<p>The University has
proposed that entry to the degrees of Arts, Education, Law
Part 1 and Theology be limited from 2009 onwards,
effectively removing open entry into the University of
Auckland. The exact details of these limitations would be
worked out later. The University’s Senate(or Academic
Board) will be debating the proposal this Monday afternoon
from 4pm.</p>

<p>“We oppose removing open entry to these
degrees because we believe universities should be open to
all who are able and willing to study,” says David Do,
AUSA Education Vice President.</p>

<p>“We are shutting the door
on the potential students and achievers of the future. We
are denying them the chance to make their mark on the world.
Total limited entry means many students will not get the
chance to get a higher education and succeed at a university
of their choice,” says AUSA President Lesieli Oliver.</p>

<p>“Any limitations exercise would inevitably concentrate
on a student’s grades from high school. But high school
performance doesn’t guarantee a similar performance at
University. For example, high-achieving ‘quality’
students can find the University environment difficult, and
may drop out.”</p>

<p>AUSA is appalled at the absence of
consultation with students. The proposal is going through
University committees at the end of the year, after students
have finished their study and exams. Students would be most
directly affected by any changes, but have no way of
effectively having their say on this important
issue.</p>

<p>“The University has failed to meaningfully
consult with key stakeholders such as students. The only
student to have seen this proposal in detail is the student
representative who sits on these committees – me!” says
David
Do.</p>
