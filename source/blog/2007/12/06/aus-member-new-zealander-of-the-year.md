Attn Education Reporter		6 December 2007</p><p><br>AUS member
New Zealander of the Year</p><p>Professor Philip Bagshaw, from
the University of Otago was today named as New Zealander of
the Year by North and South Magazine. The award was
announced at a breakfast in Christchurch this morning by the
magazine’s editor Virginia Larsen.</p><p>Professor Bagshaw, a
medical academic at the Christchurch School of Medicine, was
adjudged the top New Zealander from more than fifty nominees
and described by the magazine as a surgeon, humanitarian and
reluctant activist. </p><p>The award follows the opening this
year of the Christchurch Charity hospital which has been the
culmination of a career in which Professor Bagshaw has been
renowned for fighting for the rights of hospital patients
and working people. “Some call him a saint, others a
Samaritan, while he labels himself a socialist,” says
North and South.</p><p>In 1997, Professor Bagshaw was one of
three Christchurch doctors to receive an Association of
University Staff Academic Freedom award following the
publication of a damning report, Patients are dying which
outlined chronic failures at Christchurch Hospital.</p><p>In
accepting his award, Professor Bagshaw said that, in the
1990’s, social engineers tried to destroy the community
spirit of New Zealanders and replace it with a selfish,
self-centered view. “But the message is clear,” he said,
“they failed. The flame of community spirit still alive
and I hope it will spread like a contagion throughout
society.”

<p>AUS National President, Professor Nigel
Haworth congratulated Professor Bagshaw on his award, saying
that his actions were in the best traditions of academic
freedom and engagement, particularly in his willingness to
confront politicians and bureaucrats with powerful,
evidence-based arguments in favour of the public health
system, and medicine in general. “Added to that, he is
recognised as a superb university teacher, taking out top
teaching awards on a number of occasions,” he
said.</p><p><br>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
