<p>Media Release - 13 December 2007 - For Immediate
Use</p>

<p>Students welcome tertiary transport
discounts</p>

<p>Auckland students are ecstatic at recently
announced public transport discounts for tertiary students,
which will collectively save students thousands of dollars
annually.</p>

<p>The Auckland Regional Transport Authority has
recently announced that full-time tertiary students will now
get a 40% discount off the normal adult fare on ten-trip
tickets, up from the current 20% discount.</p>

<p>While the exact
fares are not finalised yet, a back-of-the-envelope
calculation of the new discount suggests that for a student
living in the suburbs, who lives 2 stages from the
University, and travels twice a day to and from University
every weekday using a ten-trip pass, will save $11 a week
off the current adult fare(or $8 off the current tertiary
fare). Over the academic year of 25 weeks of classes, this
amounts to savings of up to $285 a year(or $197.50 off the
current tertiary fare).</p>

<p>“Many of our students struggle
to get by on a limited income through the student allowance
or borrowing off their student loans for living costs.
Transport is one of the major costs our students face, so
this is most welcome news,” says David Do, AUSA Education
Vice President.</p>

<p>“Any cost-benefit analysis shows it is
much cheaper to use public transport than to drive,
maintain, and park a private car. These discounts cement
this cost saving further.”</p>

<p>Cheaper public transport has
many benefits apart from economic. Increased use of public
transport has environmental benefits, reduces traffic
congestion, and reduces the need to use expensive inner-city
carparking.<p>

<p>“Students applaud these moves to encourage
sustainable public
transport.”</p>
