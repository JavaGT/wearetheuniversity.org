         THE AUCKLAND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' ASSOCIATION (INC.)<br>TE
ROOPU TAUIRA O TE WHARE WAANANGA O TAMAKI
MAKAURAU<br>www.ausa.auckland.ac.nz</p><p>Media Release - 4
December 2007 - For Immediate Use</p><p>Senate votes to
eliminate open entry, students vow to fight on</p><p>Auckland
students are disappointed that the University of Auckland
Senate voted to approve a proposal to eliminate open entry
into the University from 2009. </p><p>Today’s Senate meeting
lasted more than two hours, and was marked by strong debate
and passionate expression of views. Those who spoke were
mostly against the proposal. In the end however, Senate
voted overwhelmingly for the proposal. Student
representatives and some professors voted
against.</p><p>“While we didn’t win the vote, we’re
pleased Senate at least gave some pause to the myriad issues
surrounding this,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice
President.</p><p>The Senate also agreed to a ‘compromise’
measure that would set up a cross-faculty Taskforce to look
specifically at equity issues involved in a limited entry
scheme. This taskforce would report back to the March
Senate.</p><p>Student representatives do not believe the
Taskforce is an adequate solution to the issues that have
been raised.</p><p>“Once again it’s the cart before the
horse. This was a last minute addition raised at the meeting
itself. We’re not convinced this is a genuine attempt to
look at the real issues, especially as it reports back
months after a final decision may have already been made,”
says David Do.

<p>“We don’t even know exactly what its
terms of references will be, or who exactly will be on it.
We’re concerned that this will become a toothless talkfest
with no real power to effect changes on the eventual design
of the limitations scheme.”</p><p>Nevertheless, AUSA hopes
that student representatives will be part of this Taskforce,
if only to ensure the body includes a strong student-focused
perspective.</p><p>The proposal to eliminate open entry now goes
to a final decision at the University of Auckland Council on
the 10th, where student representatives there will continue
to raise the significant issues associated with this
proposal.</p><p>ENDS<br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
