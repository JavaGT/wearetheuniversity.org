<p>Media Release - 11 December 2007 - For Immediate Use</p>

<p><b>
Students Slam University For Slamming The Doors To
Opportunity Shut</b></p>

<p>Auckland students are upset and
disappointed that the University of Auckland Council has
voted to eliminate open entry into the University from 2009.<p>

<p>Council voted overwhelmingly for the proposal despite
strong representations by the two student representatives,
David Do and Anna Crowe, who were also the only ones to vote
against the proposal.</p>

<p>“We’re saddened by this result
because this shows that the University has failed to
acknowledge the legitimate concerns of students and the
community,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice
President.</p>

<p>“This three-page proposal was rammed through
in just over three weeks without proper consultation or
consideration of the impact this decision would have.
Students are angry they never got a real say in this
important issue.”</p>

<p>Concerned students and members of the
public packed out the Council chamber today to listen to the
debate on the proposal, after staging a creative protest
inside the Clocktower building. There was also significant
media interest in the Council meeting.<p>

<p>“The fact that
this proposal has generated so much interest in the
community demonstrates that there are very significant
issues at stake and we don’t feel that those issues have
been resolved”, says Anna Crowe, the other student
representative on
Council.</p>
