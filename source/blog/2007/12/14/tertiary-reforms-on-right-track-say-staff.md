<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Tertiary education reforms on right
track, say university staff</p>

<p>University staff have welcomed
today’s announcement by the Tertiary Education Commission
(TEC) that high-quality tertiary education is vital for New
Zealand’s economic transformation and social development
goals, and that universities will be expected to provide a
broad mix of education.</p>

<p>The TEC today released the details
of new, three-year, planning and funding arrangements for
tertiary education organisations, which will see
universities receive an additional 5.4 percent, or $60
million, in funding next year.<p>

<p>Association of University
Staff (AUS) National President, Professor Nigel Haworth,
said that, staff would be particularly pleased that the
Government has set out its clear intention that students who
want to go to university can continue to do so. “Given
speculation over the last two weeks that enrolments may be
limited at some universities, it is heartening to see that
they are being required to look at ways to increase the
participation and achievement by under-represented groups,
particularly Māori and Pasifika,” he said. “While some
universities may be considering restricting enrolments, an
enrolment management process will be put in place which will
not permit equity programmes to be
compromised.”</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that the investment
plans, negotiated between individual institutions and the
TEC, are clearly focused on increasing participation in
university study, increasing postgraduate student numbers
and requiring universities to increase their engagement with
stakeholders to improve the relevance of education on offer
and the research being undertaken.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said
that the AUS has long argued for an integrated approach to
national university provision, which should replace the
competitive model currently driving university
decision-making. A co-operative model in tune with academic
endeavor and national needs is needed, adding that the
reforms announced today should go some considerable way to
achieving
this.</p>
