         Media Release</p><p>17 November 2009</p><p>Student marks now in
danger from polytechnic strikes</p><p>Tertiary Education Union
members at Waikato Institute of Technology have voted today
to withhold student marks as part of their ongoing
industrial action.&nbsp; They join their colleagues at Unitec
and Whitireia Polytechnic in the withholding of all student
assessment marks and will not participate in any processing
of marks.&nbsp; Union members at the three polytechnics and
three other polytechnics, Bay of Plenty Polytechnic,
NorthTec and Western Institute of Technology have been
involved in a long running dispute with their employers over
an attempt to protect their existing working conditions from
being eroded.</p><p>Staff at the six polytechnics resumed
industrial action two weeks ago and have been involved in
prolonged strikes ever since. Staff are seeking to retain
their existing working conditions and leave entitlements as
well as an improved pay increase.&nbsp; Employers are seeking to
remove some of their academic staff’s working conditions
and are currently offering a 2 percent pay increase over two
years.</p><p>“The last thing lecturers want to do is to
undermine their students’ learning,” said Tertiary
Education Union national industrial officer Irena Brorens,
“and they certainly don’t want to withhold assessment
marks, but the employers are leaving them with no choice.
They are taking this action to protect our long standing
working conditions that allow them to be good teachers and
to give the best education they can to students in their
local communities.”</p><p>“Withholding assessment marks is a
legitimate and legal industrial action, although one that we
strongly regret needing to
use.”</p><p>Ends</p><p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
