         Media Release<br>17 November 2009</p><p>SIS asks university
staff to watch for foreign agents</p><p>The New Zealand Security
Intelligence Service (SIS) has been approaching universities
seeking their help to prevent foreign states getting their
hands on technology associated with weapons of mass
destruction. </p><p>Director of the SIS, Dr Warren Tucker, sent
a letter dated 6 November to various university managers. In
it he notes that the SIS recently met with the New Zealand
Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, and sought the
vice-chancellors’ help in alerting the SIS to any
‘illicit science’ relating to the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.  </p><p>An accompanying brochure,
called ‘A Guide to Weapons of Mass Destruction: Your role
in preventing proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction’, warns scientists and researchers to look out
for individuals at their institution or elsewhere who may be
trying to gain the skills, technology, or knowledge to
develop a weapon of mass destruction.</p><p>TEU president Dr Tom
Ryan says copies of the letter and pamphlet appear to have
been distributed widely in science and related departments
at universities. They include phone, fax, email, and web
contacts for the SIS.</p><p>“The SIS pretends that it should
be considered normal for staff to report back to a spy
agency. But such a practice would undermine the legislated
autonomy of our institutions, including the guarantee of
academic freedom. It also may lead to some members of the
academic community being targeted because of their religion,
nationality, or ethnicity.”

<p>“If any tertiary staff
member sees something they suspect is illegal they should
contact the police. Otherwise their job is to advance and
share knowledge; it is not to create an atmosphere where
colleagues and students don’t know whether they are being
spied on or not. That can only inhibit genuine education and
research,” said Dr Ryan.</p><p>He also criticised the SIS and
the NZVCC for failing to consult with the TEU on their
plans. “This scheme is almost a re-run of what happened in
2006 when the SIS and the NZVCC likewise convinced
themselves they did not need to take the views of staff and
students into account on a similar matter. We thought they
had learned their lesson, if belatedly, then – both
clearly have very short
memories.”</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
