	 <p>
         Media Release<br>2 November 2009<br>Tertiary bosses had
profitable 2008</p><p>Some large remuneration increases for the
chief executives and vice chancellors in the tertiary
education sector during 2008 are revealed in the State
Services Commission’s just released Annual Report.</p><p>The
University of Auckland’s vice-chancellor saw his total
remuneration band improve from $520,000-$529,999 to
$560,000-$569,999.  That’s a minimum of 5.6 percent for
the year – significantly more than the 2.6 percent pay
rise he then offered his staff a few months later.</p><p>At the
University of Otago the vice-chancellor’s remuneration
improved by at least $60,000, and the two vice-chancellors
that were employed at the University of Canterbury took home
a combined total over $710,000 between them.</p><p>The Waikato
Institute of Technology, already one of the highest paid
chief executives at a polytechnic found his remuneration had
improved by at least $30,000. Others to see large percentage
rises in remuneration included those in charge at the
Manukau Institute of Technology, Te Wānanga o Aotearoa,
polytechnics at Christchurch and Whitireia, and the
universities of Waikato and Victoria. </p><p>TEU national
secretary Sharn Riggs says the figures add urgency to the
need to treat other staff in the sector fairly. </p><p>“While
some institutions appear to have shown restraint others have
been offering very large increases to their chief executives
and vice chancellors which goes to show that the State
Services Commission is willing to offer its chief executives
significantly larger percentage remuneration increases than
it is willing to endorse for other
staff.”</p><p>ENDS
