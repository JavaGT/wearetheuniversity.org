         Media Release<br>30 November 2009</p><p>Taskforce opts for
ignorance over education</p><p>The 2025 Taskforce's prescription
for tertiary education assumes that New Zealand can reach
the Taskforce's goal of economic parity with Australia by
educating fewer people and lowering the quality of the
public education that New Zealanders receive. The taskforce,
which made its recommendations today, was set up by Prime
Minister John Key and led by former National Party leader
Don Brash with the goal of bridging the income gap with
Australia by 2025.</p><p>The taskforce calls for higher tertiary
education fees, market interest on student loans, changing
the democratic governance of tertiary institutions, and less
public oversight of the quality of education that our
students receive.</p><p>"Seemingly the Taskforce thinks the path
to economic parity with Australia is a low-skill,
low-productivity path," said Tertiary Education Union
president Dr Tom Ryan.</p><p>"This stands in stark contrast to
Australia, where its federal government is investing tens of
billions of dollars encouraging people into tertiary
education, and taking active steps to remove barriers that
prevent people studying."</p><p>"These recommendations, combined
with the broader calls to savagely cut government spending,
to reduce wages and weaken employment rights, suggest the
taskforce has taken very little notice of the 'lucky'
country it is supposedly trying to emulate," said Dr
Ryan.</p><p>ENDS
