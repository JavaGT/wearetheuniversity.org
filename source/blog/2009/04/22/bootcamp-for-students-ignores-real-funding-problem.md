         Media Release<br>22 April 2009</p><p>Bootcamp for tertiary
students ignores real funding problem</p><p>It seems boot camps
are not just for students who don’t want to be in
education – they are also now for those who do. That’s
the sentiment of TEU national secretary, Sharn Riggs, in
response to a government proposal that school leavers be
offered a gap year in the military to pay for their tertiary
education.</p><p>“The government, rather than encouraging
students into tertiary education study, is now telling them
that they first need to spend a year in the
territorials.”</p><p>“It’s outrageous that the government
has seemingly given up on the widely accepted goal that
tertiary education should be accessible to all on the basis
of ability not wallet size.  If the government really wants
more people to study then why not pay for it directly rather
than telling people they should first spend a year or so in
the military.” </p><p>“No disrespect to the territorials –
the professional work our armed forces do around the world
is widely respected, but I am sure they have got better
things to do than to babysit students who can’t afford the
growing student fees that government encourages tertiary
education institutions to
charge.”</p><p>ENDS
