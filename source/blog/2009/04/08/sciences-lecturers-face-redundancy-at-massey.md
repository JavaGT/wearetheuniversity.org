	 <p>
         Media Release<br>8 April 2009</p><p>Sciences lecturers face
redundancy at Massey</p><p>News that Massey University
intends to make six horticulture, agriculture and earth
science staff redundant flies in the face of its own
professed commitment to helping New Zealanders into jobs
says TEU president Dr Tom Ryan.</p><p>Massey University
last week announced its intention to restructure its
Institute of Natural Resources. Twelve academic staff
positions are under review, six of which are scheduled to be
lost and eleven of the staff affected are TEU members.  The
Institute of Natural Resources combines agricultural and
horticultural science and ecology. It teaches and researches
sustainable production and conservation of natural
resources.</p><p>“Massey’s vice chancellor Steve
Maharey speaks publicly about his university’s role in
creating a sustainable future by investing in science, of
the need to develop the nation's food research expertise,
and tells the government to focus on keeping people in
jobs,” stated Dr Ryan. “But on his own campus he is
letting go of lecturers and researchers who are teaching and
researching the very area of applied science he and others
espouse so strongly.”</p><p>“The vice chancellor
should read his own speeches more carefully.  At this time
we need staff like this more than ever,” said TEU’s
Massey branch president, Barry Foster.  </p><p>“New
Zealand’s economic, environmental, and social future is
closely connected to teaching and research in the earth
sciences. Is Massey intimidated by the proposed
Lincoln-AgResearch merger? Have we now given up competing in
that field?” Mr. Foster asked.</p><p>ENDS
