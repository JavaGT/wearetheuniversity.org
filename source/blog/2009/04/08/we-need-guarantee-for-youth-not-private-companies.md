<p>Media Release<br>8 April 2009</p>

<p>We need a guarantee for
youth, not for private companies</p>

<p>The National-led
government’s proposed Youth Guarantee Scheme, which aims
to offer alternative education options for 16 and 17 year
olds, needs to make sure it doesn’t move young adults out
of our public education system simply so they can become a
commodity for private companies, warns TEU President Dr Tom
Ryan. His comments follow statements by the government in
recent weeks that it wishes to “fast track” the
scheme.</p>

<p>“Giving teenagers options that keep them in
education is a great aim that we all agree with, but I’d
be worried if fly-by-night private providers started mopping
up students between secondary school and polytechnic because
the government was in a hurry to introduce a policy before
the framework was in place” said Ryan.</p>

<p>He went on to say
that the scheme was to be closely integrated with five new
trades academies around the country, but four of these
academies are not yet up and running. The Minister of
Education, Anne Tolley, has only just called for expressions
of interest to establish them.<p>

<p>“There are a number of
already well-established programmes that address the link
between secondary and tertiary education, such as STAR, that
the minister could support instead to ensure they continue
to provide a quality service to students. Polytechnics also
could help but enrolments in most of them are already up
near the the limit of their student cap”, said Dr Ryan.<p>

<p>“New Zealand has an integrated and respected public
education system that stretches from early childhood to
tertiary.  It’s important that the Youth Guarantee Scheme
does not allow second-rate private providers to mop up
students simply because officialdom wants them out of the
school gates but off the
streets.”</p>
