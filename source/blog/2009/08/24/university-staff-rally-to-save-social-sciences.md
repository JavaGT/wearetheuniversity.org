<p><b>Victoria University staff rally to save social
sciences</b></p>

<p>Staff, alumni and students at the
Victoria University of Wellington will be rallying tomorrow
to protest planned cuts to its Social Sciences Research
(SSR) programme.</p>

<p>Victoria University is proposing to
close its acclaimed Social Sciences Research programme and
make its two full time academic staff redundant. The
university claims the programme is no longer financially
viable, but staff are challenging that assessment.</p>

<p>The Social Science Research programme was established in
1987 to provide graduates with a high level of expertise in
multi disciplinary applied social science research and to
utilise the university’s strategic position in the capital
city.</p>

<p>There are now over 100 graduates holding the
MA (Applied) in Social Science Research all of whom have
worked closely with government agencies and community or
voluntary organisations during their study.<p>

<p>Tertiary Education Union organiser, Michael Gilchrist,
says that SSR graduates are much in demand, especially among
community organisations and government departments here in
Wellington. “They have the leadership and critical
thinking skills that epitomise the ideals Victoria
University has for its graduates.”<p>

<p>“While the
university is facing some real budgetary constraints, we
don’t believe that the financial position of the programme
has been carefully analysed nor its real value considered.
The potential savings are small – the strategic costs to
the university and the community are huge,” said Mr
Gilchrist.</p>

<p>The rally will take place at 12.30pm
Tuesday 25 August in the Hunter Courtyard (the Quad if wet)
at Kelburn campus.</p>
