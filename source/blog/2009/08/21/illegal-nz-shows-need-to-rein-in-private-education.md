         Media Release<br>21 August 2009</p><p>Illegal NZ shows need to
rein in private education</p><p>Last night’s episode of
Illegal NZ, where journalist Tony Wall exposes a
qualifications-for-cash scam at a New Zealand private
training institution, is a warning about the dangers of
for-profit education says TEU national secretary Sharn
Riggs. </p><p>“It’s disappointing but sadly not surprising
that there is at least one and probably more private
training institutes that are willing to sell qualifications
for cash, ” said Ms Riggs.</p><p>The New Zealand Diploma of
Business that we saw Mr Wall’s colleague ‘Danny’
purchase for $12,000 last night was NZQA approved and came
complete with an academic transcript.  </p><p>“It would not be
hard to work out from the details on the show which PTE or
PTEs Mr Wall had dealings with. We call on the minister to
investigate and close down any schools involved in this sort
of corruption immediately.  It undermines the high quality
reputation that all of New Zealand’s public education
institutions and many of its private training institutions
have built up over many years.”</p><p>“This is an extremely
serious issue, both for New Zealand’s international
standing and for the students who study or have studied
here. If the government is going to allow private companies
to use our education system to make a profit off students
then it needs to take more rigorous steps to make sure that
those students are given the same high quality education
that they could expect from our public education system,”
says Ms Riggs. </p><p>The TVNZ episode of Illegal NZ outlining
the cash for qualifications scam is available online at http://tvnz.co.nz/illegal-nz/s1-e7-video-2934088
