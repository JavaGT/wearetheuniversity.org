         Media Release<br>9 August 2009</p><p>Heavy-handed SIS spies
threaten academic freedom</p><p>“We cannot afford to have a
society where the SIS is spying on academics who are simply
doing their job,” says TEU president Dr Tom Ryan. 
</p><p>“News that a highly-respected University of Auckland
professor of law Jane Kelsey has been spied on by the SIS
because of her professional work is intimidating for all
academics. Our democracy will be weakened if tertiary
researchers and teachers are scared off from questioning
official policies in their own fields of expertise. But that
seems to be exactly the outcome the SIS was aiming for with
its long-running campaign against Dr Kelsey.”</p><p>“A
chilling aspect of Dr Kelsey’s case is that the SIS
appears to have been spying on her simply because of her
views on our country’s economic and trade policies rather
than any real concern that she might pose a physical or
military risk. And much of the spying appears to have
occurred in her university workplace.”  </p><p>“We’ll be
talking to other university stakeholders, especially
students and vice-chancellors, about our concerns. On the
basis of what we have read this morning, we believe New
Zealand needs a commission of inquiry into the SIS. Existing
legal protections for academic freedom clearly are
inadequate,” said Dr
Ryan.</p><p>ENDS
