         _<b>Media Release</b><br>3 August
2009<br><b>ACE is a vital link in our education
chain</b></p><p>Tertiary Education Union national secretary
Sharn Riggs is offering her support to those who will be
rallying this week to oppose cuts to adult and community
education.   </p><p>“Adult and community education has not
only seen its funding savagely cut, it has been marginalised
by the government as ‘hobby courses’ for personal
interest only.  The government’s attempt to define some
types of education as more worthy and valuable than other
types is a dangerous path to go down.  Not only does it risk
excluding the many people for whom traditional education
does not work, it also cuts the variety, colour and
enjoyment out of education.”</p><p>“Home mechanics or
Moroccan cookery might be the minister of education’s idea
of a hobby, but for many people the classes that teach these
skills are important links to people in their communities
and ideas in our culture and other cultures that they might
otherwise never meet.”  </p><p>“Education is a democratic
tool that exposes us to new ideas, new people and new
chances.  Deciding that some topics are not worth studying
or have no productive value undermines the democratic hope
that education gives us,” says Ms Riggs.</p><p>Sharn Riggs
will be joining the ACE staff and students from Wellington
High School and Onslow High School at on their march to
parliament tomorrow at
2.15pm.</p><p>Ends
