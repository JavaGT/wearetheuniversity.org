         Media Release</p><p>27 August 2009</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>State Services
Commission interfering in good faith bargaining<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The
State Services Commissioner is overstepping his role in the
tertiary education sector. Instead of carrying out his role
of being consulted, he is exercising a power of veto over
proposed tertiary education sector settlements that have
been negotiated in good faith, according to Tertiary
Education Union national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p><p>Ms Riggs
has written to the State Services Commissioner outlining her
concerns that the commission is acting beyond its statutory
powers as outlined in section 74 of the State Sector Act and
probably also falls foul of the good faith bargaining
requirements contained in the Employment Relations
Act.</p><p>“The TEU is engaged in bargaining at the moment in
all parts of the tertiary education sector: universities,
ITPs and wānanga. Our advocates are struggling to conclude
proposed settlements of collective agreements which have
been negotiated in good faith. The problems they are
encountering seem to be a direct result of the SSC’s
intervention in the collective bargaining
process.”</p><p>“Clearly, from our point of view, the
SSC’s unprecedented involvement in our negotiations needs
to stop. We seek an immediate undertaking from the SSC that
it will cease all involvement in our bargaining other than
that to which it is statutorily entitled,” said Ms
Riggs.</p><p>Ends</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;
