         MEDIA RELEASE<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautu
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>30 May 2009</p><p>Minister's Comments
Reveal Economic Vandalism</p><p>Minister of Education Anne
Tolley has shown not just a lack of empathy but a failure to
understand economics according to TEU national secretary
Sharn Riggs. </p><p>Yesterday (Friday), after Tairawhiti
polytechnic revealed it had lost about $2 million of its $16
million annual funding the minister told the Gisborne Herald
that regional polytechnics need to be able to stand on their
own two feet.</p><p>She is quoted as saying rural polytechnics
needed to be turned into "credible, viable
institutions".</p><p>"I absolutely believe in the role of
regional polytechnics but they have got to be able to stand
on their own two feet." said Mrs Tolley.</p><p>Sharn Riggs
says that attitude is economically illiterate. To say that
polytechnics can stand on their own two feet and become
credible viable institutions denies the fact that their
viability is entirely her responsibility not theirs. 
Polytechnics can't raise student fees or take in more
students to get more funding – The minister won't let them
enrol more students – and they don't have a base of
wealthy alumni.  They can only attain economic viability
from government funding.  If the minister vandalises that
funding it is unbelievable that she should then say it is up
to polytechnics to sort it out themselves.</p><p>"$2 million is
a huge amount of money for a polytechnic in a regional
community like Gisborne to lose. We are simply going to see
a return to the days where people in regional communities
are going to have much less access to high quality tertiary
education."</p><p>“This is shortsighted and disastrous for the
sector. Our members will see this as a clear sign that the
minister and this government actually couldn't care less
about regional New Zealand,” says Ms
Riggs.</p><p>ends<br>
