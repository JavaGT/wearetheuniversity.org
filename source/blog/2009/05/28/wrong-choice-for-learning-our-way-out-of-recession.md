<p><b> Wrong choice for learning our way out of
recession</b></p>

<p>“Cutting the funding supporting academic
salaries in universities will have major ramifications for
the future of research and learning in New Zealand” says
TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs. That money was
introduced to help New Zealand retain our best university
academics and staff as well as to compete internationally
for the best staff. Recently Australia responded to the
global recession by investing over AU$5 billion in tertiary
education and the United States has invested over US$30
billion. The decision to cut the tripartite funding combined
with other countries’ investment programmes in tertiary
education means that New Zealand universities may not be
able to address the pay disparities internationally. If we
don’t want our brightest academics and researchers here in
New Zealand then other countries will queue up for
them.”</p>

<p>“Bad as it is, our current economic situation
could have been the perfect context for addressing skill
gaps in our workforce and giving young people the
opportunities that a tertiary education can provide. The
recession has created a surge in student enrolments – the
money that the minister has promised is not enough to cover
those students.”</p>

<p>“We had understood that this
government was going to take the intelligent path to
tackling this recession but what we are seeing in this
budget is more cuts that will impact on the future viability
of the workforce of this country.”</p>

<p>“Cutting money from
so many important numeracy, literacy and skill enhancement
initiatives is also a poor decision. These kinds of projects
are an important way to link tertiary education to the very
people who most need a new chance in our struggling
economy,” concludes Ms
Riggs.</p>
