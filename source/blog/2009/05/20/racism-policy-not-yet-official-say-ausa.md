<p><b>Media Release – 20 May 2009 – For Immediate
Use</b></p>

<p><b>Racism Policy not yet official, say
AUSA</b></p>

<p>A motion passed at an Auckland University
students’ forum today, labelling National Party
by-election candidate Melissa Lee racist, is not yet
official AUSA policy, says Darcy Peacock, President of the
Auckland University Students’ Association.</p>

<p>While a
Student Forum labeled Ms. Lee racist, such meetings can only
recommend resolutions to the students’ association
executive for approval.<p>

<p>“Lively debate at Student
Forums is common, and the process to consider these motions
is robust,” said AUSA President Darcy Peacock. “Clearly,
many students were unhappy with the comments made by Lee and
came to the quad today to make their opinions heard”
Peacock added.<p>

<p>With speeches from Labour, National, ACT
and Greens, some students heckled Lee throughout the debate
and an election sign was captured by activists.<p>

<p>“Policies approved by the Student Forum are submitted
to the student executive for discussion and further
approval” said AUSA Administrative Vice President Joe
McCrory.<p>

<p>“While students led a very heated debate on
the statement made last week by Ms. Lee, the Association
executive has not yet considered the policy”, added
Peacock.<p>

<p>“AUSA will be seeking further input from
student groups before making an official statement on our
position” Peacock concluded.<p>
