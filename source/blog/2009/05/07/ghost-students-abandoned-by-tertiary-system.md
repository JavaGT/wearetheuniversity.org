<p>‘Ghost’ students abandoned
by tertiary system</p>

<p>“Tertiary institutions need to
take more responsibility for students who fail to turn up to
courses they have enrolled in”, said TEU president, Dr Tom
Ryan. He was responding to a Ministry of Education report,
released yesterday, which shows that New Zealand has one of
the lowest higher education qualification completion rates
in the OECD – significantly below Australia.</p>

<p>“Sadly, it’s a hangover form the old ‘bums on
seats’ funding model, where institutions set up courses
just to get students in the door, and then happily collected
both their money and the government subsidy.” But some
institutions now are unconcerned about those students who
never turn up to class. “Staff call these students
‘ghosts’ because they simply never see them. In some
first-year courses, ‘ghosts’ can comprise over 10% of
total enrolments”, said Dr Ryan.<p>

<p>“Often it is
only the course teachers and support staff who make an
effort to track down these missing students. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that some of them are not ready to pursue
tertiary study, and give up without knowing they should
cancel their enrolment. But also it appears that people are
enrolling in tertiary study simply to get access to student
loans. They seem unaware or unconcerned that such debt needs
to be repaid.”</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education report
attributes the high non-completion rate in New Zealand
tertiary institutions to the relatively large number of
part-time students, and to a significant number of students
changing their programmes of study part way through to
something different from what they had started.<p>

<p>“But this doesn’t paint the full picture,” argues
Dr Ryan.  “While those are important factors, the other
issue to consider is the financial imperatives on our
institutions to get students into courses, any courses. 
Students are missing out because they are not getting the
institutional advice and support when they take up study –
and when they disappear”.<p>
