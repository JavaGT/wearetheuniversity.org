<p>Media Release<br>18 June 2009</p>

<p>Māori tertiary students
need funding, not words </p>

<p>“Minister of Māori affairs, Dr
Pita Sharples is right to open up a debate about the low
rate of progression by Māori students into universities”,
says TEU president Tom Ryan. “There can be no doubt that
creative solutions have to be found to increase the levels
of access, participation, and completion rates of Māori in
higher education.”</p>

<p>But the minister also should reflect,
Dr Ryan proposed, on the fact that he is part of a
government that recently has reduced spending for the wider
tertiary education sector, which includes universities,
wānanga, institutes of technology and polytechnics, and
private training establishments.</p>

<p>“Currently enrolled
Māori students will be foremost amongst those hurt by these
cutbacks. The cuts also will reduce even further the number
of Māori students progressing on from the secondary
sector”, said Dr Ryan. </p>

<p>“Māori staff working in the
tertiary sector also are going to be negatively affected by
this recent budget, as institutions use it as a reason to
enforce restructurings and redundancies. Many kaupapa Māori
and other Māori-focused programmes have been put under
pressure in recent years, and we are concerned that now this
will get worse.”</p>

<p>Ryan said that the whole sector needs
to work collaboratively, along with government and Māori
leaders and communities, to make it possible for a greater
number of young Māori to engage in, and succeed in, higher
education. “Institutions should take care to prioritise
Māori programmes and the needs of Māori students and
staff.”</p>

<p>“At the end of the day, however, the crucial
issue is funding. Māori and other under-represented groups
can be given the chance to avoid unemployment and under
achievement by government investment in our tertiary
education system.”
