<p>Media Release – 9 October 2009 – For Immediate
Use<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students call for University to allow human
rights speaker on campus<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Auckland University student
leaders are dismayed today at the University of Auckland’s
decision to stop human rights activist Rebiya Kadeer from
holding a public meeting on campus next week, and are
calling on the University of Auckland to uphold its role as
the ‘critic and conscience of society.</p>

<p>Uighur human
rights activist Rebiya Kadeer has been issued a visa to
visit New Zealand and was invited to speak at the University
by AUSA affiliated club Greens on Campus, but has been told
that she will not be welcome at the University of Auckland
due to ‘security concerns’.</p>

<p>“Universities have a
clear role in New Zealand to act as the ‘critic and
conscience of society’, and comes at certain costs. It is
absolutely disgraceful that the University of Auckland is
unwilling to provide the necessary security to support Ms
Kadeer,” said Darcy Peacock, President of the Auckland
University Students’ Association. “The University and
the Students’ Association have hosted many controversial
speakers over their long history, and the fact that some
people might disagree with a speaker is no excuse to prevent
them from visiting our campus”.</p>

<p>“The sorry state of
tertiary education funding in New Zealand means that the
University relies heavily on the export education market in
countries such as China, due to underfunding by central
Government. It is a shame that the reliance on these
international markets comes with a cost to freedom of
speech” said Peacock.</p>

<p>“AUSA calls on the University of
Auckland to retract this decision and allow Rebiya Kadeer to
speak at the University,” concluded
Peacock.</p>
