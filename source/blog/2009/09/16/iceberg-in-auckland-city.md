<p>Media Release – 16 September 2009 – For Immediate
Use</p>

<p>Iceberg in Auckland City</p>

<p>The Auckland University
Students Association (AUSA) is today creating an urban
iceberg within the Auckland University Quad, as part of the
Greenpeace New Zealand Sign On campaign. Sponsorship has
been provided by Phoenix Organics, who have provided drinks
and other prizes for thirsty students. Greenpeace activists
dressed as polar bears will be encouraging people to get
involved and think about the environment.</p>

<p>The Sign On
campaign encourages the Government and the Prime Minister
John Key to call for a 40 per cent by 2020 emission
reduction target.</p>

<p>AUSA President Darcy Peacock said,
“This is a really fun event, and a great way for students
to get in behind the Sign On campaign. There aren’t
icebergs in the Quad everyday.”</p>

<p>“While it is no
disaster for the AUSA iceberg to melt by the end of the day,
it will be a bigger disaster if the polar ice caps melt and
we don’t do
anything.”</p>
