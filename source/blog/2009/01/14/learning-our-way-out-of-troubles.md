<p><br>Media Release<br>14 January 2009</p>

<p>Learning our way
out of troubles<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“John Key and Bill English’s
first cabinet meeting of the year tomorrow needs to focus on
investing in the future rather than cutting corners,” says
Tertiary Education Union (TEU) national secretary, Sharn
Riggs.</p>

<p>Prime Minister John Key has said that his first
cabinet meeting of the year, to be held tomorrow morning,
will focus on New Zealand’s response to the global
economic crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The TEU believes it is important that
cabinet’s response is to invest in learning and research
to give New Zealand’s economy a chance to lift its way out
of the threat of a long-term global economic
crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Tertiary education has the capacity, if well
funded, to move people into new jobs and to move New
Zealand’s economy in newly sustainable directions.&nbsp; We
can choose, like other strong economies and communities, to
learn our way out of troubles that were not our own
making.&nbsp; But we need to overcome the current underfunding,
and we need to do it now while we still have
time.”</p>

<p>“The Prime Minister must resist the
pre-election temptation to cut public services, because
investing strategically in public research and education
will be one of his best tools for making sure that New
Zealand is well positioned to climb above global financial
troubles.”</p>
