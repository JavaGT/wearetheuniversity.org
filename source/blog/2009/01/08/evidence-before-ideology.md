<p>Media Release<br>8 January 2009</p>

<p>Evidence before
ideology</p>

<p>The Tertiary Education Union (TEU), whose members
include tertiary education academics, is concerned that the
government’s proposal to overhaul home detention and
parole laws is another sign it may be setting a bad
precedent by pushing through policies that appear to lack
the support of sound, research-based evidence.</p>

<p>All
governments will have different priorities and goals but it
is important that they take time to check the academic
research evidence before putting together policy,” said
Sharn Riggs, TEU national secretary.  “Obviously we
understand the government’s desire to hurry policy through
to meet promises it made to its voters.  But governments
need to be careful not to let ideology come before evidence
otherwise they will end up with bad law.”</p>

<p>“Academics
and researchers have a crucial role to play in policy
development and they should not be excluded from the process
because a government is in a hurry or the evidence does not
suit the ideology of the day. Academics and researchers
obviously have many varying political opinions but the
advice they provide is all based upon research.”<p>

<p>“There has been lots of research into the efficacy of
home detention and parole that can help the government with
its work.  It would be a shame if that were ignored in
favour of the style of rushed legislation we saw before
Christmas.  For instance it would be hard to find an
academic in the field of labour law on any side of the
political spectrum who would say that the 90 Day Probation
Law was a well thought out piece of legislation.”<p>
