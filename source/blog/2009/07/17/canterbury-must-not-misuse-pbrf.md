         Media Release<br>16 July 2009<br>Canterbury must not misuse
PBRF</p><p>News in today’s Education Review that University of
Canterbury is looking to fine colleges that do not have
enough research active staff is a further worrying sign that
universities are misusing PBRF information, says TEU deputy
secretary Nanette Cormack.</p><p>“PBRF scores were designed
and intended as tools for government funding allocation, not
for universities to use to punish individual colleges and
the staff within them.”</p><p>“Using PBRF data as a proxy
for internal management is an abdication by managers of
their responsibilities.”</p><p>“The reality is that it is
not realistic to expect that every college at the University
of Canterbury , or any other university, will get high PBRF
rankings. For instance new academics can take time to find
their feet as researchers, but colleges should not be
discouraged from employing bright new academics in case they
get hit with future years of $40,000 fines.”</p><p>“It’s
also unfair to expect recently merged or subsumed units,
such as the College of Education, without a history of
active research, to be turning out internationally
recognised research in a short space of time.”</p><p>“If the
university’s central focus becomes chasing research
dollars it needs to be very aware that it does not let its
other role, teaching, suffer. Academics need good
professional development opportunities and support to become
good researchers, not punishments for failing to live up to
overly ambitious targets,” concluded Ms Cormack.
