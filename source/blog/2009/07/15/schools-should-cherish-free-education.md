<p>Media Release<br>15 July 2009</p>

<p>Schools should cherish free
education</p>

<p>It is time public and integrated schools put an
end to the pretence around voluntary donations and committed
to the spirit as well as the legal requirement to provide
free education says TEU communications officer Stephen
Day.</p>

<p>“People working in tertiary education are all too
well aware of the compromises that are made to public
education by making students or their parents pay fees.  If
you believe that everyone has a right to education then you
have to value that right by making sure that you remove the
barrier of fees masquerading as voluntary
donations.”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see the Minister has told
Education Ministry officials to investigate the latest
controversy of Rathkeale College apparently demanding a
parent secure $13000 of donations against her home.
Hopefully the minister’s investigation goes wider than one
school.  Voluntary school donations of this type are like
rust that one day grows into school fees, and eventually
into a private education system that lets some students
climb to the top while others miss out.”  </p>

<p>“If school
boards don’t want their students or parents encumbered
with student loans, credit card debt and all the financial
problems that plague many tertiary students they should take
a stance against these pseudo-voluntary donations
now.”</p>

<p>“Schools should cherish free education while
they can because it doesn’t last once you turn 19,”
concluded
Day.</p>
