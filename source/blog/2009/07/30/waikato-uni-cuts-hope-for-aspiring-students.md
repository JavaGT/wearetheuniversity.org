         Media Release</p><p>29 June 2009</p><p>Waikato Uni cuts hope for
aspiring students<br>&nbsp;<br>Following pressure from the
Tertiary Education Commission, the University of Waikato is
considering disestablishing its pioneering Te Timatanga Hou
and Certificate of University Preparation programmes.&nbsp;These
programmes have over the years have helped many first-time
students into tertiary study. Students and staff in the
Certificate of Attainment in Foundation Studies also face an
uncertain future.</p><p>In a letter to staff at the
university’s Pathways College, which oversees its
continuing education and foundation studies programmes, the
courses, the university’s deputy vice chancellor, Doug
Sutton, says that while no decisions have yet been made,
“…the proposal or any revised version of it … is
likely to result in the disestablishment of some positions
at CUP and Te Timatanga Hou; some reduction in CAFS staffing
levels may also be necessary.”</p><p>Even more ominously, he
warned that the university is proposing “a significant and
possibly total reduction in the number of pre-degree EFTS
for 2010.”</p><p>The university has told staff that high
numbers of degree-level enrolments are soon likely to exceed
its student funding cap by as much as 7 percent by the end
of this year. It must therefore take measures to avoid
carrying too many un-funded students. Also, TEC has urged
universities through the Tertiary Education Strategy and the
Statement of Tertiary Education Priorities to focus on
degree-level and postgraduate teaching. This direction,
combined with an increase in enrolments, has led to
entry-level courses and foundation studies programmes that
help students move on to degree study being cut.&nbsp;

<p>TEU
president Dr Tom Ryan says this means that at the University
of Waikato up to 450 students could miss out on admission to
the university next year, of whom about 40 percent would
identify as Maori. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“So the very people we
desperately want to have a chance at higher education, to
have better opportunities to provide for their families and
whanau, and to up-skill our communities and economy, are
going to be excluded by such a decision. The university and
the commission both need to reconsider the path they are
taking.”</p><p>Staff have been given until 5 August to respond
to the university’s
proposal.</p><p>Ends</p><p><br>&nbsp;<!-- LINKS REMOVED
