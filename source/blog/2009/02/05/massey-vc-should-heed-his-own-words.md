<p><br>Media Release<br>5 February 2009</p>

<p>Massey VC calls
to keep jobs as his own staff face possible
redundancy</p>

<p>Just as a review of Massey Wellington campus
support staff has concluded with at least fourteen staff
being given individual notice that unless they are
successful in obtaining a position via redeployment they
will be redundant in May the university’s vice chancellor,
Steve Maharey has given a speech challenging the government
to keep people in jobs.</p>

<p>The fourteen Massey staff affected
are all TEU members, but the union understands that there
may be other non-union staff who have also received
notice.</p>

<p>The announcement came at the same time as a speech
Massey University’s vice chancellor, Steve Maharey gave
yesterday, also on the Wellington campus, where he stated in
relation to the recession that keeping people in jobs is
probably the best social policy available:</p>

<p>“Investing
heavily in educational infrastructure, for example, will
keep people in jobs and improve our education system.
Keeping people in jobs is probably the best social policy
available.”</p>

<p>New positions have also been created as part
of the review, and affected staff will have the chance to
seek redeployment to these positions. Massey however intends
to advertise all the new positions and affected staff
seeking redeployment will be required to compete with any
other applicants for these positions.</p>

<p>TEU national
secretary, Sharn Riggs, says that the vice chancellor should
heed his own words and make sure that Massey’s process
gives weight during its redeployment process to those
workers’ experience, institutional knowledge and proven
commitment to the university.</p>

<p>“Our members who have been
given notice have demonstrated loyalty, commitment and
service to the university and are confident that if they are
redeployed, they can perform effectively in the new
positions created. They and the TEU also question why they
should have to apply for jobs which are essentially their
own.”</p>
