<p>Media Release<br>23 March 2009</p>

<p>The cost of everything and
the value of nothing</p>

<p>“It’s appalling to see that the
government‘s proposal to allow companies to swap holidays
for cash is back on the table,” says Tertiary Education
Union national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>“Annual leave is
an important chance for workers to spend time with their
family, their friends and their community. Schools,
community groups, churches and families all rely on holidays
to allow them to spend time with the workers in their
lives.”  </p>

<p>“A law that allows companies to encourage
workers to sell holidays for cash would tell workers that we
know the cost of everything and the value of nothing,”
says Ms Riggs. “Four weeks annual leave is not excessive
for a worker who wants to spend time with friends and
family, volunteer at a local sports tournament or visit
relatives elsewhere in the country. We all benefit from the
stronger society that develops when workers have time to
spend with their friends, families and
communities.”</p>

<p>“Sadly some companies will misuse this
law to trade holidays for cash if it is introduced, and
those workers with the least financial ability to resist
will be hurt the most.”  </p>
