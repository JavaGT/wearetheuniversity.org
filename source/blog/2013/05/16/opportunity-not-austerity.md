<p><br>Opportunity not austerity</p>

<p>Long term
under-funding of tertiary education since 2009 is taking
away opportunities to learn from students and future
students, say TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs, upon
hearing news that the tertiary education budget will
stagnate more than $400 million below than 2009 funding
levels.<br>As one example of these cuts, despite estimating
that student numbers will remain relatively steady, the
government plans to cut student allowances by nearly a fifth
over the next five years. It is cutting $400 million out of
student allowances payments over the next five
years.</p>

<p>“This government is stripping money away from
students, both directly through their loans, allowances, and
higher fees, and indirectly by attacking the quality of
their education,” says Sharn Riggs.</p>

<p>"Instead it is
subsidising $29 million to private education companies to
help them make a profit rather than investing in local
communities' public education institutions."</p>

<p>“This is
yet another in a series of nasty budgets, which chooses
austerity over
opportunity.”</p>
