<p><b>Open Letter to the University Of Auckland
Councillors</b></p>

<p>Dear Council Members,</p>

<p>In 1989 tertiary
education ceased to be free. What started out as $125 per
year is now around $7,000. You, as council members, have
decided time and time again to raise fees by the statutory
maximum of 4%. NZ's fees are the 7th highest in the OECD and
total student debt has skyrocketed past alarming $13 billion
mark. Students are suffering under the weight of this debt.
35% of students are changing their eating habits because of
insufficient funds, 40% are constantly worrying about money,
11.5% are struggling to make ends meet and 10% are unable to
manage on a day to day basis without borrowing money. This
is not an adequate foundation for the future of this
country. If fees continue to rise, our future will be
defined by greater financial woes, a culture of debt and
lack of meaningful education.</p>

<p>Student loans, or any form
of paid tertiary education forces students to treat
education like an investment. This is problematic because it
means only degrees with a high 'return' are prioritised. We
need more than just engineers and large animal scientists.
Universities are supposed to be the critical conscience of
society; a university run on a profit model will never be
able to fulfill this role. Privatisation of the cost of
education contradicts the socialisation of its
benefits.</p>

<p>The situation for postgraduate students is worst
of all. They are seeing their student allowances cut and can
look forward to harsher penalties in the event they can't
pay back their loan on time. Increasing debt places an undue
burden on students, arguably some of the weakest members of
society, yet those that hold the most potential within it.
Students typically have little to no income, devoting all
that we can to our futures and the future of our country. It
is short-sighted and frankly disrespectful to target such a
group simply because of our relatively weak position,
especially when our main intention is to improve society.
Students should no longer be the victims of draconian
austerity measures.<p>
<p>You, as council members, have the
opportunity to relieve this pressure for students. We urge
you, as a whole, to cut back on unnecessary capital
expenditure and oppose any increase of fees on students
without cutting staff or pay. Fight with the government over
its funding policies and allocate existing funds more
responsibly. There are plenty of countries around the world
who operate with free education systems and there is no
reason why New Zealand cannot be one of them.</p>

<p>Yours
always,</p>
