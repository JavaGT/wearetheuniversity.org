	 <p>
         18 October 2013</p><p></p><p>ALL COUNCIL MEMBERS<br>University of
Auckland<br>Private Bag 92019<br>Auckland 1142</p><p>Dear
AUCKLAND COUNCIL MEMBERS,</p><p>I write to you as the President
of the largest students’ association in New Zealand, the
Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA). I
represent not just their interests, but the interests of
every student pursuing and hoping to pursue tertiary
education.</p><p>The purpose of this letter is to encourage you
to seriously evaluate and debate your position on whether
another maximum fee rise for 2014 is good decision making,
to urge you to consider ALL of the information set out below
and above all to encourage you to ensure that the relentless
rise in fees is brought to a halt. </p><p><strong> <i>Fee
Setting</i></strong></p><p> Fee setting is an annual process
where all members of Council need to seriously consider the
broader implications created by another increase in fees.
AUSA urges you to consider the implications another fee rise
will have for domestic and international students studying
in 2014. Education should be available based on someone’s
ability to learn, not their ability to pay. Therefore
Members of Council should take a strong, principled stand
against increasing the financial burden already heaped onto
students.</p><p>Students are the only sector in society expected
to borrow money to live. This means they carry a tax-like
debt burden around their necks from the outset of their
lives. Accordingly only one in eight students are graduating
debt free, the amount of money students owe has become so
unrealistic that it is now incomprehensible that they would
have to pay back what for many resembles a mortgage sized
loan.

<p>This government has been following a policy of
selectively reducing the amount of money invested into
tertiary education. While universities are struggling to
keep their heads above water in a dynamic global
environment, government funding is stalling. Instead, they
are being licensed to squeeze more and more money out of
students. If New Zealand wants to continue to be a world
leader in education, government has to come to the party.
Subsequently it isn’t sustainable to keep putting the cost
of tertiary education onto the already think pockets of
students.</p><p>The current policy structure automatically
licenses the University to increase fees (this is a
dangerous admission). Hence Council members have a fiduciary
duty to the University and see maximising income to
subsidise operating expenses. In 2006, the Professor Stuart
McCutcheon said “Once again, we are left with a revenue
shortfall we will have to make up through a combination of
budget cuts and additional income from other sources.”-
“other sources” presumably including squeezing more from
students. Indeed without a commitment from the Minister of
Tertiary Education to invest the right amounts of funding
into education there will continue to be a shortfall in
funding.  It might seem that increasing student fees should
not be the default option.</p><p>AUSA challenges this premise
and calls on Council members to demand alternatives to
raising fees.  </p><p>The high level of tuition fees, lack of
student support, and the need to borrow to live means that a
large number of students have little choice but to utilise
the Studylink Scheme to borrow money to pay for their
education.</p><p></p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>Year</td><td><strong>Percent

some years, increases in student fees have compensated for
the Government’s failure to increase funding annually at a
rate proportional to inflation, let alone university costs.
Recently, this has forced the most financially vulnerable
participants in the tertiary system (the students) to make
up the difference. Students are left in an unfortunate
situation in which they have no choice but to pay increased
costs every year. We understand that the University must
seek alternative sources of income in the absence of
sufficient Government funding. However, we believe it to be
inappropriate that students continue to bear the burden of
that inadequate Government funding. </p><p>For the vast majority
of students, the only way to fund their studies is via the
student loan system, which is used to pay both fees and
living costs. For these students, increases in fees are not
measured by an extra amount per week broken up over the cost
of a year, but only by the total amount presented on a
student loan balance.</p><p>Despite this worsening situation,
higher fees are demanded every year from students. Over the
last four years the cumulative rise in tuition fees at the
University of Auckland equates to 21.6 percent increase.
University students are paying more but getting less.</p><p>The
average fee increase for domestic undergraduate and
postgraduate fees is represented on the table to the right:
</p><p> <strong><i>A Desperate Financial
Situation</i></strong></p><p>The Graduate Longitudinal Study,
funded by Universities New Zealand, revealed last year that
as many as 1 in 6 final year students were living in
absolute financial distress: unable to afford basic
accommodation, food and housing.</p><p>Evidence from the
increasing demand for emergency hardship and welfare grants
both within AUSA around the country has revealed that New
Zealand tertiary students’ finances are at a crisis point.
A survey, conducted by NZUSA of 17 students’ organisations
highlight the stresses that students are under as they bear
the brunt of recent government cutbacks to tertiary
education. Thousands of tertiary students are finding that
they don’t have anywhere else to turn. Since 2008 the
demand for food parcels has increase 124 percent showing the
increased demand for basic necessities. To respond to the
increased changes we have expanded the service to provide
family sized welfare packs for those with dependents as
often the basics isn’t enough to get a family through for
more than two days.</p><p><strong><i>Depreciating Support for
Course Related Costs</i></strong></p><p>The $1000 for
course-related costs that a student can borrow is unchanged
from 1992. Inflation has depreciated that $1000 so that it
is now worth just $624.66, or, to put it another way, goods
that cost $1000 in 1992 would now, according to the Reserve
Bank, cost $1,600.87</p><p><strong><i>Limited Access to
Allowances</i></strong></p><p>Only one-third of full-time, full
year, New Zealand students currently have access to
allowances. The maximum entitlement per week for a student
(aged under 24, without children, and living away from home)
is $171.84. Those ineligible, or who get a partial
allowance, can borrow through the Student Loans Scheme up to
$173.56 per week. Those on the full allowance can borrow the
$1.71 difference.</p><p>These amounts are derisory, given rent
per week alone is often more than these amounts. Further,
the fact that some students cannot survive suggests that,
for many students, the assumption that their parents can and
will support them is simply unfounded. In addition, since
2008 the government has cut eligibility to allowances
to:</p><p>•	Those studying courses of longer than 5 years
(previously eligible if the course was of national
significance</p><p>•	New permanent
residents.</p><p>•	Postgraduate students.</p><p>•	1800
additional students each year through the freezing of the
parental income
thresholds.</p><p><strong><i>Debt</i></strong></p><p>Average
graduating student loan debt is now $18,000, up from $15,500
in 2010. More than three-quarters of students used a loan to
pay for their fees, up 10 percent over the last five years
suggesting it has been harder for families to save for fees.
Presumably for similar reasons, the number of students with
a loan from their parents has been falling and is now below
15 percent.</p><p>Only 1 in 8 students expect to have no debt
when they graduate. Even while borrowing, students believed
that their student loan debt would impact on their ability
to buy a house (72% cited this), deciding when to go
overseas (69%), their ability to save for their future
(65%), and whether or when to have children (37% - up 10% in
the last decade).</p><p><strong><i>Housing
costs</i></strong></p><p>The median rent for a 3 bedroom home
increased by 5.7 percent last year (approximately $20 a week
increase). Auckland needs to build 13,000 new homes a year
to keep up with the growth of population. With only half of
that being provided a housing bubble is pushing up the cost
of housing. The demand for housing is so great students
cannot afford to be picky, they are willing to accept less
than acceptable standards of living to stay within their
budgets. The average rental price for one room in Auckland
Central is $262, far exceeding the maximum a student is
entitled to borrow through the student loan scheme. The
surrounding suburbs Mount Roskill and Balmoral had the most
aggressive rent increases in the last quarter making it even
more unaffordable as a student to live in a flatting
situation.</p><p>New Zealand is currently experiencing a
job-less recovery apart from in the construction industry in
Christchurch, and for many of Auckland’s graduates that
offers little salvation. If the returns through well-paid
employment are distant then imposing less debt on students
becomes even more important.</p><p>Of perhaps even more
short-term significance, jobs for students while studying
have been flat through 2013, slighter higher placements but
duration of work and amount earned are down. With around 75
percent of students working while studying this has a more
dramatic effect on their living situation even than access
to state support.</p><p><strong><i>Fees</i></strong></p><p>Despite
all the above, fees at New Zealand Universities have
increased at 4 percent each year since that became the
maximum, or 21.7 percent over the past five years. This has
run ahead of increased government contribution (16.5% and
flat in terms of per-student funding), and the budget of the
institution. Accordingly, students have been paying more for
less.</p><p><strong><i>International
Students</i></strong></p><p>Between 2012 and 2013 the Government
spent another $7.7 million on marketing campaigns to attract
international students. Regardless of this, earthquakes, a
global financial turndown and the good amounts of
investments in tertiary education in East Asia have deterred
international students from studying in New Zealand.
</p><p>Attracting more international students aligns with
Objective 13 of the University of Auckland Strategic Plan
2013-2020:</p><p>•         Objective 13: A growing and
increasingly diversified revenue base to support our
activities.</p><p>The Strategic Plan continues, “Paramount
among these is revenue from international education,
research and philanthropy.” But students are attracted to
institutions which have a vibrant campus culture, are ranked
highly in international rankings, and have a diverse
offering of support systems. At the University of Auckland
we have seen a high demand on the health centre, longer
waiting time before accessing critical counselling services,
reduced access to computers and study space, an over
subscription of people using recreation facilities, amidst a
paradigm shift of seeing education as a commodity, and one
of less and less value. </p><p>Being smart about the way we use
our money to ensuring quality measures are in place would
make the University of Auckland a more attractive
institution. </p><p>Since 2006 New Zealand’s leading
university has dropped 48 places in these world rankings.
There is a real risk of permanent reputational damage for
New Zealand. At the University of Auckland international
student fees effectively subsidise all other aspects of the
university. While the university has undertaken significant
efforts to attract more international students a drop in the
rankings puts that work, and the financial sustainability of
the institution, at risk. This is a story being repeated
throughout New Zealand.</p><p><strong><i>Postgraduate
Students</i></strong></p><p>This would also be aligned with the
University of Auckland Strategic Plan 2013-2020:</p><p>Objective
5: To establish a student body growing at 1% per annum with
increased proportions of international, postgraduate taught
and postgraduate research students </p><p>The Government
announced in 2012 that it intended to remove student
allowance eligibility for postgraduate study and study
programmes over 200 weeks.  </p><p>The justification for the
saving was to save $105,269,000 over the next four years.
This reduced support has increased the financial burden on
postgraduate students. Postgraduate Enrolment numbers for
2013 are down as students are struggling to afford to
continue with their studies directly due to financial costs.
</p><p> We strongly disagree with the assertion that price does
not have a significant impact on progression to postgraduate
study. The high cost of undergraduate tertiary study, and
the debt incurred at that level, is an immense disincentive
to continue enrolment in postgraduate
studies.</p><p><strong><i>Equity reasons</i></strong></p><p>An
increase in tuition fees always results in inequitable
outcomes for women, Māori and Pasifika students. This is
because they generally have longer repayment times. 
Moreover, Māori and Pasifika graduates will on average earn
less than Pākehā and/or male graduates.</p><p>Students who
graduated in 2000 had on average paid off 21 percent of
their loans five years after graduation. For Pasifika
students however this was only 4 percent of their loans,
despite their average loan being lower than European
students.</p><p>Higher fees will increase the already long
repayment times for these students. A number of Māori and
Pasifika students are also forced to study at certificate
and diploma level because of the cost for three-year degree
programmes. These choices results in lower paying career
options but with significant levels of debt. Students who
wish to staircase into higher qualifications like
bachelor’s degrees end up with large amounts of
debt.</p><p>Such barriers will have detrimental effects on
society and the economy as they will not see a diversity of
students entering a wide range of careers, and we will not
create a workforce representative of New Zealand
society.</p><p>Not only is this inequitable for the students
concerned, but we should be concerned about the gaps,
quality and appropriateness of services and industries as a
result of narrow student demographics in particular
areas.</p><p><strong><i>Fee increases are inconsistent with the
Tertiary Education Strategy 2010 - 2015</i></strong></p><p>Fee
increases are inconsistent with the Tertiary Education
Strategy 2010-2015. The strategy seeks to, among other
things: create a knowledge-based society; ensure maximum
educational opportunity for all New Zealanders; strengthen
Maori and Pasifika development; and strengthen connections
between tertiary education and the communities we
serve.</p><p><strong><i>Fee increases are inconsistent with
parts of the Education Act.</i></strong></p><p> Section 181 of
the Education Act 1989 clearly outlines the duties of
Councils in public tertiary education institutions. </p><p>Under
this section of the Act, there is a strong argument to be
made that relentless and exorbitant tuition fee increases
will have a negative impact on current and potential
students and work against the roles of Council:</p><p>(c)To
encourage the greatest possible participation by the
communities served by the institution so as to maximise the
educational potential of all members of those communities
with particular emphasis on those groups in those
communities that are under-represented among the students of
the institution</p><p>(f) To ensure that proper standards of
integrity, conduct, and concern for:</p><p>(i) The public
interest; and</p><p>(ii) The wellbeing of students attending the
institution are maintained.</p><p> Fee increases impact on (c)
as any increases will directly impact on the participation
and opportunities in tertiary education for many students
and will have the opposite effect of maximising educational
accessibility for all members of the community. </p><p>Higher
public education must not be limited because of a
student’s inability to pay or aversion to debt.</p><p>Fee
increases also impact on part (f). It is difficult to
understand how the increase in fees shows concern for the
public interest and students. The impact of fee increases is
detrimental and is an extra burden upon students and their
families.</p><p>While public tertiary education institutions
certainly have a case for receiving additional revenue, it
is unfair and ill-considered to simply lumber the cost onto
students.</p><p>It is vitally important that members of council
adhere to the duties entrusted to them under Section
181.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION </strong></p><p> Vice Chancellors and
Council members have often said that they are mindful of
student debt while raising fees.</p><p> However, any decision to
increase fees is directly voting for more student debt,
increased impacts on the life choices of borrowers, negative
impacts on our society and longer repayment times for all
students, particularly women, Māori and Pasifika
borrowers.</p><p> As a Council, you have the power to prevent
thousands of dollars more in student debt from burdening the
lives of our students and graduates.</p><p> To not raise fees
– and most definitely not by an automatic default of 4% -
would be a tremendous gesture of good faith on the part of
the University Council towards the students of this
institution. It would be an acknowledgment of the financial
difficulties faced by students, and of the significant
amount of debt that many are forced to take on in pursuit of
an Auckland degree.</p><p>Most significantly, this is an
opportunity for the Council to send a clear message to the
Government that its failure to adequately provide for rising
costs is unacceptable.</p><p>I do not believe it is the role of
students to compensate for inadequate Government
funding.</p><p>There is a wide consensus of opinion that the
Government needs to commit to a significant injection of
funding towards the public tertiary education system. In
order for this to happen, however, students, staff and
institution management will need to work together
collectively.</p><p>In the interim, and until our collective
goal is achieved, we do not believe that students should
shoulder the burden of under-funding in the sector and be
forced to pay increasing tuition fees.</p><p>Yours sincerely,
</p><p><br>Daniel Haines<br><strong>AUSA President
