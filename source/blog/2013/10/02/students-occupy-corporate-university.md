<p><strong>Press release - [3:15pm 02/09/2013] - For Immediate
Use</strong><br><strong>Students Occupy Corporate
University</strong></p>

<p>50 students are currently occupying
the Campus Life offices at the University of Auckland in
protest of the increased corporatisation and privatisation
of university life.</p>

<p>This occupation erupted after a rally
put on by the Tertiary Education Union and the Auckland
University Students Association to discuss the
corporatisation of the University and the need for a living
wage on campus, academic freedom and eradicating student
debt.</p>

<p>Students are concerned that the government views
tertiary education as an export commodity and as a luxury
for the children of the rich, rather than as a vital part of
a functioning society and that this short-sighted approach
is selling out New Zealand’s future.</p>

<p>Students hope that
this action will create a space for discussion surrounding
the way that tertiary education is funded and run in New
Zealand.<p>

<p>Spokesperson Mikaela Hunt said “life on campus
is increasingly being corporatised as the University shifts
its focus to extracting profit rather than providing quality
education and acting as the critic and conscience of
society. ”</p>

<p>Campus Life receives the Student Levy which
previously was given to AUSA to support students. Students
pay over $12 million for Campus Life’s minimal staff 
while service workers at the University are paid minimum
wage and students are crippled with debt.<p>

<p>Campus Life is
one of multiple corporate satellites which surround the
University of Auckland aiming to extract further funds from
students and to use students to generate profit. This is
part of a systemic corporatisation of the
University.</p>

<p>Stuart McCutcheon receives $660,000 a year
while service workers are paid minimum wage, all workers on
campus deserve a living wage.</p>

<p>Students warn University
management  that they will not be silenced by their
bureaucratic tactics and the crippling amount of debt that
they increase each year.<p>

<p>Students will continue to occupy
until student voices are
heard.</p>
