         <br>Minister announces changes to University Councils with
the next Tertiary 	Education Strategy (TES)</p><p>Stephen Joyce
took the opportunity this morning at Victoria University of
Wellington 	where he released the draft Tertiary Education
Strategy for 2014-2019 to also 	announce the much-rumoured
proposals to alter the composition of university
	councils.</p><p>Tertiary Education Union national secretary,
Sharn Riggs said that while 	disappointing, the announcement
was no surprise. “The minister has been keen on 	turning
universities into businesses with no links to their
communities for some time 	now. His view is that increased
productivity and profitability in the ITP sector where
	similar changes were made two years ago, has nothing to do
with the efforts of staff 	and other stakeholders but is the
result of stripping out the representative 	structures 	on
the councils”. </p><p>The new TES sets the framework for the
coming five years and is open for 	consultation for six
weeks. Sharn Riggs says that the TES appears to focus solely
on 	the business and economic advantages of skills
acquisition and the economic 	benefits of a tertiary
education to the individual and the country. “The
Minister’s 	speech to tertiary education leaders this
morning mentioned the word ‘society’ just 	once.
Tertiary education has many benefits, not just the economic
ones and this has 	to be factored into any strategy if it is
to be
successful”.</p><p></p><p>ends
