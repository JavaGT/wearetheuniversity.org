         <b>Politicians, Staff, and Students United Against Fee
Increases</b></p><p>Only one-third of full-time, full year, New
Zealand students currently have access to allowances. The
maximum entitlement per week for a student, aged under 24,
without children, and living away from home, is
$171.84.</p><p>Auckland University Students’ Association
(AUSA) and the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) are calling on
this government, and successive governments, to seriously
increase tertiary education funding. In the short-term, they
are calling on the University of Auckland to freeze student
fees at the current level.</p><p>The Graduate Longitudinal
Study, funded by Universities New Zealand, revealed last
year that as many as 1 in 6 final year students were living
in absolute financial distress: unable to afford basic
accommodation, food and housing. Only 1 in 8 students expect
to have no debt when they graduate.</p><p><b>Politicians from
Labour, Green and New Zealand First stand united with
students.</b></p><p>“The root of the problem is the National
led government’s continuing under-funding of tertiary
education,” says Grant Robertson, Labour MP and Shadow
Leader of the House. Robertson continues, “Steven Joyce
has a stated goal of ‘dampening down demand’ for
tertiary education. That means taking away opportunities
from students through restricting access to allowances and
loans. Now he is trying to take away the voice of students
and staff from Councils. Labour is committed to working
alongside students, staff and institutions to oppose this
agenda, and to create a more accessible and affordable
system.”

<p>Tracey Martin, Tertiary Education Spokesperson
from New Zealand First said, “Over the past five years the
National led government has cauterized post-graduate
allowance, limited the accessibility of higher learning and
now we are expecting another blow from Steven Joyce. New
Zealand First has always held the view that supporting our
students is not just an individual citizen’s future but in
the future of New Zealand”.</p><p>Gareth Hughes, acting
spokesperson for Tertiary Education for the Green Party
said, Auckland University’s decision to lock students out
of today’s fee setting meeting is unfair, and cuts those
affected out of the decision making process. Joyce’s
governance changes would only worsen this, treating
University councils like corporate boards, instead of the
diverse and inclusive organisations they should be. Auckland
Uni’s expected 4% fee rise comes on top of 3 years of the
maximum fee rise, far outpacing inflation, all while
students are struggling on insufficient support. This is
only worsening student debt which is already at record
levels. The Green vision is of a tertiary education system
that is well resourced, vibrant, innovative and responsive
to the needs of students and the changing needs of our
society.”</p><p><b>Staff and Students Unite</b></p><p>Daniel
Haines, AUSA President says “Persistent underfunding of
tertiary education has meant the burden is transferred to
staff and students as increased fees and redundancies. This
government has a targeted policy of reducing the amount of
money invested into tertiary education. They have
consistently funded education below the operating costs
o<br>f the University.</p><p>“For some years, increases in
student fees have compensated for the Government’s failure
to increase funding annually at a rate proportional to
inflation, let alone university costs. Recently, this has
forced the most financially vulnerable participants in the
tertiary system, the students, to make up the
difference.</p><p>“These amounts are derisory,” continues
Haines, “given rent per week alone is often more than
these amounts.”</p><p>The graduating student loan debt now
average $18,000, up from $15500 in 2010. More than
three-quarters of students use a loan to pay for their fees,
up 10 percent over the last five years. Families are finding
it harder to save for fees.</p><p>“An increase in tuition fees
always results in inequitable outcomes for women, Māori and
Pasifika students,” says Hannah Williams, Auckland
University Pacific Island Students’ Association President.
“This is because they generally have longer repayment
times. Moreover, Māori and Pasifika graduates will on
average earn less than Pākehā and/or male
graduates.”</p><p>Fees at New Zealand Universities have
increased 4 percent each year, or 21.7 percent over the past
five years. This has run ahead of increased government
contribution (16.5% but flat in terms of per-student
funding), and the budget of the institution.</p><p>Mark Amsler,
TEU Co-President said, “We believe the University of
Auckland Council should listen hard to the voices of
students, families, community leaders and even Minister
Steven Joyce, who has cautioned university councils to think
carefully about the impact raising fees by the maximum (4%)
will have on students and families. Granted, it’s a bit
rich for the minister to caution university councils, as the
government proposes to reduce representation on university
councils and continues to underfund the important, necessary
costs of tertiary education in New Zealand. Instead,
Government has steadily shifted the rising costs for
tertiary education onto students and their families.
Something’s gotta give.”</p><p>“Students have been paying
more for less,” remarks Haines. “The Government needs to
step up, but this university also needs to take a principled
stance and freeze the fees now.”</p><p>The Auckland University
Students’’ Association wrote an open letter to the
University of Auckland Council earlier last week, it can be
