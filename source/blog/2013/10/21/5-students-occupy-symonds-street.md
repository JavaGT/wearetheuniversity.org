<p>50 Students Occupy Symonds Street</p>

<p><br>20 October
2013</p>

<p>At 4pm on Monday the 21st of October, 50 University
of Auckland Students occupied Symonds Street. The protest
has stalled traffic on one of Auckland's busiest roads and
police are now directing traffic.</p>

<p>Students are
frustrated by the University’s year after year lack of
consideration of student welfare by increasing fees
regardless of economic conditions. Student debt in New
Zealand has surpassed $13 billion and will continue to rise
because of underfunding by successive governments in
Wellington. NZ currently spends 23% less per student than
the OECD average. Students strongly oppose the need to look
for corporate funding because of this funding shortfall as
this compromises academic integrity.<br><p>

<p>Reclaim UoA
spokesperson Mikaela Hunt says, ‘Students are suffering
under the weight of their debt. Currently, students and
graduates are forced to repay their student loan at a level
of income well below the poverty line. New Zealand has the
harshest repayment rate in the world, with twelve cents from
every dollar taken from every pay cheque. This is grossly
unfair, as the current tertiary education minister, and
almost all other members of parliament, benefited from a
fully funded tertiary education system.’</p>

<p>The University
of Auckland’s decision to further indebt students is
completely avoidable. The Vice-Chancellor, Stuart
McCutcheon, is currently NZ’s highest paid public
official, earning $660,000 per year and has spent billions
on questionable capital investments in his tenure.</p>

<p>Mikaela
Hunt says, 'We are here to make it abundantly that students
oppose fee increases and a future which chains us and our
country to
debt.'<br>ends<br><p>
