<p><strong>Students Rally to F**k the Fees!</strong></p>

<p>PRESS
RELEASE: Reclaim UoA</p>

<p>20 October 2013</p>

<p>At 3pm on Monday
the 21st of October, University of Auckland students will
rally to oppose a 4% tuition fee rise. Students are
frustrated by the University’s year after year lack of
consideration of student welfare by increasing fees
regardless of economic conditions.</p>

<p>Student debt in New
Zealand has surpassed $13 billion and will continue to rise
because of underfunding by successive governments in
Wellington. NZ currently spends 23% less per student than
the OECD average. Students strongly oppose the need to look
for corporate funding because of this funding shortfall as
this compromises academic integrity.<p>

<p>Reclaim UoA
spokesperson Mikaela Hunt says, ‘Students are suffering
under the weight of their debt. Currently, students and
graduates are forced to repay their student loan at a level
of income well below the poverty line. New Zealand has the
harshest repayment rate in the world, with twelve cents from
every dollar taken from every pay cheque. This is grossly
unfair, as the current tertiary education minister, and
almost all other members of parliament, benefited from a
fully funded tertiary education system.’</p>

<p>The University
of Auckland’s decision to further indebt students is
unforgivable and completely avoidable. The Vice-Chancellor,
Stuart McCutcheon, is currently NZ’s highest paid public
official, earning $660,000 per year and has spent billions
on questionable capital investments in his tenure.</p>

<p>Reclaim
UoA encourages all members of the public who believe in the
societal benefit of tertiary education to join us in
protest. Together, we can reclaim the
university.</p>
