<p><br>Govt responsible for varsity ranking slide</p>

<p>The latest
QS World University Rankings show a continuing trend of New
Zealand universities sliding down the rankings
ladder.</p>

<p>“With more universities, and particularly more
East Asian universities, spending  large amounts of money to
increase their research, quality and reputation it is no
easy task for New Zealand universities to hold their place,
” says TEU vice-president Sandra Grey. “But that task is
made near impossible by a government that has cut hundreds
of millions of dollars out of tertiary education in the last
five years.”</p>

<p>A significant component of the criteria QS
uses to rank universities is their staff: student ratio. In
New Zealand staff: student ratios have risen from 17.5
students per academic in 2007 to 19 students per academic in
2012.</p>

<p>“We are moving in the wrong direction,” says
Sandra Grey. “New Zealand academics are highly regarded,
and are involved in world class research and teaching. But
falling government funding means they face larger lectures
and tutorials, more administrative workload that takes time
away from research and teaching, and stagnant
pay.”</p>
