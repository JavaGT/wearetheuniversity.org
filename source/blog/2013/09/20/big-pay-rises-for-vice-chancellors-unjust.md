         Tertiary Education Union<br>Media release<br>20 September
2013</p><p><strong>Big pay rises for vice-chancellors
unjust</strong></p><p>The University of Canterbury's
vice-chancellor, Rod Carr, received an increase in
remuneration of more than $40,000 between the years 2011-12
to 2012-13 according to information released by the State Services
Commission.</p><p>"The University of Canterbury is a
university that is struggling financially, its struggling to
recover from an earthquake, its losing students and sacking
staff," said TEU deputy secretary Nanette Cormack. "It's
hard to imagine how a vice-chancellor who is already paid
far more even than the Prime Minister could justify taking a
pay rise that equals an entire salary."</p><p>Other staff at the
university have not had a pay rise since January last year.
300 staff have lost their jobs since 2010.</p><p>The State
Services Commission reports that at least six of the
country's eight vice-chancellors received pay rises from
their councils, despite falling government funding for
tertiary education, and State Services Commission guidelines
that limit pay rises for most other public
employees.</p><p>"University councils need to change their focus
so they are investing those staff and students who most need
the money to feed their families and get by from day to day,
rather than a group of vice-chancellors who already average
more than $500,000 per year in remuneration," said Nanette
Cormack.</p><p>"It hard to come up with a sane justification for
why the richest public servant in New Zealand would be the
vice-chancellor of the University of Auckland, earning
$50,00 more than the head of
Treasury."</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
