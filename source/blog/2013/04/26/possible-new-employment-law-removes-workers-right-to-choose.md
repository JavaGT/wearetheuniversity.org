         26 April 2013</p><p><b>Possible new employment law removes
workers' right to choose</b></p><p>The government’s proposed
new Employment Relations Amendment bill will not only be bad
for workers but, in the case of tertiary education, it will
be bad for students, says TEU president Lesley
Francey.</p><p>“This bill, and particularly its provision to
remove an employer’s duty to conclude bargaining, aims to
drive people out of unions and into lower paying jobs with
lesser working conditions. For workers this will make it
harder to take home the pay they need to support their
families and to spend time with their families and
communities.”</p><p>“For students in tertiary education they
are going to meet staff who have higher workloads, worse pay
and precarious casual employment agreements - none of which
is good for those who should be expecting quality learning
conditions.”</p><p>Ms Francey says students trying to work and
pay their way through their studies are often themselves in
the precarious jobs that will be first hit and worst hit by
this low-wage legislation.</p><p>“This bill has nothing for
workers in it, nothing for the economy, and nothing for
communities.”</p><p>“For TEU members working in tertiary
education institutions these changes will remove our right
to choose. These changes could result in thousands of
workers going from collective agreements to individual
agreements against their will because their employer has
decided that negotiations are finished and the collective
agreement has expired. TEU members choose to belong to a
union and belong to a collective agreement. These law
changes will take away that right,” said Ms
Francey.</p><p>ENDS
