         <br>Media Release<br>Tertiary Education Union<br>17 April
2013</p><p><strong>Cost Of Education Races Ahead Of
Inflation</strong></p><p>Statistics New Zealand released its Consumer Price Index inflation
statistics today and revealed that the cost of tertiary
education rose four times as fast as CPI for other goods and
services. While CPI for the year to March rose 0.9 percent,
the cost of tertiary education rose 3.8 percent.</p><p>TEU
national president Lesley Francey says that growing cost of
tertiary education risks excluding students from the
opportunity to learn.</p><p>“Students need to borrow more and
take on more debt to learn, and for some that is simply not
viable.”</p><p>It is not just tertiary education where the
cost is becoming more prohibitive - early childhood
education (2.5 percent), primary and secondary (4.7 percent)
and other education (4.9 percent) are all also rising in
cost much faster than CPI.</p><p>“In every instance this is
because the government is choosing to treat public education
as a cost it needs to pay rather than an investment in New
Zealanders,” said Lesley Francey.</p><p>“We believe that all
people have a right as citizens to an education. Education
gives the power to change people’s lives, and the
opportunities a community needs to thrive. It improves
health, democracy, culture, and equality in our
communities.” </p><p>“So it’s not fair when hundreds of
thousands of our students and future students are burdened
with huge debts, or worse, miss the opportunity to learn
because of the threat of debts they cannot afford,” said
Lesley
Francey.</p><p>ENDS
