<p><strong>Students Give a Dollar a Week to Help Other
Students</strong></p>

<p>The Auckland University Students’
Association has launched a scheme to encourage students to
make donations from one dollar a week to help other students
in need. The programme is called ‘Students for Students -
Tauira mō ngā take tauira’, and all donations go
directly towards AUSA’s welfare services.</p>

<p>“Students
for Students is a great and simple way for every student at
the University of Auckland to help others. Students can
choose to make a nominal donation from one dollar to five
dollars a week. It goes a long way to funding our key
welfare services,” says Administrative Vice-President Cate
Bell, who founded the Students for Students programme.</p>

<p>The
Auckland University Students’ Association provides a range
of welfare services to University of Auckland students.
These include food parcels, hardship grants and textbook
scholarships.<p>

<p>A maximum of $200 dollars can be given for
each hardship grant application. For every four students who
donate just one dollar a week, one hardship grant will be
funded in its entirety.</p>

<p>“These students are in genuine
financial distress. We can and only ever award hardship
grants for unexpected and serious hardship. Even with the
best budgeting, things can still go wrong. It could happen
to anyone,” says Jessica Storey, the Welfare Officer of
AUSA.</p>

<p>“Often the students we help are students who are
studying while taking care of children, or students who have
faced unexpected medical costs or unemployment and who are
subsisting on the absolute bare minimum and struggling to
make ends meet.”<p>
<p>Delays in payments by Studylink
payments have been the reason for a sizeable number of
applications. AUSA Welfare has also seen a spike in the
demand of its services from postgraduate students this
year.</p>

<p>“Students for Students is a simple way for me to
support other students who are having a tough time,” says
Lucy Cowie, a second year Bachelor of Arts student.</p>

<p>The
programme has been well received so far. A wider promotional
campaign will be launched at the University of Auckland in
the coming week.</p>

<p>Donations from students and the general
public are much appreciated. Please visit this link to
