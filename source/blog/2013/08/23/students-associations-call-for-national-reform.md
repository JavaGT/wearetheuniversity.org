<p><strong>Students’ associations call for national
reform</strong></p>

<p>Today, the Presidents of the Auckland
University Students’ Association (AUSA), Otago University
Students’ Association (OUSA) and Victoria University of
Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) said that they
would investigate a series of reforms for discussion at the
NZUSA Congress on 8 November.</p>

<p>These reforms will
include:</p>

<p>•  A more inclusive governance structure that
involves all student associations<br>•  An increased focus
on core NZUSA business: loans, allowances and the impact of
Voluntary Student Membership<br>•  A credible role in
organizing relevant, national campaigns on issues that
matter to students.</p>

<p>The VUWSA President Rory McCourt said
he empathized with the concerns of students and student
representatives who have reservations that NZUSA had fallen
into a period of inactivity. McCourt said “these reforms
offer hope for the return of an effective national student
voice.”</p>

<p>The AUSA President Daniel Haines “welcomes the
need for internal review so that we always perform to best
practice, NZUSA needs to have clear direction from its
members so moving forward there are clear expectations of
needs.”<p>

<p>Otago University Students’ Association
President Francisco Hernandez said: “Now is not the time
to abandon a national student voice at a time when many
students are hurting due to government allowance
restrictions, increases in the cost of living and suffering
in cold damp flats.”</p>

<p>The Presidents called the recent
moves by the Waikato Students Union (WSU) President giving
notice to withdrawal from national body without consulting
Waikato students, a “rash and hasty decision”. The three
called for careful consideration of the issues facing NZUSA,
but appreciated that WSU had generated a discussion for
improving the organisation.</p>

<p>All the three student
associations will undertake a robust consultation process
with students and their executives, engaging their
memberships and other students’ associations nationwide
with the goal of achieving a positive way forward for a
strong national student voice in New
Zealand</p>

<p>ENDS<p>
