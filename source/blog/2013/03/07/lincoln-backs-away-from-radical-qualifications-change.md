<p><b>Lincoln backs away from radical
qualifications change</b></p>

<p>Lincoln University decided
yesterday that it would delete only two of its undergraduate
qualifications instead of the 13 it initially proposed a few
weeks ago. The university had been proposing to compress its
undergraduate qualifications down to just three
degrees.</p>

<p>However, after receiving very critical
submissions from TEU and individual staff members, the
university is now proposing a much more limited change that
will see 13 degrees available in 2014.</p>

<p>TEU’s national
president Lesley Francey welcomed the decision but said
staff at Lincoln still faced significant
uncertainty.</p>

<p>“The university’s feedback document shows
that it still needs to do a significant amount of work. We
are concerned about the deletion of degrees, significant
changes to majors and courses with fewer than 3 EFTS to be
deleted. In particular we are concerned that the Bachelor of
Software and IT degree will be discontinued. That degree
which combines specialist IT courses alongside other
disciplines is one employers particularly value.”</p>

<p>“It
is disappointing that the university will not have
substantial specialist IT in the majority of its degrees. 
Given the minister’s stated priority for science and IT
this is a surprise.”  </p>

<p>Lesley Francey says the
university’s change of position indicates the power of
people participating through their union, and individually,
in the submission process.</p>

<p>“Lincoln’s TEU branch
worked incredibly hard to write a comprehensive and
compelling submission on the qualifications reform, and they
can feel proud to see their comments from that submission
reflected throughout Lincoln’s feedback
document.”</p>
