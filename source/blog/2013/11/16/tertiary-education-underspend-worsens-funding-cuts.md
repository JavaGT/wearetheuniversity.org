<p><br>Tertiary education underspend worsens funding cuts</p>

<p>It
is a shame nearly $80 million that the Tertiary Education
Commission could have spent on teaching went unspent, says
TEU vice president James Houkāmau.</p>

<p>The commission tabled
its annual report to parliament on Tuesday, where it
revealed that it underspent its funding for teaching and
learning by $78 million, or 2.9 percent of its total budget.
That includes $17 million that was budgeted for student
achievement and $33 million that was budgeted for industry
training but not spent.</p>

<p>"$17 million is nearly one million
each for every polytechnic in New Zealand," says Houkāmau,
who works at Whitireia Polytechnic. "That money could have
stopped courses closing, kept high quality teaching staff in
jobs where they could help young New Zealanders get skills,
and helped New Zealand learn its way out of tough financial
times."</p>

<p>The annual report also shows the commission left
$3 million unspent in the impoverished adult and community
education sector.</p>

<p>"Ongoing government cuts to funding are
hard enough without the Tertiary Education Commission making
those cuts even deeper by doling out only part of the money
it sets aside to help students
learn."</p>
