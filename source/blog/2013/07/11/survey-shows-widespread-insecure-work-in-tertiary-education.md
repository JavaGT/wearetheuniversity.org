         <br>11 July 2013</p><p>Survey shows widespread insecure work in
tertiary education</p><p>A survey of nearly 2000 TEU members
shows insecure work, casual and fixed-term employment
agreements are widespread in tertiary education. One in six
respondents said they were currently in an insecure, casual
or fixed-term position, and a further one-third said they
had been in such a position in the past.</p><p>TEU national
president Lesley Francey, who undertook the survey, said
employees in casual or insecure work such as fixed-term
employment normally have fewer work rights. Eighty-seven
percent of those surveyed in insecure work want permanent
employment and the rights that come with it.</p><p>Lesley
Francey says that s66 of the Employment Relations Act is
clear that employers are only allowed to employ people in
fixed-term positions for specific reasons. She is doubtful
that employers are sticking to those reasons and is
concerned that all they are trying to do is save money
instead. Also, the misuse of casual employment positions
means that many employees are not able to move into
permanent positions.</p><p>The law makes it clear that there
needs to be a genuine reason for fixed-term jobs. Fixed term
jobs cannot be used to trial a person, to encourage a person
to undertake training or pursue higher qualifications, or to
limit someone’s legal employment rights (such as their
right to holidays or other leave).</p><p>More than one-third of
the survey respondents currently in non-permanent employment
said they have worked at their institution for over five
years.</p><p>That shows, says Lesley Francey, that many of them
are entrenched in insecure work.</p><p>“They are moving from
one fixed-term agreement to the next - often teaching the
same course or doing the same job year-in,
year-out.”</p><p>ends
