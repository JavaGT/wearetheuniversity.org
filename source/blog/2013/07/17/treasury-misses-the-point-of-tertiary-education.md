<p><strong>Treasury
misses the point of tertiary education</strong></p>

<p>Treasury's
bizarre working paper <i>Private Returns to Tertiary
Education</i>, which it released yesterday, seems to
argue that New Zealand should move from emulating equitable
and economically successful countries like Sweden, Norway or
Japan, to copy Portugal, Turkey and Hungary instead.</p>

<p>TEU
national president Lesley Francey says instead of measuring
the private benefits of tertiary education Treasury should
measure the public benefits.</p>

<p>The paper, one of 12 that
Treasury published yesterday, documents New Zealand's low
rate of private return for tertiary education - that is
people with a tertiary education earn more than people
without a tertiary education but that gap is not as large as
it is in most other OECD countries.</p>

<p>To prove its point
Treasury publishes a graph showing New Zealand at one end of
the spectrum with economically and socially successful
countries Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Japan. It then
proposes that New Zealand should abandon this end of the
graph and head to join a different set of countries at the
other end of the OECD - Poland, Hungary, Turkey, Portugal
and Slovenia.</p>

<p>"No
disrespect to any of those countries, but maybe more
equitable pay is putting us in good economic company," says
Lesley Francey.</p>

<p>"What Treasury's working paper actually
shows is that New Zealand has comparatively low wages and
salaries for all workers, including those with tertiary
qualifications. The paper does not once mention the public
benefits nations get from tertiary education. However, one
that has been well documented in the past is that tertiary
education helps create a more equal society where everyone
benefits, including those who do not
study."</p>
