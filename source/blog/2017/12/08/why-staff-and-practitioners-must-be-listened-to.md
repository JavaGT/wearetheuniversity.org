         Media release<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>Teacher training report evidence of
why staff and practitioners must be listened to</p><p>Today’s
Education Review Office (ERO) report showing a 'widespread' lack of
confidence in teacher graduates' preparedness for the
classroom is a reminder to government and institution bosses
that tertiary education staff must be listened to when
training courses are changed.</p><p>Expert staff and
practitioners warned the Ministry of Education, the Tertiary
Education Commission and colleges of education bosses that
relaxing entry levels and focusing on the pedagogy of
teacher education at the expense of practicum would result
in a deterioration of student skills.</p><p>Repeated warnings at
the time from members of the Association of Staff in
Tertiary Education and then the Tertiary Education Union
(TEU) fell on deaf ears. Unfortunately, as the ERO report
suggests, ignoring these concerns put the education of our
children at risk.</p><p>Sharn Riggs, secretary of the TEU said
“the ERO report confirmed what staff have been telling
government for years: if you relax standards and diminish
the practical component of teacher training, new graduate
teachers will be underprepared for the classroom, and that
ultimately it will be the education of our children that
suffers.”</p><p>The ERO report says it found “a lack of
confidence in the selection, professional education and
capabilities of many newly graduated teachers as they enter
the profession.” It also said that from 2000 to 2015, New
Zealand has witnessed a decline in performance “in the
critical areas of reading, mathematics and
science".

<p>Earlier this week a global study found that the average
reading level of Kiwi 10-year-olds has dropped to its lowest
level on record. New Zealand is currently ranked 32ndout of
50 countries in reading achievement, having dropped eleven
places since 2011.</p><p>The Education Council said it is
considering changes to make sure all future teachers enter
the workforce well equipped to teach in the classrooms. It
is vital that staff are given a leading role in this process
so that the mistakes of the past are not repeated, the TEU
said.</p><p>“The ERO report is a lesson to all decision
makers. When making changes to professional training
qualifications, the people who deliver the training
day-in-day-out must be listened to. They know the profession
better than anyone, and had their expertise been listened to
at the time then this disappointing report could have been
avoided,” Riggs said.</p><p></p><p>1.	A copy of the ERO report can
