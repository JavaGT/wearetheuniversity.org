<p>Thank You - Together, We Achieved So Much in 2017!</p>

<p><br>It
was because we stood together that we stopped the last
National Government passing legislation to further privatise
tertiary education, started a national debate about the
declining conditions of work in tertiary education and
helped create the conditions that mean we now have a
government committed to publicly funded and publicly
controlled tertiary education.</p>

<p>Together, we negotiated
collectively at institutions across the country for a Living
Wage and have worked hard to ensure the lowest paid workers
get the biggest boosts in pay. We have also stood together
for fair and secure work for more people working at our
institutions. The work staff do is too important for them to
have to constantly worry about their job ending because of
fixed-term appointments.</p>

<p>We called on the government to
better support the arts and humanities and put an end to
failed performance metrics, reversed decisions to outsource
essential services, challenged excessive workloads and
poorly planned redundancies, and supported hundreds of
members to ensure they get a fair deal at work.</p>

<p>There have
been challenges along the way, of course – but in every
department, every faculty and every institution we have
stood strong and used our collective voice to demand a
better future for all staff, students, and
communities.</p>

<p>Our successes were not just about ensuring
everyone has access to tertiary education that is public,
local and focusing on learning – but about negotiating
collectively for salaries and conditions that recognise the
time, energy and skill put in by the staff that make our
tertiary institutions great places to study.
</p>

<p>Next year is
about continuing this momentum and working together to make
sure our communities have access to quality learning
opportunities, changing the rules so staff and students have
a voice in workplace decisions and improving salaries and
conditions.</p>

<p>We know that the best results will be achieved
if senior leaders, staff, students and government officials
are able to work together, build sustained relationships and
find ways to deliver our shared priority of quality tertiary
education. Leading this work is an early priority for the
TEU next year, particularly as the government starts
developing its 30 year strategic plan for education.</p>

<p>As
part of this work, the TEU, jointly with the Manukau
Institute of Technology and the New Zealand Union of
Students’ Associations (NZUSA) will host a forum on the
future of vocational education and training. Education
Minister, Chris Hipkins, will address the forum. The forum
will be followed by a TEU and NZUSA hosted roundtable
discussion on the future of our universities. Both of these
important events will take place in early March, with full
details to be announced in the New Year.</p>

<p>In the meantime,
from everyone at the TEU national office, we hope you enjoy
a restful holiday with whānau and friends. We look forward
to working with you next year.</p>

<p><br>Freeze tertiary
bosses’ pay until all staff paid the Living Wage</p>

<p>The
Tertiary Education Union said today that the State Services
Commission should take steps to reduce the imbalance in pay
between Vice-Chancellors and Chief Executives and other
staff of tertiary education institutions.</p>

<p><br>Your favourite
stories of 2017</p>

<p>To close the year we thought we’d share
some of your favourite Tertiary Update stories and blogs
from 2017.</p>

<p>Massey University vice-chancellor, Jan Thomas,
caused dismay in October when she invited
more than 1,000 staff to express an interest in quitting
their jobs , raising fears that the institution could be
restructuring by stealth.</p>

<p>The move caused a great deal of
concern about the future of the Massey, a problem sadly
echoed by news that the University of Otago is to cut
160 jobs in a massive shake-up in the way support
services are delivered and that NorthTec management will cut courses and
close two campuses .</p>

<p>These cuts are just a snapshot of
the constant upheaval happening right across the
sector , an issue that put the policies of the previous
government under the spotlight in an article that criticised National for forcing the tertiary
education sector down the wrong track .</p>

<p>Even the then
Minister, Paul Goldsmith, admitted in a live
interview that his government’s reforms risked lowering
standards in the sector .</p>

<p>Goldsmith’s admission came
after staff at tertiary education institutions came forward
to share their experiences of how National’s perpetual
underfunding of the sector and failed reforms have put them
under increasing pressure to pass students and dedicate less
time to teaching.</p>

<p>Rather than feeling they could speak up
in their own workplaces about the pressures to amend grades,
or change how they deliver a course, staff used the
opportunity created by a TEU survey into staff wellbeing to
talk anonymously to broadcasters, or comment on media
websites - an issue the Minister chose to ignore .</p>

<p>The TEU has
called on the new government to urgently redirect the sector
following the welcome announcement that students will be
able to study for free next year . The reforms that
should be put in place were set out in a briefing published by the TEU immediately
after the new government formed .</p>

<p>These changes can
happen when we stand together , as was made
clear by the TEU’s successful campaign to stop
National’s attempt to change the law to funnel public
money to private tertiary
education.</p>
