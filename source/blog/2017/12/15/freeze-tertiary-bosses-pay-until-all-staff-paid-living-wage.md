         Freeze tertiary bosses’ pay until all staff paid the
Living Wage</p><p></p><p>The Tertiary Education Union (TEU) said
today that the State Services Commission (SSC) should take
steps to reduce the imbalance in pay between
Vice-Chancellors and Chief Executives and other staff of
tertiary education institutions (TEIs).</p><p>State Services
Commissioner Peter Hughes has called for the brakes to go on
chief executive pay across the State Sector following
publication of the Senior Pay Report 2017 earlier this
week. He said state sector chief executive salaries are too
high and that pay increases are not sustainable.</p><p>TEI
bosses’ pay could be frozen until all institution staff
are paid at least the Living Wage, the TEU suggested. To
help address the pay imbalance, the TEU has been negotiating
collectively at a number of institutions for a Living Wage
and have worked hard to ensure the lowest paid workers get
the biggest boosts in pay.</p><p>Commenting on the SSC’s
figures, national president of the TEU, Sandra Grey,
said:“The imbalance in pay between the highest and lowest
paid at our tertiary institutions is an issue that should
concern all New Zealanders. It is ridiculous that some
vice-chancellors and chief executives are earning more than
the Prime Minister, yet continue to refuse to pay their
lowest paid staff enough to provide for their
families.</p><p>“It was reassuring to hear the State Services
Commissioner say it was time to put the brakes on bosses’
pay. It would send an important message about how much New
Zealanders value the time, energy and skill put in by the
staff that make our tertiary institutions great places to
study, if chief executive and vice-chancellor pay is frozen
- at least until every staff member is paid the Living
Wage.”</p><p>--ENDS--</p><p><br>
