         Fees-free tertiary education great news for all
Kiwis</p><p><br>Every New Zealander will benefit from making
learning more accessible, the Tertiary Education Union said
today in response to the government’s announcement that
Kiwis who have recently left school, or who have done less
than half a fulltime year of post-school education or
training will be eligible to study fees-free next
year.</p><p>Sandra Grey, national president of the TEU, said:
“We all benefit when tertiary education institutions
educate students, carry out research and contribute to their
local community. Whether it’s the mechanic who gets our
car back on the road, the nurse that cares for our loved
ones in their time of need, or the teacher that inspires our
children to learn – the benefits of tertiary education are
all around us.</p><p>“Public tertiary education supports
economic and social development, with society and businesses
alike benefiting from well-educated people. It is only right
that we pool our resources to ensure these learning
opportunities are available to as many people as possible -
and that cost is not a barrier to study.</p><p>“Under
National, the private good model of tertiary education
sorted the tertiary educated from the non-tertiary educated
by willingness or ability to pay. From today, whether
you’re a young person figuring out your path, changing
careers later in life, learning new skills or finding your
passion, tertiary education will be a more realistic
option.”</p><p>--ENDS--
