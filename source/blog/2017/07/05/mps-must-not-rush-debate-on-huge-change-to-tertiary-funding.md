Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p><strong>MPs Must Not Rush Debate on
Huge Change to Tertiary Education
Funding</strong></p><p><strong>MPs must not rush debate on a
change of law that would give for-profit tertiary education
companies equal funding to universities, polytechnics and
wānanga, more than one-hundred students, academics, general
staff and union representatives have told Education and
Science Select Committee Chair, Jian Yang MP, in an open
letter published today to coincide with the Committee’s
latest hearing on the tertiary education Bill
[1].</strong></p><p>The new law would give Ministers greater
powers to divert public funds away from public tertiary
education providers and hand them to private companies
instead [2]. There are widespread fears this could reduce
access to tertiary education for future generations of
students. The open letter says MPs need to allow more time
for New Zealanders to learn about the proposed changes and
to participate in a discussion about what they mean for
public tertiary education.</p><p>The open letter was prompted by
concerns that National is trying to get the law passed
before the election. More than 2,000 people recently wrote
to the Select Committee telling MPs they reject the changes
and instead want a tertiary education sector that is public,
local and focused on teaching and learning [3]. Trying to
pass the law before the election would not allow for enough
time to consider this wide range of views, the letter
says.

<p>Sharn Riggs, national secretary of the Tertiary
Education Union (TEU), said: "<strong>National is rushing to
quietly push through a fundamental change to the way
tertiary education is funded before the general election.
The law is opposed by thousands of people and we are worried
that these views won’t be properly listened to. MPs need
to set aside more time so we can have a proper public debate
about what this legislation means for the millions of Kiwis
hoping to access tertiary education now and in the future.
</strong>”</p><p>Associate Professor Nicola Gaston, the
University of Auckland, said: <strong>“Increased
privatisation of our tertiary sector is a matter of huge
public interest, and many voices need to be given the
opportunity to be heard.”</strong></p><p>Professor Jane
Kelsey, the University of Auckland, said: <strong>“Giving
tax-payer subsidies to the for-profit private education
industry, while continuing to starve the public tertiary
sector of funds is part of a conscious strategy by the
National government to privatise the public universities and
polytechnics, on top of increasing political control of
their governance. Once in place, this law may be
irreversible under New Zealand’s trade in services
obligations. Even without that trap, universities that are
being so deliberately run down that a future government will
find it extremely difficult to re-establish their
international standing, intellectual capital, and public
good role.”</strong></p><p>Carla Jeffrey, Te Tumu Āwhina TEU
Te Toi Ahurangi said: <strong>“Transferring large sums of
public money away from public-funded, local institutions to
private for-profit providers could have a huge impact on
Māori access to and participation in tertiary education. We
are worried that the Select Committee is not allowing enough
time to look at what these implications for Māori might be.
I hope the Select Committee’s chair, Dr. Yang, will listen
to our concerns and allow more time for a public discussion
about how opening up tertiary education to private and
profit-driven providers will impact
Māori.”</strong></p><p>Dr. Siouxsie Wiles, the University of
Auckland, said: <strong>“What’s the old saying? Act in
haste, repent at leisure. This is an important decision that
will affect our children’s future. Let’s make sure the
Select Committee have time to hear all the evidence and make
the right decision.”</strong></p><p>Professor Jack Heinemann,
the University of Canterbury, said: <strong>“To redirect
already scarce public monies from public universities to
profit-driven private providers could in the long run mean
fewer options for students and less support at all degree
levels. The proposed changes should be seen for what they
are: a way to distract the public from government’s
unwillingness to fund education at the levels it should. MPs
need to allow more time to debate what this means for the
future of tertiary
education.”</strong></p><p><strong>--ENDS—</strong></p><p><strong>Notes
