<p>In 2015, there were 450,000 students
in provider-based study, and 160,000 in workplace-based
study. Thirty-five per cent of 18-24 year olds were in
provider-based study alone, plus a number from that age
group in workplace-based tertiary level education. This
suggests that the overall number of young people in tertiary
education is considerably more than 30%.</p>

<p>‘Morgan
seems to believe that only those at university are engaged
in tertiary-study. Yet he forgets that those in
polytechnics, wānanga, industry training, community
providers and apprenticeships are also engaged in tertiary
education.’</p>

<p>Gee calls on TOP engage with students and
young people in the development of future policy.</p>

<p>‘While
this policy is a start, it must acknowledge the rising
living costs faced by students and young people and also
speak to their lived experiences. For example, while
financial security is a significant factor in the mental
health crisis and suicide rate of young people, we know from
talking to them that there are also a range of other
significant factors, such as the trauma and stress they
carry with them, or that they are currently facing in other
parts of their lives.’</p>

<p>NZUSA is the national voice of
students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed
by students’ associations from universities and
polytechnics around the
country.</p>
