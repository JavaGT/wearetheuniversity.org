         TOP’s youth UBI policy a step in the right direction</p><p>The
New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has
welcomed a recent policy announcement by The Opportunities
Party (TOP) for a universal grant to young people aged
18-23.</p><p>NZUSA has long called for a universal student
allowance, noting the inefficiencies, unfairness and
invasiveness of means-tested allowances in recent decades,
and it has encouraged explorations into UBI in the
past.</p><p>‘In this important election year, politicians need
to speak to the lived realities of young people, and allow
for their issues to be brought up into the political
system’, says National President Jonathan
Gee.</p><p>‘Means-testing for student allowances has proven
invasive, inefficient and unreflective of the financial
independence of many young people. We welcome policies that
look toward universality, and TOP’s youth universal basic
income policy is a step in the right direction’, Gee
says.</p><p>Gee however disputes TOP’s inaccurate and
dismissive comments about tertiary education participation.
TOP leader Gareth Morgan stated that only 30% of young
people are in tertiary education, and that supporting
students in university is middle class welfare as most were
well-off.</p><p>‘We know that tertiary education is a powerful
social lever which takes many disadvantaged communities out
of poverty and reduces inequality. Dismissing it as a
middle-class aspiration ignores the public value of
education. We want education to be available for all those
currently locked out of tertiary study, not to reject their
dreams’, Gee said.

<p>In 2015, there were 450,000 students
in provider-based study, and 160,000 in workplace-based
study. Thirty-five per cent of 18-24 year olds were in
provider-based study alone, plus a number from that age
group in workplace-based tertiary level education. This
suggests that the overall number of young people in tertiary
education is considerably more than 30%.</p><p> </p><p>‘Morgan
seems to believe that only those at university are engaged
in tertiary-study. Yet he forgets that those in
polytechnics, wānanga, industry training, community
providers and apprenticeships are also engaged in tertiary
education.’</p><p>Gee calls on TOP engage with students and
young people in the development of future policy.</p><p>‘While
this policy is a start, it must acknowledge the rising
living costs faced by students and young people and also
speak to their lived experiences. For example, while
financial security is a significant factor in the mental
health crisis and suicide rate of young people, we know from
talking to them that there are also a range of other
significant factors, such as the trauma and stress they
carry with them, or that they are currently facing in other
parts of their lives.’</p><p>NZUSA is the national voice of
students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed
by students’ associations from universities and
polytechnics around the
country.</p><p>ENDS
