	 <p>
         Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o
Aotearoa</p><p></p><p>Labour’s Promise Puts Future of Public
Tertiary Education on the Ballot Paper</p><p>Labour’s promise
to ditch the National-led Government’s plans to change the
law so that public funds can be diverted to for-profit
education offers voters a real choice in this election about
the future of public tertiary education, the Tertiary
Education Union said today.</p><p>Announced this afternoon,
Labour’s commitment would help to ensure the provision of
tertiary education is determined by the needs of New
Zealanders, not the profit-making motives of big companies.
Labour, the Greens and New Zealand First are all opposed to
National’s damaging legislation, meaning voters have a
genuine chance this election to vote against the
commodification of learning and to keep tertiary education
public and local.</p><p>Sandra Grey, national president of the
Tertiary Education Union, said: “Labour’s commitment to
keeping tertiary education public offers a credible and
popular alternative to the clear failings of the current
National-led approach to increasingly privatising education
and making it business-focussed.</p><p>“National has spent the
last nine years pushing a profit model onto the learning
opportunities institutions deliver, and where they’re
based. As a result, funding has become increasingly
unstable, and changing student numbers has brought frequent
chaos to institutions and cuts to departments. Three more
years of National’s failed approach poses a serious threat
to education in rural and regional communities where
institutes of technology and polytechnics are already losing
out to for-profit providers.

<p>“Tertiary education belongs
to all of us, because it benefits all of us. It must be an
accessible public service that serves society. Winning
elections is about inspiring people to vote for a genuine
alternative, and with Labour, the Greens and New Zealand
First all opposing National’s tertiary education plan
there is an opportunity to vote for a change that will
benefit us
all.”</p><p>--ENDS--</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
