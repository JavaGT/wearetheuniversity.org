         <strong>Abolishing Student Allowances would deepen
inequality</strong></p><p>31 July 2017 - The New Zealand Union
of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is warning that any plan
to abolish Student Allowances would deepen inequality, in
response to the United Future party’s recent tertiary
education policy announcement.</p><p>‘We welcome policies
which aim to improve access to tertiary education for all,
such as the removal of tuition fees, but taking away living
allowances from low-income New Zealanders is not the
answer,’ says National President Jonathan Gee.</p><p>United
Future proposes to abolish tuition fees, and in turn abolish
Student Allowances to help pay for it. It also proposes to
increase the cap on student loan borrowing for living costs
with regional variation based on the average rent price in
that area.</p><p>Gee says ‘while students have told us that
their immediate concern is having enough to live on, their
long-term concern is graduating with less debt. Linking
student loan borrowing to the cost of living, while not
addressing the cost of living itself, risks lumping
graduates with spiralling and unmanageable debt.’</p><p>‘We
also know that many low-income families are extremely averse
to debt. An indebted future is unlikely to encourage some of
our poorest families into tertiary study.’</p><p>There is
already inequality between student beneficiaries and other
beneficiaries. For example, most students are ineligible for
the Accommodation Supplement provided for all other
low-income New Zealanders, including beneficiaries. Instead,
only some students are entitled to the Accommodation
Benefit, which is up to $105 per week less than the
Accommodation Supplement.

<p>A single person aged under 24,
living in Auckland, is eligible for $177.03 per week as a
beneficiary or student allowance recipient, plus a maximum
of $145 in Accommodation Supplement or $40 in Accommodation
Benefit.  </p><p>‘Where is the incentive to go into tertiary
study if it involves forgoing $320 cash from a benefit in
exchange for $215 debt from a student loan per week?
Tertiary education should be a path out of poverty, not a
way into it,’ says Gee.</p><p>‘Free tertiary education and a
living allowance for low-income New Zealanders who are
studying should not be a trade-off.’</p><p>NZUSA is the
national voice of students in tertiary education. The
organisation is owned by students’ associations from
universities and polytechnics across the
country.</p><p><br>ENDS</p><p><br>
