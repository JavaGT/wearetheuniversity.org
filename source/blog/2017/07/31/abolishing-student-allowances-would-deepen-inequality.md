<p>A single person aged under 24,
living in Auckland, is eligible for $177.03 per week as a
beneficiary or student allowance recipient, plus a maximum
of $145 in Accommodation Supplement or $40 in Accommodation
Benefit.<p>

<p>‘Where is the incentive to go into tertiary
study if it involves forgoing $320 cash from a benefit in
exchange for $215 debt from a student loan per week?
Tertiary education should be a path out of poverty, not a
way into it,’ says Gee.</p>

<p>‘Free tertiary education and a
living allowance for low-income New Zealanders who are
studying should not be a trade-off.’</p>

<p>NZUSA is the
national voice of students in tertiary education. The
organisation is owned by students’ associations from
universities and polytechnics across the
country.</p>
