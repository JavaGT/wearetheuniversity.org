         CUTTING NEARLY 200 GENERAL STAFF PUTS OTAGO UNI’S
WORLD-CLASS REPUTATION AT RISK</p><p>Staff at the University of
Otago are deeply concerned about the impact Vice-Chancellor
Harlene Hayne’s plan to cut 182 full time equivalent jobs
will have on students and the university’s ability to
continue providing world class learning
opportunities.</p><p>Hayne told staff at a meeting earlier this
afternoon that she is planning a massive shake-up in the way
support services are delivered at the university. Under
Hayne’s plans, vital support services, such as student
advice and support, would be cut from individual departments
and replaced by more standardised services.</p><p>Hayne has been
told that the consequences of losing nearly two hundred
general staff would soon be felt in the classroom. General
staff are vital to the current and future success of the
institution and the loss of so many will put the
university’s reputation as a centre of world-class
research and teaching at risk, Hayne was told.</p><p>Shaun
Scott, organiser of the Tertiary Education Union branch at
the University, said: “Our members are naturally concerned
about what these proposals will mean for themselves and
their families. But equally, they are extremely worried
about the risks posed to the institution. The scale of what
Professor Hayne is planning will significantly and
detrimentally impact on the work carried out by general
staff. This will negatively impact on the service required
to deliver high quality teaching and learning, research and
student support. Our members will be working together to do
everything they can to highlight the detrimental impact
Professor Hayne’s plans will have, not only on staff but
on future generations of students too.</p><p>Today’s
announcement is the latest stage in a Support Services
Review that was launched in 2015 [1]. Staff will have from
now until the end of August to respond to the proposals,
with a final announcement due to be made in September.
However, individual staff members could face a much longer
wait to find out if they will still have a job under
Hayne’s
plans.</p><p>--ENDS--
