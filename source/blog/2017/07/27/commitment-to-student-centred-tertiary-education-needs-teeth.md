<p>On other aspects of the Government’s
response to the Commission’s report, NZUSA is pleased that
the Minister has rejected recommendations around interest on
student loans and variable subsidies to tuition fees for
courses of ‘high private return’. We are also pleased
that he is willing to explore developing a framework for
tertiary teaching. However, Gee was cautious at suggestions
to continue to consider changes to fee regulation and to
review the requirement for research-led teaching in
degree-level study.</p>

<p>‘Barrier-free, affordable and
equitable access to tertiary education needs to be front and
centre of any changes to the system. We would expect active
engagement and consultation with students on any possible
changes to tuition fees or the way we are taught,’ Gee
says.</p>

<p>In referring to the Minister’s commitment that
tertiary education should meet the needs of industry and
employers, NZUSA noted that students’ needs also need to
be prioritised.</p>

<p>‘The Minister himself referred to the
importance of tertiary education in deepening our
understanding of ourselves, our history, the world and
finding solutions to our many challenges. Skills that match
with the needs of industry are essential, but we must
equally prioritise tertiary education’s role as a powerful
social lever that transforms the lives of individuals and
their communities.’</p>

<p>‘We look forward to working with
Government to ensure that tertiary education is working best
for students.’</p>

<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students
in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by
students' associations from universities and polytechnics
around the
country.</p>
