	 <p>
         AUSA remains in NZUSA</p><p>Auckland University Students’
Association (AUSA) has formally cancelled its resignation
from the New Zealand Union of Students’ Association
(NZUSA), choosing to retain full membership. </p><p>The
decision, made by the AUSA Executive at its meeting on the
10th of July, reverses the notice of resignation given by
the 2016 Executive. Resignation from NZUSA comes with a
notice period of one year, though the 2017 Executive
requested an extension to this period in order to more fully
consider its position. </p><p>AUSA’s decision to withdraw the
notice was also influenced by a recent meeting with NZUSA
President Jonathan Gee, Executive Director Alistair Shaw,
and Victoria Students’ Association President Rory
Lenihan-Ikan to discuss the progress NZUSA had made on
issues raised by the AUAS Executive.  </p><p>AUSA President Will
Matthews says: ‘When the 2016 Executive gave notice of its
resignation, it raised four key issues - NZUSA’s
communication, professionalism, effectiveness in working
with government, and value for money’. </p><p>‘We have
engaged with NZUSA over the last year on these issues, and
the Executive is really pleased to see some major
improvements taking place within NZUSA to address them’.
</p><p>‘What I’ve been hearing from the Executive, and from
University of Auckland students, is that they are keen to
see further improvements made, and that they also want to
continue the conversation about how much it costs for AUSA
to be a member of NZUSA’. </p><p>‘Generally, we’re really
looking forward to a positive and productive relationship
with NZUSA in the future, and we’re happy to be back’.
