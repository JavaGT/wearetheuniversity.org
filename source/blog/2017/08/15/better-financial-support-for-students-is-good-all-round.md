<p>‘Students, their parents and their
grandparents, and intending students, tell us they want
enough to live while they study, to address the acute
financial crisis that students currently face – and to
graduate with less debt. The poll confirms that the rest of
the country agrees.’</p>

<p>‘It’s time for all parties
to respond to this call. Better financial support is good
for students, and good for the country.’</p>

<p>ENDS<p>
