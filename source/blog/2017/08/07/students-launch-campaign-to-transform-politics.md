<p>This style of campaigning is
bold. It’s about using new technologies, and the social
connections that define the lives of many young people to
bring their ways of doing politics to the
election.</p>

<p>‘Students and young people are an incredibly
diverse community and no one size fits all approach has any
hope of being successful. Our campus teams have the ability
to speak to the communities they know best, and in ways that
make sense to them,’ says Jonathan.</p>

<p>‘We Have Power
aims to flip the misconstrued narrative that low youth voter
turnout is due to apathy. Instead, the movement believes
that politics has failed to speak to the aspirations,
experiences and lived realities of young people which has
led to this disillusionment. By voting, we have the power to
change things.’</p>

<p>WHP volunteer Moana Potaka (Ngati
Whakaue, Tapuika, Waitaha, Ngati Wai), 28, business studies
student at Eastern Institute of Technology, says ‘many of
the barriers to education facing students like low income,
poor housing, and lack of ability to travel to campus can be
fixed by politicians. If politicians used their power to
stand up for students, students would use their power to
vote them into Parliament.’</p>

<p>WHP volunteer Emily Barker,
22, fine arts student at the University of Canterbury says
it is crucial that we empower young people to vote, ‘at
the end of the day, we will inherit the outcomes of this
election.’</p>

<p>We Have Power is a campaign coordinated by
the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations
(NZUSA).</p>
