<p>Victoria University of Wellington
Students’ Association (VUWSA) has long campaigned for a
student discount on public transport in the Wellington
region, including lobbying the Greater Wellington Regional
Council. VUWSA President Rory Lenihan-Ikin says, ‘Students
are telling us the cost of getting to class is so high that
they’re skipping class. This is backed by lecturers who
have seen their class numbers drop as the cost of living for
students grows each year.’</p>

<p>‘Having student fares on
public transport is the norm for most major cities around
the world, so these policies would bring us a step closer to
competing globally for more people to live, study and go on
to work in New Zealand,’ says Lenihan-Ikin.</p>

<p>NZUSA is the
national voice of students in tertiary education. The
organisation is governed by students’ associations from
universities and polytechnics around the
country.</p>
