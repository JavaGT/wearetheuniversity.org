<p>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o
Aotearoa<br><strong>One Hundred Tertiary Education Stories
That National Needs to Hear</strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>The
power of publicly funded tertiary education to change lives
and transform communities is confirmed today by a collection
of personal stories told by those who know just how
important public tertiary education is to them, their
whānau, their employers and hapori whānui.</p>

<p><i>Talking Tertiary Education is a collection
of nearly one hundred stories</i> gathered by the
Tertiary Education Union to show the transformative power of
public education. The collection starts a talanoa, a
conversation, about the benefits of public tertiary
education where people’s stories do the talking [1]. Each
story reinforces that tertiary education belongs to all of
us, because it benefits all of us.</p>

<p>Personal, persuasive
and powerful, the stories aim to expand politicians’
understanding of what it means to have a publicly-funded,
locally accessible tertiary education system that is focused
on learning, not profit. They tell how public tertiary
education helps to reduce inequity and contributes to
lifelong learning opportunities that allow us to fulfil our
potential as individuals and as members of whānau and
communities.</p>

<p>Sandra Grey, national president of the
Tertiary Education Union, said: <strong>“Each of these
stories is a powerful reminder of why it is so important to
keep tertiary education public, local and focused on
learning. Whether told by a young person figuring out their
path, someone changing careers later in life, learning new
skills or finding their passion, what is clear from these
stories is that it’s public tertiary education that
supports them on their way.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>“The
collection of stories recognises the huge difference public,
locally focussed tertiary education makes to people’s
lives. It’s a talanoa with one hundred compelling reasons
why National’s law to divert funding away from public
universities, polytechnics and wānanga must not be passed.
MPs should read each story carefully to remind themselves
why they should be supporting high quality public tertiary
education for the range of social, political, and economic
benefits it brings the people of
Aotearoa.”</strong><strong></strong><br><strong>--ENDS--</strong><strong></strong></p>
