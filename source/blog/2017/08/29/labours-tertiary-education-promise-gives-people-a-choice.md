         <strong>Labour’s Tertiary Education Promise Gives People a
Real Choice at This Election</strong></p><p>Labour’s promise
to give everyone one year full-time study free means voters
have a real choice this election about the future of public
tertiary education, the Tertiary Education Union said
today.</p><p>Jacinda Ardern announced this morning that under a
Labour Government anyone starting tertiary education for the
first time in 2018 would receive a year of full-time study
without having to pay fees. Labour also committed to
increase student support by $50 a week from the start of
next year.</p><p>Sandra Grey, national president of the Tertiary
Education Union, said: <strong>“It is great to see that
Labour has listened to tertiary education staff and students
by committing to policies that will improve access to
learning opportunities for many.</strong></p><p><strong>“The
announcement follows in the wake of commitments from Labour,
the Greens and New Zealand First to keep tertiary education
public. This means that when people cast their vote in
September they have a real opportunity to vote for a
credible and popular alternative to the clear failings of
National’s market-based approach to tertiary
education.”</strong></p><p><br>ENDS</p><p><br>
