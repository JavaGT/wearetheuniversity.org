<p><strong>Advisory: Auckland politicians to address local
meeting to keep tertiary education public</strong></p>

<p>Today
at 4.30pm in Old Government House, Princes Street, Auckland,
politicians and candidates from Labour, the Greens and
Māori Party will address a public meeting to discuss
National’s plans to change the law to funnel public money
into private education.</p>

<p>Green Party MP, Denise Roche,
Labour’s candidate for Auckland Central, Helen White, and
George Ngatai, chair of the Tāmaki Makaurau branch of the
Māori Party, will address the meeting. Unfortunately Nikki
Kaye, MP for Auckland Central and Minister for Education, is
unable to attend due to other commitments.</p>

<p>Other speakers
include Will Mathews, AUSA President, Chris Walker, NZEI,
David Cooke, Unitec, Sean Sturm, TEU University of Auckland
Branch Committee member, and Sandra Grey, national president
of the TEU.</p>

<p>The Education (Tertiary Education and Other
Matters) Amendment Bill would funnel public money into
private tertiary education institutions and undermine
quality public education in New Zealand. TEU members and
student activists across New Zealand have been coming
together to discuss the Bill and write submissions to the
Select Committee so the government understands that they
can’t quietly sneak through changes which will threaten
public, local tertiary education in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Full
details of the meeting are:<br>Date: 13th June 2017<br>Time:
4.30 – 5.30pm<br>Venue: Old Government House, Princes
Street,
Auckland</p>
