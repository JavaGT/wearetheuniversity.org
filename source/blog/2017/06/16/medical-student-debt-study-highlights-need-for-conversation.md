<p>Gee says that rising
student debt requires immediate action by the Government.
The first step would be by addressing the rising cost of
living for students. Living costs make up a third of the
national student loan balance.</p>

<p>‘An immediate step to
lessen the burden of student loan debt is to increase access
to the Student Allowance, which currently only 33% of
students have access to.’</p>

<p>Gee says that, more
importantly, a national conversation about student debt
needs to take place in order to combat inequality.</p>

<p>‘Loan
debt is not just a student issue. Tertiary education is a
public good and we owe it to future generations to have a
national conversation about student debt and its impact on
society.’</p>

<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in
tertiary education. The organisation is governed by
students’ associations from universities and polytechnics
around the
country.</p>
