         22 May 2017</p><p><strong>Students release Budget
wishlist</strong></p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations (NZUSA) has released a list of changes it says
will begin to restore access to tertiary education ahead of
this Thursday’s Government Budget announcement. The
desired changes come amid findings of student hardship in a
recent Unitec survey, as well as NZUSA’s 2017 Income and
Expenditure Report.</p><p>National President Jonathan Gee said
the rising cost of living, in particular skyrocketing rents,
were locking out too many New Zealanders from tertiary
education.</p><p>“There is an increasing poverty of
opportunity for many New Zealanders who choose not to enter
tertiary study simply because they cannot afford it. The
upcoming Budget is also a chance for the Government to
provide urgent relief for many students struggling to afford
rent, let alone food and other basic needs.’</p><p>The average
rent price for a room in central Auckland has now exceeded
$250, surpassing the maximum Student Allowance and
Accommodation Benefit of $218. For the 70% of students
locked out of the Student Allowance, rent prices are well
above the $178.81 of Student Loan living costs. The
situation is similar in Wellington, where the average rent
price is approximately $218, up 10% since November 2016 in
dramatic contrast to the increase in student support of just
$1 in that same period.</p><p><strong>Students’ Budget
Wishlist:</strong><br>1.	<strong>Introduce a housing grant
for all students. </strong>This grant would be variable to
target the cities where weekly rent is consuming over 100%
of current levels of student
support.<br>2.	<strong>Introduce a national First in Family
scholarship. </strong>This scholarship would be targeted at
families with no history of degree-level study. This will
increase participation from underrepresented communities in
tertiary education.<br>3.	<strong>Reform the unfair 12c
repayment rate on Student Loans.

<div class="headline-right"></div>

</strong></div></div><strong>
</strong><p><strong> </strong>People with
student loans must repay 12c in the dollar once they start
earning $19,136, less than 60% of the annual salary for a
minimum wage earner. </p><p>Replace it with an Australian-style
progressive repayment system so that those on lower incomes
pay less and can have enough take home pay to
survive.</p><p>4.	<strong>Restore postgraduate
allowances.</strong> The cut has hurt New Zealanders who
should be supported to research and innovate, and is
especially significant as teaching qualifications shift to
Masters level</p><p>5.	<strong>Raise the parental income
threshold on Student Allowance. </strong>Only 30% of student
have access to the Allowance. Raise the threshold to a
reasonable rate so fewer students graduate with unmanageable
debt.</p><p>6.	<strong>Restore the national significance
exceptions on Student Allowance.</strong> Make an exception
to the 200-week limit on Allowances, by restoring a category
of qualifications of national significance. This would
support student pursuing qualifications such as medicine,
optometry, dentistry and veterinary
science.</p><p>7.	<strong>Restore full access for over-40s to
Student Allowances and Allowances and Loans for over-65s.
</strong>Many New Zealanders enter tertiary education later
in life to upskill and retrain. Don’t discriminate against
them purely because of their age.</p><p>8.	<strong>Lift the
course-related costs loan cap.</strong> This has been frozen
at $1000 since 1993. Students are getting into bank and
credit card debt just to pay for basics like upfront hall
costs and necessary educational materials.</p><p>NZUSA is the
national voice of students in tertiary education. The
organisation is governed by students’ associations from
universities and polytechnics around the
country.<br><strong>ENDS</strong></p><p>
