<strong>
</strong><p><strong> </strong>People with
student loans must repay 12c in the dollar once they start
earning $19,136, less than 60% of the annual salary for a
minimum wage earner. </p>

<p>Replace it with an Australian-style
progressive repayment system so that those on lower incomes
pay less and can have enough take home pay to
survive.</p>

<p>4.	<strong>Restore postgraduate
allowances.</strong> The cut has hurt New Zealanders who
should be supported to research and innovate, and is
especially significant as teaching qualifications shift to
Masters level</p>

<p>5.	<strong>Raise the parental income
threshold on Student Allowance. </strong>Only 30% of student
have access to the Allowance. Raise the threshold to a
reasonable rate so fewer students graduate with unmanageable
debt.</p>

<p>6.	<strong>Restore the national significance
exceptions on Student Allowance.</strong> Make an exception
to the 200-week limit on Allowances, by restoring a category
of qualifications of national significance. This would
support student pursuing qualifications such as medicine,
optometry, dentistry and veterinary
science.</p>

<p>7.	<strong>Restore full access for over-40s to
Student Allowances and Allowances and Loans for over-65s.
</strong>Many New Zealanders enter tertiary education later
in life to upskill and retrain. Don’t discriminate against
them purely because of their age.</p>

<p>8.	<strong>Lift the
course-related costs loan cap.</strong> This has been frozen
at $1000 since 1993. Students are getting into bank and
credit card debt just to pay for basics like upfront hall
costs and necessary educational materials.</p>

<p>NZUSA is the
national voice of students in tertiary education. The
organisation is governed by students’ associations from
universities and polytechnics around the
country.<br><strong>ENDS</strong></p><p>
