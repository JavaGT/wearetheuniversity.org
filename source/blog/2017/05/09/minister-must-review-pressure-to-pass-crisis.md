Kahurangi o Aotearoa<br>9 May 2017</p><p><strong>MINISTER MUST
REVIEW PRESSURE TO PASS CRISIS BEFORE ENSHRINING IN LAW
NATIONAL’S FAILED APPROACH TO TERTIARY
EDUCATION</strong></p><p><strong>National’s approach to
tertiary education is putting staff under immense pressure
to pass students and must be the subject of a thorough
sector-wide review before further changes are enshrined in
law, the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) said
today.</strong></p><p>The call for a review coincides with
publication of a ‘stress dossier’ [1] outlining more
than 500 anonymous comments the TEU received from staff in
response to its recent State of the Sector survey [2]. The
dossier includes hundreds of examples of where staff have
been put under pressure to change students’ marks and
alter assessments, shining a light on what it’s like to
work in a tertiary education sector run by
National.</p><p>Comments contained in the dossier include:</p><p>·
“Ever since funding was linked to retention and success
there has been pressure from management to pass more
students while at the same time wanting more full-time
students.”</p><p>· “I see students year after year who in
their first steps in the university are already set up to
fail because they do not have the requisite skills for
academic study and should not actually be at
university.”</p><p>· “We have been required to remove all
internal compulsory items from our course. Now all
assessment items are no longer compulsory. This was done
with the rationale that more passes means more
funding.”

<p>Publication of the dossier coincides with the
expected first reading this week of a controversial law that
could see funding stripped away from public education and
handed to private businesses. Copies of the dossier will be
taken to Parliament this afternoon and presented to the
tertiary education spokespeople for Labour, the Greens and
New Zealand First, as well as staff in the Minister’s
office.</p><p>Sandra Grey, TEU national president, said
<strong>: “National wants to enshrine into law its guiding
principle of putting profit before students without first
reviewing the impact this is having on the quality of
tertiary education. The very least the public should expect
from National is a thorough review of the tertiary education
reforms it has introduced before the Minister presses ahead
and puts into law an approach this dossier suggests has
failed. The review needs to hear directly from staff about
what it’s like to work the sector, including the dossier's
suggestion that staff are increasingly expected to set aside
their commitment to quality education and change marks to
fit National’s funding priorities.”</strong></p><p>Jonathan
Gee, president of the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations, said:<strong> "The dossier reveals some of the
unintended consequences that the tertiary education funding
model has created. When staff are feeling the pressure to
pass students, or admit them into courses that they aren't
ready for, tertiary education is failing to do its job of
producing well-educated and well-rounded graduates. If the
system continues in its current direction, we pose the risk
of turning tertiary institutions into degree factories
rather than places where students genuinely learn, grow and
succeed."</strong></p><p><strong>--ENDS--</strong></p><p>Note:
</p><p>[2] The State of the Sector survey was first published in
March 2017. The report presented the findings from the
survey but not the individual comments that were received.
