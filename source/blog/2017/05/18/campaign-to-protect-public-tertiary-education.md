<p><strong>Campaign to protect public tertiary education from
National’s law to launch</strong></p>

<p><strong>MAY 18,
2017</strong></p>

<p>Tertiary Update Vol 20 No 18</p>

<p>Staff,
students and representatives of the local community will
come together tomorrow at the Ara Institute of Canterbury to
launch the TEU’s campaign to protect quality public
tertiary education from a controversial law prioritising
for-profit providers.</p>

<p>Join
the campaign here and show National that Kiwis want properly
funded public tertiary education.</p>

<p>National’s law
will amend the Education Act to enshrine a funding approach
that has already been trialled at some levels of tertiary
education provision and led to the closure of courses in
small rural and regional communities where institutes of
technology and polytechnics have lost out to for-profit
providers.</p>

<p>TEU’s campaign will bring together voices
from across the sector and the local community to lobby MPs
and organise submissions to the Select Committee,
highlighting that tertiary education belongs to us
all.</p>

<p>“Tertiary education belongs to all of us and that
is what our campaign is all about. To win, we need as many
people as possible to stand with us,” Sandra Grey, TEU
national president, said.</p>

<p>If enough people speak out and
MPs grasp the transformative power of public tertiary
education for individuals and society then this Bill can be
stopped.</p>

<p>The campaign will make clear that harnessing this
transformative power is best served by prioritising access
to education for all citizens, maintaining the role of
education as critic and conscience of society and improving
the working conditions of staff.<p>

<p>“If this law passes
vast sums of public money intended for polytechnics,
universities and wānanga could soon be used to support
companies that prioritise profit over education. We need as
many voices as possible from around the country to tell
National that this is not how we want tertiary education run
in this country,” Grey added.</p>

<p>National’s contentious law passed its first
reading last week and has been handed to the Education and Science
Select Committee for more detailed deliberation.</p>

<p>Ara was
chosen as the site for the launch because a recent
consultation document published by management of the
institution cited competition from for-profit providers as
one reason why it is planning to close six
courses.<br><p>
