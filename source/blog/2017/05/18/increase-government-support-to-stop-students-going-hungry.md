         <strong>Increase government support to stop students going
hungry</strong></p><p><strong>MAY 18, 2017</strong></p><p>Students
at Unitec are regularly going without food or other
necessities because they cannot afford them, according to a
survey of students by the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations (NZUSA).</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1705/S00200/unitec-survey-renews-calls-for-urgent-support-increase.htm" target="_blank">survey results</a> have reignited calls on
National to increase student support.</p><p>With the budget
announced next Thursday, NZUSA is calling on Finance
Minister Steven Joyce and Tertiary Education, Skills and
Employment Minister Paul Goldsmith to increase the
inadequate $218 Student Allowance.</p><p>Half of those surveyed,
including two-thirds of Māori students, said their income
was not enough to cover their living costs at some stage in
the past year.</p><p>Two-thirds said they had “seriously
considered” dropping out of study due to financial or
work-study-life pressures. For Māori students, nearly half
considered withdrawing before course
completion.</p><p>“Tertiary study should be a way out of
poverty, not a way into it. What the survey results show is
that the cost of study is a huge disincentive for many to
continue with tertiary education,” Jonathan Gee, national
president of NZUSA, said.</p><p>Unitec is the country’s
biggest campus-based polytechnic with 9,100
fulltime-equivalent students. In some cases staff have been
asked to donate food and linen to help students struggling
to pay rising rents and other living costs.

<p>Sharn Riggs,
national secretary of the TEU, said: “These findings are
deeply worrying and expose National’s failure to make sure
student support keeps pace with rising living costs. If
student support continues to stagnate then tertiary
education faces the very real risk of becoming a luxury only
a few can afford. We cannot let that happen.”</p><p>Many
students expect to make their own financial contribution on
top of support from the Government. However, half of
full-time students at Unitec are now working more than 15
hours a week to makes ends meet, meaning that paid work is
affecting students’ academic
success.</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
