<p>Transfer of Funds From Public to Private Tertiary Education
an Ideological Choice</p>

<p>Today’s budget will cut funding to
public tertiary education, handing millions of dollars of
public funds to the private sector.</p>

<p>Commenting on the
announcement, Tertiary Education Union National Secretary,
Sharn Riggs, said: “Today, Steven Joyce announced that
National would cut more than $15.5 million in funding to our
public universities and polytechnics, while increasing
funding to private providers by almost $24 million
[1].</p>

<p>“This is a budget of ideological choice, not of
necessity. Public tertiary education institutions are
responsible for some of the most creative and innovative
teaching in the country. On the other hand, recent stories
show a litany of private providers trying to rort the system
and closing when they get caught. The government's decision
to ignore such evidence is the result of an ideological
preference for for-profit tertiary providers.</p>

<p>"Paul
Goldsmith will tell us that he is increasing funding to the
sector by 1 percent, but this belies the fact that most of
that increase is being handed to private business. While
public funds are pumped into failing, profit-driven
providers, other public institutions remain under-funded,
and face even further cutbacks if a planned law change goes
ahead.</p>

<p>“This will further open New Zealand’s tertiary
education sector to private providers and National is acting
as if it has already passed. Let’s reject this approach
and instead work for a public education system that suits
the needs of the students it serves and the staff who
deliver
it.”<br>--ENDS--</p>
