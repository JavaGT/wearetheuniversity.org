<p>UOA DIVESTMENT IN FOSSIL FUELS: GREEN-LIT OR NO?</p>

<p>The
contribution of Fossil Fuels to the global phenomenon of
Climate Change is apparent. Scientists across the world
continuously confirm the effects of global warming and other
conditional events to have an active and ongoing effect on
the way our planet operates and adapts. This ordinarily
would be a process of change which allows the planet to
‘breathe’, yet with the human modification of the
system, to a degree in which our atmosphere and subsequently
weather systems, are altered now indefinitely. Something
needs to change.</p>

<p>Presently, University of Auckland
students are taking to a march on campus directed at the
Vice-Chancellor Dr. Stuart McCutcheson to divest in fossil
fuels. This comes off the back of a sit-in protest at the
university’s Clocktower merely days before. After years of
attempted change, this really is the culmination of their
hard work- two years of event-holding; petition signing;
awareness campaigns and lecture presentations, to be led in
a forced sit-in and the subsequent march.</p>

<p>In its
background sits the decision of Victoria University’s
Vice-Chancellor Grant Guilford in choosing to listen to the
students and staff’s calls for divestment. This coincides
with Otago University’s additional motion of support in
favour of divestment. Here, the message has been made clear:
Fossil fuels are ruining our planet. The University of
Auckland has been providing massive injections of investment
via its University of Auckland Foundation, fully aware that
its donations are building upon companies and initiatives
that use fossil fuel prospecting and extraction.<p>
<p>Student
protest is often a maximum effort for little gain, but in
this instance it has proven successful across a number of
institutions, and the actions given by UoA’s students may
indeed prove the turning of the tide against the mind of
McCutcheson.</p>

<p>It is the hope therefore, of the students;
staff and alumni, that the university will divest in its
investment of millions into the Fossil Fuel industry. In
this electric moment, hopefully their Vice-Chancellor will
listen, engage in, and understand the dangers that our
planet faces. It is yet to be seen whether the modus
operandi of ‘University as a business’ remains a reality
being faced in today’s civic environment as the shouts and
cries of the protest begin to
lift.</p>
