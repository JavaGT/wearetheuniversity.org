<p><strong>AUCKLAND STUDENTS MARCH FOR
DIVESTMENT</strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of students and staff at the
University of Auckland will be rallying today (Wednesday
31st May) to make their opposition to University investment
in fossil fuels heard, and to call on Vice Chancellor Stuart
McCutcheon to take publicly support fossil fuel
divestment</p>

<p>The march, which will begin in the University
Quad at 12:30pm, is being run by Fossil Free UoA and
Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA), and
comes days after Fossil Free UoA activists staged a 12 hour
occupation of the Vice Chancellor’s wing of the University
Clocktower.<p>

<p>After gathering in the Quad, students will
march to the front of the Clocktower, where speeches will be
made by Fossil Free UoA organisers, University academics,
AUSA President Will Matthews, and Green Party candidate
Chloe Swarbrick.<p>

<p>The rally comes after more than two
years of Fossil Free UoA and AUSA campaigning for the
University of Auckland Foundation to relinquish its
financial interests in fossil fuel companies,and establish
an ethical investment policy<strong>. </strong>During this
time both Victoria University and Otago University, and
hundreds of institutions across the world have formally
divested. In 2016, AUSA brought a petition in favour of
divestment to the University Council, which was ignored.<p>

<p>“AUSA has been a partner of Fossil Free UoA on this
issue since 2015”, says Matthews</p>

<p>“We have gone through
the traditional routes by formally appealing to the Vice
Chancellor and the University Council to make a strong
statement in favour of divestment, and they’ve ignored us.
Now it’s time to come out in force and ask the Vice
Chancellor to make a stand”.<p>
<p>“The Vice Chancellor at
Victoria University has listened to his students and come
out in favour of divestment. It’s time for our Vice
Chancellor to let us know who’s side he is on - his
students, or the fossil fuel companies.”</p>

<p><strong>The
March for Divestment will gather  in the University Quad at
12pm. All are welcome to attend. </strong></p>
