<p>STAFF AT AUCKLAND
UNIVERSITY TO STRIKE FOR FAIR PAY</p>

<p><strong>All staff at the
University of Auckland should be given a fair and equitable
increase in their pay, the TEU said today after announcing
university staff would take strike action on 16 March [1] as
part of a campaign to achieve an equitable outcome from pay
negotiations [2].</strong></p>

<p>Negotiations with university
management have been ongoing for more than seven months,
during which time the TEU has sought to secure the fairest
possible outcome for all university staff, including a
cost-neutral flat rate pay increase, fair pay for
professional staff and the Living Wage for university
employees.</p>

<p>In an effort to avoid strike action, the TEU
recently proposed a 1.2 percent pay increase in 2017
followed by a flat rate pay rise of $1,200 from 1 February
2018, as well as an increase of $3,500 for those at the
bottom of the professional pay scale. A flat rate pay rise
would also make an important contribution to addressing the
gender pay imbalance, as there are significantly more women
in professional staff roles at the university.</p>

<p>The
proposal was rejected by the employer in favour of a 1.2
percent increase in pay for two consecutive years, with a
commitment to discuss the merits of a flat rate rise after
the first year. However, if discussions about a flat rate
rise were unsuccessful, TEU members would have no recourse
as it is illegal to take strike action during the term of an
agreement.<p>

<p>John Egan, Academic co-president of the TEU at
Auckland University, said: <strong>“We don’t take the
decision to go on strike lightly—our preference is to
conduct our research and to teach. However, academic and
professional staff all make vital contributions towards
maintaining the University of Auckland as one of the best
places in New Zealand to study. It’s not too late for
senior management to avoid strike action. All they have to
do is return to the table and offer staff a fair and
equitable flat rate pay increase for 2018. Our academic
members are willing to take a lower increase to offset the
inadequate wages of our professional staff colleagues—we
want less, not more.”</strong></p>

<p>Josanne Blyth,
Professional staff co-president of the TEU at Auckland
University, said: <strong>“For the last seven months we
have been trying to persuade senior management to give staff
the same pay increase no matter how much they earn. Their
offer to discuss a flat rate rise in a year’s time is not
good enough and would tie our members’ hands. A percentage
increase is the wrong approach to take as it simply means
the highest paid receive the largest rises. Staff are really
proud to work here and would be prouder still if management
recognised the equal value of the work people do by giving
all staff the same increase in pay.”</strong></p>

<p>Speaking
in favour of strike action, Mark Amsler, Associate Professor
in the Faculty of Arts at Auckland University, said:
<strong>“It is a disappointing for staff to be put in a
position where securing a fair pay agreement for our lower
earning colleagues means having to go on strike. But we are
a collective, and that's what you do. Providing all staff
with a fair and equitable boost in their pay should be a
priority for senior management. I hope they return to the
negotiating table and agree to the TEU’s proposal so we
all can focus on giving our students the best possible start
to the academic year.”</strong></p>

<p>Also speaking in favour
of strike action Nicole Wallace, Group Services Co-ordinator
at the University of Auckland, said: <strong>“We work
extremely hard to make sure the university provides a
positive learning environment for students. With the cost of
living in Auckland rising, the need for a flat rate increase
in pay is more important than
ever.”</strong></p>
