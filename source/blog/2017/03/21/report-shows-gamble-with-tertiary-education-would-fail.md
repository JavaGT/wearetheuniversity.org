Kahurangi o Aotearoa<br>20 March 2017</p><p><strong>PRODUCTIVITY
COMMISSION'S REPORT SHOWS GOLDSMITH'S GAMBLE WITH TERTIARY
EDUCATION WOULD FAIL</strong></p><p><strong>Tertiary education
Minister Paul Goldsmith would be taking a reckless gamble
with Kiwis’ futures if he adopts the recommendations of
the Productivity Commission’s report [1] into the future
of the sector, sending a clear signal ahead of the election
that the market comes before the interests of staff and
students, the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) said
today.</strong></p><p>The Productivity Commission’s report
<i>New models of tertiary education</i> correctly identifies
that reforms introduced by the National-led government have
inhibited, rather than supported, people in tertiary
education to show innovation in teaching and research. But
rather than reforming the system to serve the needs of
students, staff and local communities, the report recommends
the Minister introduces more of the same market-driven
approaches it concludes have failed.</p><p>Adopting the
commission’s wide-ranging recommendations would increase
the influence the market has over the future of tertiary
education provision, diminishing the role of elected
politicians that have a responsibility to our students and
their communities. The report’s vision for tertiary
education is one of market-based competition and profit,
rather than the delivery of broad-based, publicly-funded
programmes that meet community, iwi and hapū, business,
industry and service provider needs. Paul Goldsmith recently
tabled a draft law to reform the tertiary education sector
that shares a similar vision [2].

<p>Responding to the report
Sandra Grey, TEU national president, said: “ <strong>The
report clearly shows that the current government’s
approach to tertiary education is not working, but then
bizarrely recommends it does more of the same. If the
Minister accepts these recommendations he would be heading
into the election asking the public to invest its tax
dollars in the tertiary education sector only for the
rewards to be privatised.</strong></p><p><strong>“The timing
of this report is also interesting, following as it does so
soon after the Minister proposed a draft law that would lay
the foundation for the next phase of market expansion in
tertiary education. It seems strange to propose such
sweeping changes weeks before the commission his government
asked to advise on the future direction of the sector had a
chance to report.</strong></p><p><strong>“Having now reported
we can see that the market-based reforms Paul Goldsmith’s
flagship law will entrench have failed. The Minister would
be wise to consider the commission’s findings before
making any further changes that could reduce access to
tertiary education for millions of
Kiwis.”</strong></p><p><strong>--ENDS--</strong></p><p><strong>Notes
