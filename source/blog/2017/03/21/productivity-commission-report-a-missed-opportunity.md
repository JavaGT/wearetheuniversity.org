<p>“Interest on
student loans sends the wrong message to prospective
students and their parents about who we want to access
tertiary education.”</p>

<p>NZUSA is also concerned about the
recommendation to abolish University Entrance.</p>

<p>“Students
want the certainty of having a target that gets them into a
university. Removing it is not in students’
interest.”</p>

<p>Recommending that the Government should
adjust fee subsidy rates over time to reduce subsidies (or
pay no subsidies) is short-sighted and does not acknowledge
the public good of greater participation in tertiary
education.</p>

<p>“The suggestion that some courses offer
higher returns than others is a big generalisation. For
example, applying less of a subsidy to law graduates could
incentivise them to work just as commercial lawyers rather
than in community law centres, as they struggle to repay
their student loan.”</p>

<p>NZUSA, however, welcomes the
Commission’s call for better career education for school
students.</p>

<p>“Good, consistent career information and
guidance for school students is severely lacking. Improving
career education helps all students from all backgrounds get
a better understanding of what qualifications they need to
achieve their dreams.”</p>

<p>“The Productivity Commission
proposes deregulation to support innovation, but by doing so
it fails to protect, let alone enhance, student interests in
tertiary
education.”</p>
