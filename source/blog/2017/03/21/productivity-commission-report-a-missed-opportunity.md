         20 March 2017</p><p>EMBARGOED UNTIL 5.00AM 21 MARCH
2017</p><p><strong>Productivity Commission Report a Missed
Opportunity to Put Students at the Centre of the
System</strong></p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations (NZUSA) is disappointed by the recommendations
in the Productivity Commission’s final report on new
models of tertiary education, released today.</p><p>While the
Commission has made some promising recommendations,
including the provision of better careers education for
prospective and current students, it has failed to
meaningfully advance student interests.</p><p>“This report is
a missed opportunity to put students at the centre of the
education system. The Productivity Commission has said they
have empowered student choice, but instead they’re giving
power to tertiary education institutions to do what they
like,” says Jonathan Gee, National President of
NZUSA.</p><p>The Commission has gone outside their terms of
reference to push for the introduction of interest on
student loans.</p><p>“The Commission was tasked to 'focus on
fee-setting and not on student support (i.e. student loans
and allowances),' yet it has gone ahead and suggested
imposing interest on student loans. They have gone outside
their brief in support of an unpopular and ineffective
proposal.”</p><p>“The Commission is being disingenuous by
suggesting that the Government subsidises those who get more
private benefit (i.e. higher incomes) as a result of their
qualification. The subsidy actually goes to those who do not
have higher incomes and therefore do not repay their loan as
quickly. People who earn more get very little subsidy as
their loans are paid back quicker.”

<p>“Interest on
student loans sends the wrong message to prospective
students and their parents about who we want to access
tertiary education.”</p><p>NZUSA is also concerned about the
recommendation to abolish University Entrance.</p><p>“Students
want the certainty of having a target that gets them into a
university. Removing it is not in students’
interest.”</p><p>Recommending that the Government should
adjust fee subsidy rates over time to reduce subsidies (or
pay no subsidies) is short-sighted and does not acknowledge
the public good of greater participation in tertiary
education.</p><p>“The suggestion that some courses offer
higher returns than others is a big generalisation. For
example, applying less of a subsidy to law graduates could
incentivise them to work just as commercial lawyers rather
than in community law centres, as they struggle to repay
their student loan.”</p><p>NZUSA, however, welcomes the
Commission’s call for better career education for school
students.</p><p>“Good, consistent career information and
guidance for school students is severely lacking. Improving
career education helps all students from all backgrounds get
a better understanding of what qualifications they need to
achieve their dreams.”</p><p>“The Productivity Commission
proposes deregulation to support innovation, but by doing so
it fails to protect, let alone enhance, student interests in
tertiary
education.”</p><p><strong>ENDS</strong></p><p><br>
