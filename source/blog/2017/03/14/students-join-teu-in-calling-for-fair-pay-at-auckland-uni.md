<p>STUDENTS JOIN THE
TEU IN CALLING FOR FAIR PAY AT AUCKLAND
UNIVERSITY</p>

<p>Responding to Auckland University Students’
Association’s statement [1] in support of Thursday’s
fair pay strike [2], John Egan, Academic co-president of the
TEU at Auckland University, said:</p>

<p><strong>“We are
delighted the AUSA is joining us in calling on the
Vice-Chancellor to agree to an equal pay increase for all of
our members and to pay the lowest paid staff the Living
Wage. Academic and professional staff at the university work
tirelessly to support students and give them the best
possible learning experience. This includes the lowest paid,
who the Vice-Chancellor is refusing to support by lifting
their pay by an amount equal to everybody
else.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Knowing that their strike action
on Thursday is supported by the students’ association will
mean a great deal to our members. Union members and students
alike recognise how much work we have put in over the last
seven months to reach an agreement with the Vice-Chancellor
that benefits our lowest paid colleagues. That he still
refuses to offer an equal increase in pay speaks volumes
about how little he appreciates the contribution our lowest
paid members make to the student-staff relationship the AUSA
says it values so highly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“We urge the
Vice-Chancellor to take the advice given to him by students
and return to negotiations and agree to our claim for a fair
and equal increase in pay for all of our
members.”</strong></p>
