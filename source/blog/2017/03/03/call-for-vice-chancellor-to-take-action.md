<p>Media release<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa<br>2 March 2017</p>

<p>CALL FOR
VICE-CHANCELLOR TO TAKE ACTION OVER ACESS TO CAMPUS
SPACE</p>

<p>The Tertiary Education Union has joined with AUSA
and other groups urging the vice-chancellor of Auckland
University to step in and reverse a decision that allows a
group promoting white supremacy to spread racist messages as
part of orientation week.<p>

<p>The TEU is among a range
of organisations appalled by a decision of the
university’s Campus Life department to grant the
‘Auckland University European Students' Association’ a
stall in orientation week. Slogans and material posted on
the group's Facebook page strongly point towards an
objective of promoting ‘white pride’.<p>

<p>The
Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) has
expressed its disappointment “that a potentially offensive
group will be permitted to have a presence at the University
of Auckland Orientation, despite serious student concerns of
racist material.”</p>

<p>The decision by the Campus Life
department to grant a stall is something afforded to groups
who have not yet had a chance to affiliate with AUSA.
TEU’s branch committee pointed out that this situation
would not have occurred before the responsibility for
approving stalls at orientation week was removed from AUSA
hands in 2012.</p>

<p>Sandra Grey, TEU national president,
said <strong>“this illustrates the pitfalls of taking
control of student affairs away from students. It is clear
from the imagery used (now removed) on the group’s
Facebook page that these are people that promote white
supremacy. There is no place for a group such as this in the
university community.</strong><p>

<p><strong>“Like the
students' association we respect the importance of free
speech on our campuses, but ‘white pride’ promotes hate
not free speech. On this ground, and for the safety of
others, we urge the university management to step in. This
‘white pride’ group should not be allowed to have space
at the university's Clubs' Expo.”</strong><strong><br>
</strong></p>

<p>The TEU Council, Te Toi Ahurangi, and the
University of Auckland TEU branch will be making
representation to the Vice-Chancellor and Proctor to ask
them to act to ensure the campus remains a safe and tolerant
space.</p>
