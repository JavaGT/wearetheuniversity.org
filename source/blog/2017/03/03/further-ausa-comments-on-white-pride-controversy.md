<p><strong>Further AUSA comments on Auckland University
‘white pride’ controversy</strong></p>

<p>AUSA has been blown
away by the depth of support on this issue.<p>

<p>It has been
so inspiring to see the messages from students, University
staff and members of the public who share student outrage at
the presence of a potentially offensive group forming on our
campus.<p>

<p>This has proved that the spirit of diversity,
tolerance and community is still alive and well in New
Zealand. We need a passionate community who are not afraid
to stand up and call out hatred when we see it, to ensure
that our campuses, our streets and our conversations are
safe.</p>

<p>We have been in contact with the Auckland University
European Students’ Association today. The group claims
that they have been grossly misrepresented. If this is the
case, then we encourage them to constructively engage with
the student community to provide an explanation for how they
have chosen to communicate their values and purpose. We are
sceptical of the possibility that someone could
‘accidentally’ come up with a slogan that evokes Nazi
Germany, and this combined with the other imagery and
iconography that the group has caused many New Zealanders to
draw the same conclusions as Auckland University students.
We encourage AUESA to have this conversation and put our
collective minds to rest.<p>

<p>Again, it has been inspiring to
see the passion and support in our community. Don’t take
this statement to mean that we think there is no more to do
though! AUSA will continue to speak out against intolerance
and hatred on campus, and will continue to encourage the
University of Auckland to join us in ensuring we can learn
and thrive in a safe and welcoming environment.<p>

<p>Kia
kaha</p>
