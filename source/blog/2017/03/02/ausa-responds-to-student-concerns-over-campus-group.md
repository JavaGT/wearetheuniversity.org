<p><strong>STUDENT ASSOCIATION RESPONDS TO CONCERNS OVER CAMPUS
GROUP </strong></p>

<p>Auckland University Students’
Association (AUSA) is disappointed that a potentially
offensive organisation will be permitted to have a presence
at the University of Auckland Orientation, despite serious
student concerns of racist material.</p>

<p>The new organisation,
known as the “Auckland University European Students’
Association” (AUESA) was flagged by a number of students
after representatives of the group appeared on campus, and
the group posted slogans and material on their Facebook page
that is considered typical of nationalist ‘white pride’
and fascist organisations. This includes a slogan ‘our
pride is our honour and loyalty’, which appears similar to
the English translation of the motto of the Nazi SS.</p>

<p>While
all University clubs are required to be affiliated to AUSA
before having an Orientation stall approved, the
University’s Campus Life department granted AUESA a stall
due to a practice of granting spaces at Clubs Expos to
unaffiliated groups that have emerged over the summer break,
during which time the AUSA affiliation process does not
function. Campus Life was not aware of the concern over
AUESA’s potential views and purpose when making this
decision.</p>

<p>On 1st March 2017, AUSA President Will Matthews
met with Campus Life Clubs and Engagement staff, and the
University Proctor to communicate student concerns about the
organization being granted a presence on campus. Despite
these concerns being relayed, it was decided that the AUESA
stall would be permitted to remain at the Clubs Expo on the
basis that while there was ‘potential for offense’, the
organisation had not yet committed any directly offensive
acts.<p>
<p>AUSA respects the importance of free speech at the
University of Auckland, but we share the alarm of students
that this offensive group will be sharing our campus during
Orientation. The University should offer a range of
perspectives and encourage discourse, but our students must
feel safe on campus. The presence of a group that uses such
historically evocative imagery, particularly in a time of
fear and oppression all over the world undermines their
safety. The need for free speech must be balanced with the
importance of having a safe and tolerant campus. There is
also a difference between free speech and hate speech.<p>

<p>The Auckland University European Students’ Association
will be applying to affiliate to AUSA early this year. We
invite all members of the University community to take part
in this decision on whether this group should become part of
the student community. We are confident that we can
facilitate a constructive resolution to this issue.</p>

<p>AUSA
reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that the University of
Auckland is free of hatred and
oppression</p>
