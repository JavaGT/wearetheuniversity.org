<p>PROPOSED JOB CUTS AT WAIKATO UNIVERSITY PROVE NATIONAL'S
TERTIARY EDUCATION EXPERIMENT IS FAILING</p>

<p>Putting 17 people
at risk of losing their jobs and denying students the
opportunity to learn valuable skills in the arts and social
sciences is far too high a price to pay for the government
to continue its failing experiment in market-based
approaches to tertiary education, the Tertiary Education
Union (TEU) said today after Waikato University proposed yet
another shake up of its Faculty of Arts and Social
Sciences.</p>

<p>In a proposal&nbsp;to staff, Acting Dean, Professor
Allison Kirkman, outlined plans to restructure the Faculty
resulting in 17 job losses. Changes also mean that students
will no longer be able to study programmes dedicated to
Women’s and Gender Studies, Labour Studies and Religious
studies. Courses including history, political science,
music, linguistics and geography also face significant
staffing cuts.</p>

<p>Explaining the rationale behind the changes
at a meeting with the TEU, senior management said the
university was no longer willing to cross-subsidise smaller
subject departments, despite posting an overall surplus last
year. The future viability of all subjects, therefore, comes
down to changing market demand, rather than the university
as a whole ensuring the provision of a broad range of
subjects that would give students in the region access to a
variety of learning opportunities. This sort of
market-driven approach to tertiary education threatens the
long-term viability of a wide range of subjects, and is
exactly what Tertiary Education Minister Paul Goldsmith has
proposed in a new law recently introduced to Parliament
[1].<p>

<p>Lars Brabyn, co-president of the TEU branch at
Waikato University and a Senior Lecturer in the School of
Social Science said:&nbsp;“Our members are understandably
worried about these proposals. Losing 17 of our colleagues
will have a huge impact on teaching and we are really
concerned about what it means for the long-term viability of
arts and social science subjects at Waikato
University.</p>

<p><strong>“We recognise this is only a
proposal, but clearly it is the direction senior management
wants the university to head in. We will be doing everything
we can to explain the detrimental impact the proposal&nbsp;will
have, not only on staff but on future generations of
students too. Now more than ever we need graduates of the
arts and social sciences with questioning and curious minds.
If these proposals go through it will be increasingly
unlikely that these minds will come from
Waikato.”</strong></p>

<p>Sandra Grey, TEU national president,
said:&nbsp;“Senior management’s proposal to cut 17 jobs
appears to be based on a rationale of turning the Faculty of
Arts and Social Science into a business, with each subject
thought of as a separate product that must contribute to
overall profitability or be shelved. For a university to
post a surplus one year and cut 17 jobs the next, proves
that the funding model introduced under National is all
wrong.</p>

<p><strong>“</strong>Sadly these changes fit neatly
into National's long-term plan to devalue the social
sciences and humanities; turning education into a commodity
a student should purchase in order to get a job, rather an
opportunity to develop a broad understanding of the world we
live in and the skills needed to change it. It is hugely
disappointing that 17 people’s livelihoods will be another
price we are forced to pay.”</p>
