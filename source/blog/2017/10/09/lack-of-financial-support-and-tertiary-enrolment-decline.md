<p>‘Increasing tertiary education quality is important,
but making it accessible to all is equally vital.  There are
tens of thousands of young people not in education,
employment or training who we need to reach.’</p>

<p>New
Zealand sits at around the OECD average (42%) when it comes
25-34 year olds holding a tertiary qualification (40%). Yet
countries which we typically compare ourselves to have much
higher proportions, such as Australia (49%), the United
Kingdom (50%) and Canada (59%). Gee says this shows that we
can do better when it comes to tertiary education
participation.</p>

<p>‘People around the world have said
that the best anti-poverty programme is education. Tertiary
education results in more stable work, better health over
time, reduced incarceration rates and higher employment.
Greater tertiary education participation is ultimately good
for New Zealand. We can do better.’</p><p>ENDS
