         New Minister must reform tertiary education for the benefit
of all Kiwis</p><p><br>Media release<br>Tertiary Education Union
- Te Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p><strong>Rebuilding the
tertiary education sector into one that benefits us all is
an urgent priority for the new government, and to support
the new Education Minister, Chris Hipkins, deliver the
change we need, the Tertiary Education Union has </strong>today published a briefing<strong> [1]
setting out what reforms must be put in
place.</strong></p><p>Providing a way forward for an accessible
public tertiary education system, the briefing makes a
series of recommendations that will enable the new Minister
to reverse years of National’s under funding, ensure our
communities have access to quality learning opportunities,
change the rules so staff and students have a voice in
workplace decisions, increase student support and improve
pay and conditions.</p><p>Sandra Grey, national president of the
Tertiary Education Union, said: <strong>“The change of
government has brought hope for the future of our sector and
the thousands of dedicated staff that work tirelessly to
give our students the best possible learning experience.
However, now is not the time to sit back and let the
government get on with it.</strong></p><p><strong>“We must
hold them to their promises and work hard to ensure they
deliver the change we need for an accessible, fully-funded
public tertiary education system that supports staff and
student well-being. The recommendations we have published
today set out a plan for exactly this. They are the ideas
staff want to see the new Education Minister Chris Hipkins
and his team put in place to improve tertiary education for
the benefit of us all.”</strong>

<p>Recommendations in the
TEU’s briefing include the following, some of which could
be implemented in Chris Hipkins’ first 100 days, and
others that can be put in place over the remainder of the
three-year parliamentary term:</p><p>• Scrap National’s
damaging Education Amendment Bill immediately, and over the
next three years ditching the competitive model and student
achievement component of funding and replacing it with
planned and managed funding</p><p>• Restore a strong staff,
student, and community voice to university, wānanga, and
polytechnic councils</p><p>• End the obsession with narrow
performance metrics so teaching, research and learning is
understood as more than completions and international
journal articles</p><p>• Immediately increase student
allowances by at least $50 per week, and by the end of the
Parliamentary terms make sure all students receive the same
accommodation allowance afforded others receiving
benefits</p><p>The TEU has written to the new Minister
requesting a meeting at the earliest opportunity to discuss
these recommendations in
full.</p><p><strong>--ENDS—</strong></p><p><strong>Notes to
