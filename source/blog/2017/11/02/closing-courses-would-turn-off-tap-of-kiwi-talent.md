         Closing internationally recognised courses would turn off
tap of Kiwi talent </p><p></p><p><br>Plans announced by University
of Otago management this week to shut down New Zealand’s
only comprehensive bachelors to doctorate degree
qualification in clothing and textiles science would
severely undermine a valuable sector that draws world class
talent to Otago, the Tertiary Education Union
said.</p><p>Learning and research opportunities at the Centre of
Materials Science and Technology attract students from all
over New Zealand and other parts of the world. Graduates of
the Centre are employed in a wide range of jobs, with many
snapped up by employers for jobs before they have even
completed their studies, such is the Centre’s reputation.
Postgraduate enrolments have also increased steadily over
the last 5 years in parallel with ongoing curriculum
developments.</p><p>Management is allowing only two weeks for
staff, industry and the local community to provide feedback
on the Centre’s closure. It is unrealistic to expect all
affected stakeholders to have their say in this short
timeframe, including all those businesses and public sector
organisations that may no longer be able to employ New
Zealand educated graduates.</p><p>Kris Smith, an organiser of
the TEU’s branch at the University of Otago, said: “The
loss of these internationally recognised learning
opportunities would be a disaster. No longer would future
generations with an interest in the science and cultural
impact of fibres, textiles and clothing look to the
University of Otago as the path towards a fulfilling career
in a wide range of sectors. New Zealand would also lose
research capabilities in these hugely important
fields.</p><p>“Management cannot possibly expect to speak to
all affected stakeholders in the two weeks it is allowing
for feedback. They would be wise to extend the consultation
period to allow enough time for staff and industry to get
around the table to work out a plan for the Centre’s
future. Perhaps then management will hear just how important
these qualifications are to New
Zealand.”</p><p>--ENDS--
