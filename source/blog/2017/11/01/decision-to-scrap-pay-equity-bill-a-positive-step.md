         Decision to scrap National’s flawed pay equity bill a
positive step </p><p>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū
Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p>The new government has moved quickly
to scrap National’s flawed Equal Pay and Pay Equity Bill,
a decision that was welcomed by the Tertiary Education Union
as a positive step towards making sure women are paid fairly
for the work they do.</p><p>All three government parties opposed
the Bill in the last Parliament and today the Minister for
Workplace Relations and Safety Iain Lees-Galloway and the
Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter confirmed it would be
thrown out.</p><p>The Bill was introduced by National shortly
before the election and would have put serious obstacles in
the way of women making claims to achieve genuine equal pay.
It also failed to fully incorporate the pay equity
Principles a Joint Working Group of government, business and
unions agreed last year.</p><p>Suzanne McNabb, the TEU’s
national women’s officer, said: “We congratulate the
government on taking action so promptly on their commitment
to equal pay for work of equal value. National introduced
the Bill knowing it would make it more difficult for women
to achieve equal pay and ever since working people have been
standing together to demand better. Today’s announcement
gives us hope that genuine equal pay can be achieved under
this government, including for all women working in tertiary
education.</p><p>“Scrapping the Bill must not be seen as the
end game. However, it was always a necessary first step for
the new government to take in order to deliver on its
commitment to genuine equal pay. We look forward to
supporting all three parties in making the changes required
so women are valued equally in the workplace, and to using
the networks we are part of to provide a strong independent
voice supporting those changes, where
possible.”</p><p>--ENDS--
