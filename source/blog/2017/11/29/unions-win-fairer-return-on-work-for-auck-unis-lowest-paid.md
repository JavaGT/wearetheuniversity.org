         Unions win fairer return on work for Auckland Uni’s lowest
paid</p><p>Some of the lowest paid people at the University of
Auckland can now look forward to a fairer return on their
work from next year, thanks to Tertiary Education Union
members (TEU) who have negotiated collectively for a
significant boost in pay for their lower paid
colleagues.</p><p>The proposed two year settlement [1] will see
pay increase by up to 4 percent in each year for those
earning less than $40,000, meaning the lowest paid would
receive a return on work that more accurately reflects the
time, energy and commitment they give to the university.
Members of the TEU and Public Service Association have been
meeting this week to discuss the proposed settlement and to
vote on whether it should be put to a ballot [2].</p><p>From
February next year, eight of the 200 people working at the
university who are currently paid less than $40,000 would
see their pay increase to $40,000 or more per annum - rising
to 70 people in 2019. This will mean people who do so much
to make studying at Auckland possible can now look forward
to taking home more to help meet the city’s rising living
costs and to provide for their families.</p><p>Enzo Giordani,
lead advocate for the unions at the University of Auckland
and one of the organisers of the Tertiary Education Union
branch, said: “People who work so hard to make the
University of Auckland a great place to work and study
deserve to make a decent living. It is thanks to our members
coming together over the last year that we have ensured the
lowest paid people working at the university receive a
fairer return on their work.

<p>“We have been talking to
our members this week about what the proposed settlement
would mean for them and their colleagues, many of whom can
now look forward to earning enough to make ends meet in an
increasingly expensive city, to provide for their families
and whānau, or to have a little extra so they can do more
fun things together at the weekend.</p><p>“At moments like
this, where we have shown the collective strength of unions,
it is important also to recognise the Vice-Chancellor for
working with us and for addressing our members’ efforts to
ensure people working at the university are paid enough to
reach an acceptable, if modest, standard of
living.”</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>1. The proposed settlement
includes the following:</p><p>A two-year term<br>A 1.4% pay
increase on 1 February 2018 for all staff paid $40,000 or
more per annum and a minimum 1.6% pay increase from 1
February 2019, or the university's across the board
increase, whichever is greater)<br>A pay increase of up to
4% on 1 February 2018 for all staff paid less than $40,000
per annum, with a further pay increase of up to 4% on 1
February 2019 (for those still paid less than $40,000 per
annum).<br>2. The Tertiary Education Union and Public
Service Association are party to the Collective Agreement at
the University of Auckland. Both unions were represented on
the team that negotiated successfully for the proposed
settlement.</p><p>--ENDS--<!-- LINKS REMOVED
