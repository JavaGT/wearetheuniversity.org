<p><br>In the previous
Government’s Budget 2017 they announced an increase in the
students’ Accommodation Benefit of up to $20 (making it a
maximum of $60 from April 2018). The Accommodation
Supplement increased by an average of $36 (making it a
maximum of $165 from April 2018).</p>

<p><br>‘From 2018
students will still be up to $100 worse off than
beneficiaries with respect to accommodation
support.’</p>

<p><br>‘Let’s see the $50 increase in student
support for what it is - an increase to meet basic needs.
Any suggestion that it will create a rort is totally
refutable.’</p>
