	 <p>
         26 November 2017</p><p><br><strong>Fact check: Student Allowance
increase is not a rort</strong><strong></strong></p><p><br>The
National Party’s claims that the Student Allowance
increase will be easy money for the unemployed are
incorrect, says the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations (NZUSA).</p><p><br>Responding to news first
published in the <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nzherald.co.nz%2Fnz%2Fnews%2Farticle.cfm%3Fc_id%3D1%26objectid%3D11947890&amp;e=4236cfde8d142a4e913140d100895c4855638393&amp;utm_source=students&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=factcheck1&amp;n=1" target="_blank">NZ Herald</a> today, National President
Jonathan Gee says: ‘Simply comparing the Student Allowance
figure with Jobseeker Support does not show the whole
picture.’</p><p><br>The claims do not take into account the
Accommodation Supplement of up to $130 per week. The
Supplement is accessible to most beneficiaries, except
students, who need accommodation support on top of their
current benefit.</p><p><br>Instead, students can access the
Accommodation Benefit of up to $40 to top up their
Allowance, a stark contrast to the $130 for
non-students.</p><p><br>‘In fact, students who have been on
other benefits have told us that going into tertiary study
has been a big financial sacrifice for them and their
families.’</p><p><br>Gee also dismissed claims that suggested
the previous Government aimed to give the same money to
students as well as other beneficiaries.</p><p><br>‘While the
previous Government claimed they pegged the Student
Allowance to the Jobseeker benefit, they pledged greater
increases to the Accommodation Supplement compared with the
Accommodation Benefit for students.’

</div></div>
<p><br>In the previous
Government’s Budget 2017 they announced an increase in the
students’ Accommodation Benefit of up to $20 (making it a
maximum of $60 from April 2018). The Accommodation
Supplement increased by an average of $36 (making it a
maximum of $165 from April 2018).</p><p><br>‘From 2018
students will still be up to $100 worse off than
beneficiaries with respect to accommodation
support.’</p><p><br>‘Let’s see the $50 increase in student
support for what it is - an increase to meet basic needs.
Any suggestion that it will create a rort is totally
refutable.’</p><p><br>ENDS</p><p><br>
