         <strong>Students say New Zealand needs
humanities</strong></p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’
Association (NZUSA) today stands in solidarity with the
Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and the thousands of New
Zealanders showing their love and support for
humanities.</p><p>Today, 22 February, is the TEU’s Love
Humanities national day-of-action to protest continued cuts
and underfunding and highlight the importance of the
humanities to society.</p><p>Government underfunding has placed
significant pressure on humanities subjects, which has led
to cuts to programmes across all eight of New Zealand’s
universities.</p><p>“Humanities are a core aspect of our
tertiary education institutions and students’ academic
experience,” says Jonathan Gee, National President of
NZUSA.</p><p>“Without these subjects, which encourage students
to understand society and culture, we are undermining the
ability of institutions to be the critic and conscience of
society.”</p><p>“Humanities subjects teach students the
vital skills of communication, collaboration, creativity and
critical thinking, and are a crucial in preparing students
to be globally competent and having the tools to engage
globally.”</p><p>Languages have been particularly hard-hit by
a lack of funding. Since 2008, there has been a drop in over
one thousand enrolments in foreign language programmes, or
nearly a third, mostly at bachelors-level. </p><p>“The
government must reprioritise support for language programmes
if it wants New Zealand to continue to compete and engage
globally. With little more than 100 students undertaking
postgraduate study in languages in 2015, New Zealand risks
falling behind.”</p><p>Events are taking place across the New
Zealand to celebrate humanities, including a 'teach-in' at
the University of Otago and a public forum on the Value of
Humanities at Victoria University of Wellington this
evening.</p><p>ENDS</p><p><br>
