<p>The wait continues for some Waipapa Taumata Rau |
University of Auckland students who have still not received
their final grades as academic staff who are members of Te
Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union extend their
strike again.</p>

<p>The strike, a ban on entering and
releasing student marks or course marks into any student
management system, first commenced at 7pm on Monday 14
November and is now due to end at 11:59pm on Monday 5
December.</p>

<p>In an email to staff late yesterday
afternoon, Vice Chancellor Dawn Freshwater wrote “The
cumulative effect of this strike action has created a large
backlog of work that the University is, and has been,
addressing as an urgent priority. It has also had an
extraordinarily damaging impact on many of our students,
raising concerns about entry into limited access courses for
2023; securing offers to study at universities overseas; and
securing offers of employment. Many of our international
students also need confirmation of their grades to secure
their student visas.”</p>

<p>TEU Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser
Nicole Wallace says “we don’t want this action to
continue to impact students and we’re disappointed that
the Vice-Chancellor did not respond to the TEU offer to
withdraw the previous strike notice if she withdrew the
employer proposal to remove valuable employment conditions
for future staff.”</p>

<p>“Dawn Freshwater appears to be
shifting the blame to TEU members for a problem entirely of
her making. She can end the strike today by instructing her
negotiating team to stop trying to force our members to
betray future colleagues by removing terms and conditions of
employment in exchange for an effective pay cut for current
staff.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a group of University of Auckland
students started
a petition on Wednesday, in support of staff strike
action, which has already attracted over 500
signatures.</p><p>
