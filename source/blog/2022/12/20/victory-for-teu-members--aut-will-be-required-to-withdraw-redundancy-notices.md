         </p><p>Te Ratonga Ahumana Taimahi | The Employment Relations
Authority has ruled in Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union’s favour in legal action against Te
Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki Makau Rau | Auckland University of
Technology.</p><p>The Authority determined that AUT breached
the collective agreement and will be required to withdraw
redundancy notices issued to as many as 80 staff a fortnight
ago or face a compliance order.</p><p>Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Jill Jones says “our members are relieved by the
decision. It’s been an arduous and distressing few months
as we work our way through this, so it’s nice to have some
good news for them a week out from
Christmas.”</p><p>“However, I must say it is sad that
it’s taken a legal battle for AUT to do what we have been
trying to tell them they had to do from the outset. We hope
their leadership team will learn from this and engage with
us fully and properly from the beginning in
future.”</p><p>The determination states that AUT was
obliged to identify positions that “could be determined as
surplus” before applying selection criteria, that this
didn’t happen, and that it’s now “necessary and just
that AUT should be asked to go back and follow the CEA
correctly”. The Authority also found that the calls for
voluntary severance were not made as intended and required
by the collective agreement.</p><p>The
full Employment Relations Authority determination can be
