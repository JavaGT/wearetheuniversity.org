	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
three of Aotearoa’s eight universities have voted to
ratify new collective agreements that deliver real gains for
many lower paid workers.</p><p>Months of negotiating and
campaigning by thousands of union members at Te Whare
Wānanga o Ōtākou | University of Otago, Te Whare Wānanga
o Waitaha | University of Canterbury and Te Herenga Waka |
Victoria University of Wellington paid off with
significantly better outcomes than those initially proposed
by employers.</p><p>TEU Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser at
University of Canterbury Gabrielle Moore says “for some
general (non-academic) staff at Canterbury we have delivered
pay increases between 10.1% and 17.9% over the term of the
agreement.”</p><p>However, as Te Pou Ahurei | National
Secretary Sandra Grey is quick to point out, these outcomes
do not signal that the pressure is now off Vice Chancellors
or the government.</p><p>“These deals have delivered some
positive outcomes and 7,000 of our members at the eight
universities deserve all the credit for that because this
wouldn’t have been possible without the brave stand they
have and are continuing to make. However these settlements
still leave most academic staff at Otago, Victoria, and
Canterbury universities behind what they deserve and there
are still five universities that have not reached
settlements.”</p><p>“Strike action is ongoing at
University of Auckland and for them, along with Massey
University, Waikato University, Lincoln University, and AUT,
negotiations are likely to continue into the new year with
the possibility further strikes remaining firmly on the
table.”</p>

<p>“As I said last week, the wide variation
in offers to different groups of union members at different
universities continues to illustrate why we urgently need
tripartite talks between the university Vice Chancellors,
the government, and TEU to address the issue of staff pay in
the sector with a national approach. And why we will
continue to stand together, work together, and make
decisions
collectively.</p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
