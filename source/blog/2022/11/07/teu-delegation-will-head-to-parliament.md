         </p><p>A delegation of Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education
Union members will head to the grounds of Parliament a
little before midday on Tuesday 8 November seeking
government support for quality tertiary
education.</p><p>Following some brief speeches to those
assembled, Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra Grey
will present an open letter
on university pay addressed to Prime Minister Jacinda
Ardern, and a
petition on Te Pūkenga funding. Both will be accepted
on behalf of the government by Labour MP Deborah
Russell.</p><p>The letter asks for urgent government
intervention on the current university pay dispute, while
the petition asks the Ministers of Finance and Education to
boost vocational education funding in order to avoid course
cuts.</p><p>Sandra Grey says “it’s long past time for
the government to step up and take its share of
responsibility for the issues facing tertiary education.
They can’t keep saying they’ve increased funding when in
real terms they have not, and they can’t keep saying
negotiations around pay are simply matters between employers
and their unions when the government has ultimate oversight
and controls funding of the sector.”</p><p>“Our members
would rather be working with learners than taking strike
action or having to come directly to the steps of
Parliament. But our calls for talks around the sector
between employers, the government, and TEU have not been
agreed to.”</p>

<p>“We have continually highlighted
significant issues caused by inadequate funding and a broken
funding model across the sector – in universities,
polytechnics and wānanga – that are not being addressed.
If the government won’t step in, then strike action which
has been going on for a month is likely to continue into
election year.”</p><p>TEU university members voted
overwhelming for strike action – including stoppages and
not entering grades. The rally begins at 11:50am on
Parliament’s
lawn.</p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
