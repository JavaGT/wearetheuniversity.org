<p>Professional (non-academic) staff at The University of
Auckland | Waipapa Taumata Rau who are members of Te Hautū
Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union have commenced a
week-long strike.</p>

<p>The strike is a ban on working more
than the ordinary hours of work defined in the collective
agreement from 8:30 this morning until 5pm on Thursday 24
November. This strike is in addition to a ban on entering
and releasing student marks or course marks into any student
management system that commenced at 7pm on Monday.</p>

<p>TEU
Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Adam Craigie says “our members
are only contracted and paid to work 37.5 hours per week,
yet this is rarely adhered to, if ever. This strike will
shine a light on an important underlying issue in the
current dispute.”</p>

<p>“Universities function on an
enormous amount of goodwill. In the aftermath of over a
decade of restructuring that has seen hundreds of staff
leave but the work they did remaining, our members have been
struggling to do more and more on top of the full-time jobs
they already had. Then COVID-19 hit and significantly
increased workloads again.”</p>

<p>“This has left them at
and beyond breaking point with little real empathy from
senior management who are now telling them they are not
worth a pay rise that keeps the value of their pay up with
inflation when that is the minimum they
deserve.”</p>

<p>“Enough is
enough.”</p>
