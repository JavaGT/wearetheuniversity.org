<p>Te Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki Makau Rau | Auckland
University of Technology has released fresh change proposals
that, if confirmed, will see a further 36 job losses – all
allied (non-academic) staff – with more expected in the
new year.</p>

<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education
Union Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Jill Jones says “while
this latest tranche of proposed job cuts is not unexpected,
it remains bitterly disappointing. Vice Chancellor Damon
Salesa is continuing to acquiesce to outdated and senseless
management thinking.”</p>

<p>“We know that the most
effective way to frustrate students and put them off
studying at an institution is to cut allied staff. These are
the people students often go to when they have questions or
need help. Allied staff are a big part of what makes or
breaks the student experience. How does AUT expect to make
their so-called “financial recovery” by continuing to
alienate their most important revenue
source?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, AUT students have launched a
petition that aims to “reinstate AUT academic staff who
have been made redundant based on unjust and flawed
performance criteria.”</p>

<p>A letter to the Vice
Chancellor, attached to the petition, states:
“Redundancies of AUT staff has and will negatively impact
our study progress and quality, our mental health, and our
motivation to continue our careers at
AUT.”</p>
