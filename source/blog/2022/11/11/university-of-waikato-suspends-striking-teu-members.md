         </p><p>Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato | University of Waikato has
advised Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union
members covered by today’s strike notice, in an email to
staff sent after 6:30pm last night, that they will be issued
with suspension notices applicable for the duration of the
strike notice.</p><p>The strike is a three-day ban on
entering and releasing student marks or course marks into
any student management system commencing at 7am on Friday
November 11 and due to end at 5pm on Tuesday November
15.</p><p>TEU Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Shane Vugler says
the strike will go ahead. “This is an aggressive move by
the Vice Chancellor, to suspend striking staff for three
days with no pay for a strike that would have only seen our
members refuse to undertake a small part of their job.
Instead they are now forced to withdraw all of their labour.
Tactics such as these are rarely seen in the public
sector.”</p><p>“Overnight, members have been expressing
their shock and anger at this move.”</p><p>“What makes
this even more outrageous is the sheer volume of additional
hours our members have been working in recent times, which
far outweigh the time they would have spent participating in
this strike. Actions such as this might be designed to break
our members but instead it will strengthen their resolve to
continue pushing for a real pay
rise.”</p>
