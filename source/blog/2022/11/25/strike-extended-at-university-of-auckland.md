<p>Waipapa Taumata Rau | University of Auckland students
waiting for final grades may have to wait longer as academic
staff who are members of Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union extend their strike for another
week.</p>

<p>The strike is a ban on entering and releasing
student marks or course marks into any student management
system, which first commenced at 7pm on Monday 14 November
and is now due to end at 5pm on Thursday 1
December.</p>

<p>TEU Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Adam Craigie
says “as we’ve previously stated, we understand that
this action will cause inconvenience to students, and our
members would much rather be meeting student needs than
taking strike action, but we have been left with no choice
by an employer that refuses to budge from their unacceptable
position.”</p>

<p>“The choice rests entirely with the
Vice Chancellor. She should instruct her negotiating team to
return to the table with an offer that delivers a fair pay
rise without removal of conditions for future staff so that
everyone can return our full focus to serving
students.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the grinch who stole Christmas
made a brief appearance at a lunchtime rally outside the
University of Auckland Clocktower yesterday to present TEU
members with a bag of coal to symbolise the poor treatment
of staff by the employer as we head into December.</p>

<p>In
response, Adam Craigie said “our members are tired of
being treated like they are on Santa’s naughty list.
It’s time for the employer to stop being a grinch, start
listening to us and properly recognise staff for all the
great work they do.”</p>

<p>The professional (non-academic)
staff strikes, which were a ban on entering and releasing
student marks or course marks into any student management
system and a ban on working more than the ordinary hours of
work defined in the collective agreement, have concluded. It
is hoped that this show of goodwill from TEU members will
result in a return to the negotiation
table.</p>
