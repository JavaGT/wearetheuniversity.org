           <h1>University Of Auckland Staff Will Strike Tomorrow</h1>

           <span class="byline"><b>Monday, 14 November 2022,  9:42 am</b><br>
             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Tertiary_Education_Union">Tertiary Education Union</a></b></span>

	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
Waipapa Taumata Rau | University of Auckland will begin a
ban on entering and releasing student marks or course marks
into any student management system at 7pm tonight.</p><p>TEU
Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Adam Craigie says “the strike is
a result of continuing frustration and anger from members
that the employer is not moving from their inadequate pay
offer and they continue to insist that their best offer is
contingent on removing important conditions such as
retirement leave from the collective
agreement.”</p><p>“We understand that this action will
cause inconvenience to students, which is something we
don’t do lightly, however we have been forced into this by
an employer that refuses to listen to staff repeatedly
saying they are past breaking point.”</p><p>“Staff
working conditions are student learning conditions. Without
pay that keeps pace with inflation, good staff will leave
for other industries and overseas universities that value
staff properly.”</p><p>“We urge the Vice Chancellor and
her negotiation team to improve their offer so we can all
get back to focussing 100% on what we love – teaching and
research.”</p><p>TEU members will also rally outside the
University of Auckland Clock Tower on Princes Street at noon
today.</p><p>The strike notice ends at 7pm on Friday 18
November.</p>
