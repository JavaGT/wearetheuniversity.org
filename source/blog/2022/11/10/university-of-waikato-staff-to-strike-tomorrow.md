           <h1>University Of Waikato Staff To Strike Tomorrow</h1>

           <span class="byline"><b>Thursday, 10 November 2022,  2:48 pm</b><br>
             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Tertiary_Education_Union">Tertiary Education Union</a></b></span>

         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato | University of Waikato will
begin a three-day ban on entering and releasing student
marks or course marks into any student management system
tomorrow morning.</p><p>TEU Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Shane
Vugler says “staff at University of Waikato have been
working extremely hard for a long time – but doubly so
since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. But on top of all the extra
work and long hours this has necessitated, the university
now expects our members to accept a 2% pay increase that is
well below inflation.”</p><p>“The Vice Chancellors are
all saying they can’t afford real pay rises for staff and
yet, at Waikato for example, the university is spending $100
million on new buildings, including a suite of executive
offices that will house senior management and the University
Council.”</p><p>“Our members are angry and frustrated
that the university is prioritising buildings and flash
executive offices and at the same time are unwilling to come
to the table with an acceptable pay offer. They are prepared
to keep taking strike action until this changes."</p><p>The
strike will commence at 7am on Friday November 11 and end at
5pm on Tuesday November
15.</p>
