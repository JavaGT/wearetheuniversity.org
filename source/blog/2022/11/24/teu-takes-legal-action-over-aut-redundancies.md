<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is taking
legal action against AUT that it hopes will curtail plans to
make 170 staff members redundant.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Jill Jones says “TEU’s preference is to
resolve issues such as this without legal action but the
union has been left with no option, due in part to Vice
Chancellor Damon Salesa’s ongoing refusal to meaningfully
engage with staff kanohi ki te kanohi | face to
face.”</p>

<p>“AUT is truncating the processes set out in
the collective agreement and is picking people to dismiss
because they have not met teaching and research requirements
they did not know they had to meet until it was too
late.”</p>

<p>“During the Covid lockdowns, AUT managers
had told staff to concentrate on the welfare of their
students and putting courses online
rapidly.”</p>

<p>“Now, as a redundancy criterion, AUT
have decided that if some staff did not produce a certain
number or type of research outputs during that time, or meet
arbitrary teaching requirements, they will lose their
jobs.”</p>

<p>“There is still time for the employer to do
the right thing here and avoid the expense and disruption of
a legal fight. The Vice Chancellor should front up, withdraw
his proposal, and talk to the TEU about more constructive
ways to make AUT a great university without breaching the
collective
agreement.”</p><p>
