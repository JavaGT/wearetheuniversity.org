<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
    believes that today’s speech by the Prime Minister
    celebrating a $25 increase to the Student Allowance
    demonstrates how disconnected the Government is from the
    hardship that the 400,000 students across Aotearoa are
    currently experiencing.</p>
<p>NZUSA, Te Mana Ākonga, Tauira
    Pasifika, the National Disabled Students’ Association and
    50 other student organisations have been calling for a
    Universal Education Income to help students reengage in
    their education post-Covid. This ask was included in the
    National Student Action Plan on COVID-19 but has gone
    unheard.</p>
<p>“Ignoring the Universal Education Income
    proposal while increasing allowances by an amount that
    doesn’t even match the rent hikes that most students have
    seen is a slap in the face” says NZUSA National President
    Andrew Lessells. “Add into the equation that most students
    aren’t even eligible for the full student allowance,
    celebrating this token gesture just seems callous when
    students are dropping out because they can’t afford to
    live.”</p>
<p>The speech from the Prime Minister came as
    the Government increases a variety of income and welfare
    supports on 1 April as inflation tracks at 5.9%. “These
    changes were announced before we hit crisis point, and it
    shows. The fact that the Government hasn’t adapted to the
    new reality shows how utterly disconnected they are” says
    Lessells.</p>
<p>Students feel that this increase is yet
    another example of the Government tinkering around the edges
    when there is a fundamental flaw with the way StudyLink
    works. Lessells says that “a system that expects postgrad
    and mature students to live on food parcels is fundamentally
    wrong. The cost-of-living crisis that students are currently
    experiencing offers a fantastic opportunity to change how we
    support students.”</p>

<p>He added, “now is the right
    time to move away from a discriminatory and ineffective
    system towards a Universal Education Income that makes sure
    all students can afford learn, regardless of their age,
    where they live or what they study.”</p>
<p>“While the
    introduction of a universal allowance would be bold,
    students need bold action to survive. A revolutionary moment
    in the world's history is a time for revolutions, not for
    patching. We’re disappointed that the Government hasn’t
    recognised this.”</p>
<p>NZUSA has conducted initial
    research on the costs of implementing a Universal Education
    income that can be read here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
