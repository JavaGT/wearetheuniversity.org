<p>Shortages of nursing and social work staff in Aotearoa
can only be met with strong training
programmes.</p>

<p>However, current moves to consolidate the
curriculum in the new network of vocational education
provision – Te Pūkenga - will fall short of delivering
strong and adept workforces in nursing and social work
according to Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union
members.</p>

<p>TEU members have repeatedly called on the
leaders of Te Pūkenga to give them more time and to ensure
strong staff-driven process to deliver quality, workable and
consolidated curriculum in nursing and social work. These
two areas of teaching and learning have been the first
targeted for consolidation in processes that have been
rushed and left staff feeling disrespected and not listened
to.</p>

<p>The union is now launching a petition to all
working in tertiary education, nursing, and social work to
help deliver their message to the leaders of the new
vocational education network.</p>

<p>Te Pūkenga gave nurse
tutors and the nursing community only 11 days to review and
comment.</p>

<p>TEU National President Tina Smith says “the
first versions of the Te Pūkenga consolidated curriculum
out for consultation are missing critical components and the
timeline of implementation is unrealistic. The nursing
curriculum proposed has no immunisation modules for example,
and in social work they’ve removed modules for teaching
students the needed skills to work with refugee and migrant
communities.”</p>

<p>“All we’ve asked for is some more
time so that staff in the tertiary education sector, who
know the value of working together, can ensure the best
learning outcomes for all
akonga.</p>
