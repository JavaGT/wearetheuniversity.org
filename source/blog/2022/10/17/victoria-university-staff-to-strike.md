<p>Te Whare Wānaka O Aoraki | Lincoln University staff will
strike for half a day on Thursday as Te Hautū Kahurangi |
Tertiary Education Union’s campaign for a real pay rise in
the university sector rolls on.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Thad Hadaway says “salaries at Lincoln are
amongst the lowest in the Aotearoa university sector. As a
result, our members are acutely aware of the rapidly rising
cost of living and particularly keen to speak out and
participate in further action in this national
campaign.”</p>

<p>At a recent all staff briefing, when
questioned about the possibility of an 8% pay increase, Vice
Chancellor Grant Edwards said he believes “it's a total
package of what we offer here at Lincoln University which
includes salary but it also includes the other key aspects
of working in a wonderful environment with great colleagues,
working in a place where we are establishing outstanding
research, education, and service careers…”</p>

<p>Thad
Hadaway says “While Lincoln is scenic place to work, such
pastoral landscapes don't assist in making ends meet when
the cost of living is so high.”</p>

<p>TEU members will
gather at the Viewing Gallery in the Rec Centre for a rally
at 1pm on Thursday 13 October and strike until
5pm.</p><p>
