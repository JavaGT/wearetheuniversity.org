<p>Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa | Massey University staff will
strike for two hours from 10am to 12pm on Wednesday as Te
Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union continues to
agitate for real pay rises across the tertiary education
sector.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Lawrence
O’Halloran says “the university’s current pay offer is
simply not good enough in the face of the cost-of-living
crisis our members are grappling with. Massy staff are
striking because they continue to feel overworked and
underappreciated. It’s time for Jan Thomas to listen or
continue to face disruptions.”</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei |
National Secretary Sandra Grey adds “as chair of Te Pōkai
Tara | Universities New Zealand, Jan Thomas also carries a
wider responsibility in this dispute. We have repeatedly
offered both the Vice Chancellors and Chancellors a
potential solution to a shared problem of deeply upset
staff, that could reduce the employers’ need to pay for a
real pay rise out of current funding. But so far university
management across the sector appear to prefer unhappy
students and staff to working with us, which says a lot
about their ideology.”</p>

<p>TEU members at Massey
University will gather for rallies at 10am on Wednesday 19
October at the following locations:</p>

<p>Albany: Main
Entrance of The Atrium</p>

<p>Wellington: Main entrance (the
Glass Pyramid)</p>

<p>Manawatu:
Concourse</p>
