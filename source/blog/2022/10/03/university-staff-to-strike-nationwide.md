	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members,
along with colleagues from PSA and E Tū, have voted
overwhelmingly to strike at all eight of Aotearoa’s
universities. The vote followed a series of paid stop work
meetings twelve days ago, where members
present almost unanimously called for strike
ballots.</p><p>As a result, plans are underway for union
members to strike this week at University of Auckland, AUT,
University of Waikato, Massey University, Victoria
University of Wellington, Canterbury University, Lincoln
University and University of Otago.</p><p>The unions are
claiming an 8% pay increase to match the rising cost of
living.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei Takirua – Ahumahi | Assistant
National Secretary – Industrial, Irena Brörens says
“our members are feeling frustrated, angry, and worried
about the future of their sector if pay does not keep pace
with the cost of living. They don’t want to keep watching
good colleagues leave tertiary education or move overseas
for industries and international universities that value
staff more fairly for what they do.”</p><p>“The message
we’ve heard loud and clear from our members up and down
Aotearoa is they find their employers’ pay offers
unacceptable, they are feeling undervalued and they are not
willing to accept an effective pay cut. They are taking
action for each of their collective agreements, as a sector
and as a union to show tertiary employers how serious they
are.”</p>

<p>Te Pūkenga Here Tikanga Mahi | Public Service
Association Assistant Secretary Alex Davies said it was
disappointing that members have been forced into taking
strike action.</p><p>“The overwhelming vote to strike just
underlines the strength of feeling among our members who
feel a cost of living adjustment is simply fair and
reasonable at a time of unprecedented pressure on household
budgets. We hope our action sends a strong message to
university employers that they need to invest in their staff
before it's too late.”</p><p>A further media release will
be issued later this week when the strikes are
finalised.</p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
