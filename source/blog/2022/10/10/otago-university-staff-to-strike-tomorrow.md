<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union’s
campaign for a real pay rise in the university sector
continues tomorrow, when approximately 1,000 union members
at Te Whare Wānanga o Ōtākou | The University of Otago
will strike for two hours from 12:30 until
2:30pm.</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | branch organiser Phil Edwards
says “while we were disappointed not to be able to rally
last week due to snow in Dunedin, we always knew this
campaign was not a ‘one-hit-wonder’ and there would be
further opportunities for our members to make their voices
heard.”</p>

<p>“University of Otago staff have been
struggling with the rapidly rising cost of living, on top of
the stress and demands of COVID and recent low pay
settlements, just like our colleagues up and down
Aotearoa.”</p>

<p>“It’s time for our employer and the
government to listen.”</p>

<p>Last week, Prime Minister
Jacinda Ardern weighed
in on the TEU strikes, saying “this is obviously
something the universities are dealing directly with their
unions on. We have increased the subsidy rate from central
government in order to support universities with their
additional costs, but ultimately when it comes to
negotiations of this nature it is up to the two
parties.”</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary of the
TEU Sandra Grey says this response is not good enough. “We
have been repeatedly
seeking tripartite talks between the minister, the
universities and our union to talk about the underinvestment
in people throughout our sector. It is a matter for the
government when a sector they carry the ultimate
responsibility and oversight for is not treating its people
well.”</p>

<p>Members will meet for a rally at the
University Union Lawn at University of Otago’s main campus
at 12:30
tomorrow.</p>
