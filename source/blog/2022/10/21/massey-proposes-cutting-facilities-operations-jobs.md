           <h1>Massey Proposes Cutting Facilities, Operations Jobs</h1>

         </p><p>TEU members are devastated by Massey University’s
proposal to cut as many as 72 jobs and restructure
University staff across facilities management, operations,
and sustainability departments.</p><p>The proposal would cut
or change the jobs of many long serving staff working across
campuses. Positions ranging from maintenance workers to
administrators and other staff are all proposed to be
cut.</p><p>TEU Organiser Ben Schmidt says “Members are
stunned. The proposed changes show a complete lack of
understanding and respect for their crucial work. These
staff are essential to maintaining safe and thriving
campuses.”</p><p>In addition to redundancies, the proposed
changes would see already overworked and under-resourced
staff stretched even further. Union members have raised
serious concerns about the potential health and safety
implications of any further increases to workloads without
better resourcing.</p><p>Schmidt says that “The Massey
Vice-Chancellor Jan Thomas needs to front up and listen to
staff, stop cutting jobs, and instead work to fully resource
and support the essential work of these invaluable
staff.”</p>
