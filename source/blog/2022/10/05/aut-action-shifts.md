<p>Yesterday afternoon, Te Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki Makau
Rau | Auckland University of Technology, in a communication
to all staff, advised that Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union members covered by yesterday’s strike
notice would be issued with suspension notices applicable
for the duration of the strike.</p>

<p>The strike at AUT was
a ban on entering or releasing student marks or course marks
into the AUT student management system from 8am on 6 October
until 5pm on 21 October. AUT confirmed that they intended to
not pay our members for two weeks.</p>

<p>As a result, TEU
has withdrawn the previous strike notices at AUT and issued
a new one for a four-hour stoppage from 1pm until 5pm
tomorrow, 6 October. The previously announced 12pm rally
will go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>TEU has been advised that
AUT will not take action to suspend, and members’ pay will
be unaffected during the strike on
Thursday.</p><p>
