<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members
will rally outside Te Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki Makau Rau |
Auckland University of Technology’s Council meeting on
Monday afternoon, a day that a decision on the future of up
to 150 staff is expected to be made.</p>

<p>TEU’s branch
president at AUT, David Sinfield, is particularly frustrated
with Vice Chancellor Damon Salesa’s refusal to directly
answer questions about a restructuring that’s set to lead
to over 200 job losses.</p>

<p>“We wrote to Professor
Salesa over a month ago to ask him to front up in person and
tell our members to our faces why he wants to axe so many of
their jobs. It took him over a month to reply, and he still
has not met with us.”</p>

<p>“Our members are extremely
upset, and deserve better from their Vice Chancellor.
Monday’s rally will be their chance to deliver their
message directly to Damon Salesa’s
employer.”</p>

<p>“Two weeks ago, the Vice Chancellor celebrated
AUT’s high Times Higher Education ranking ‘for research
impact and international outlook’ by acknowledging
“the huge amount of hard work put in by our staff…”
– Making 230 of them redundant and offering effective pay
cuts to the rest not only makes a mockery of his stated
gratitude but it puts the future of our university at risk.
Council must intervene.”</p>

<p>The rally will take place
on the Corner of Symonds and St Paul streets from 3-4pm on
Monday 31st
October.</p><p>
