<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members at
all eight of Aotearoa’s universities attended a series of
paid two-hour union meetings today, and almost unanimously
asked for sector-wide strike action ballots to be held for
each of their collective agreements. Collective agreement
negotiations have been ongoing across the university sector
since July, with an 8% pay rise the main focus of union
claims.</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei Takirua – Ahumahi | Assistant
National Secretary – Industrial, Irena Brörens says
“our members want a real pay rise that meets inflation,
reflects the indispensable work they do and begins to
address the reprioritisation of university spending away
from people and into buildings.”</p>

<p>Data from BERL, published
by the TEU a month ago, shows operating expenses across
the sector grew by 18% in real terms between 2008 and 2020
while staff costs only went up by 7% over the same
period.</p>

<p>TEU Branch President at Te Herenga Waka |
Victoria University of Wellington Dougal McNeill says
“it’s energising to see union members so strong and
unified across the Aotearoa university
sector.”</p>

<p>“Staff worked incredibly hard during the
pandemic to keep tertiary education going through a national
crisis. Over the past two years we have had to deliver
classes both online and in person which effectively doubled
what for many were already unmanageable workloads caused by
persistent cost cutting and underinvestment in staff. We are
in no mood to take an effective pay cut on the back of
that.”</p>

<p>Irena Brörens put
tertiary employers on notice as far back as April when she
said “Aotearoa universities have been, for the most
part, reporting healthy surpluses in recent times and with
the New Zealand economy in a strong position, with good GDP
growth, pay increases that match the rising cost of living
are affordable for New Zealand. This year we won’t be
accepting the impact of COVID-19 as an excuse for low pay
offers.”</p>

<p>Today, Brörens adds “by all university
members taking action together we can make a strong
statement to employers and the government that enough is
enough.”</p>

<p>TEU members at University of Auckland, AUT,
University of Waikato, Massey University, Victoria
University of Wellington, Canterbury University, Lincoln
University and University of Otago will decide whether or
not to take strike action in an online ballot next
week.</p>
