           <h1>AUT Proposes To Join Race To The Bottom</h1>

	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
dismayed to learn of Te Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki Makau Rau |
Auckland University of Technology’s plans to cut as many
as 230 jobs by year’s end – especially so, considering
rationale that includes a desire to reduce personnel costs
from 64% of operating expenses down to below 60% as a result
of benchmarking with other universities.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei
Takirua – Ahumahi | Assistant National Secretary –
Industrial, Irena Brörens says “it’s sad to see AUT now
joining the race to the bottom other universities have been
engaging in for many years. Our
research has shown spending on staff falling, as a
percentage of operating costs, across the sector and, as
we have repeatedly pointed out, it’s a sign that
universities are devaluing staff who should be the basis of
any human service. This is not a strategy AUT should be
trying to emulate. Any university should be proud to invest
significantly in staff.”</p><p>The consultation document
also cites a decrease in student numbers across some
programmes and disciplines as a reason for the
proposal.</p><p>But as Irena Brörens points out, “staff
cuts are never the way to address temporary fluctuations in
student numbers. We have seen time and time again that they
only result in unsustainable workloads and reduced service
for students.”</p>

<p>TEU organiser at AUT, Jill Jones,
describes the proposal as “bitterly disappointing. It’s
a slap in the face for our members, who have been working
very hard to keep their university running through the
COVID-19 pandemic, a ‘hiring freeze’ and a voluntary
leaving scheme that has already left many with high
workloads due to already reduced staffing not to mention a
‘travel ban’ that has made AUT a less attractive place
to work than other universities.”</p><p>“We will do
everything we can to oppose these unnecessary cuts and
support our members through what is set to be a very
difficult time.”</p><p>AUT’s most recent annual report
shows it made a $12.8 million surplus last year, almost
double its $6.8 million forecast.</p><p>TEU members will
meet later this week to discuss next
steps.</p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
