<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members
have formally delivered gender pay equity claims to
university employers across Aotearoa today. The multi-union
and multi-employer claims are being jointly raised by TEU,
PSA and TIASA and target female-dominated and low paid
university clerical administration and library
work.</p>

<p>TEU Te Pou Whirinaki | National Women’s
Officer Dr Sarah Proctor-Thomson says “this is an
important milestone in a long journey. TEU members have been
meeting and working on these two gender pay equity claims
since February, and we are excited to be finally moving the
campaign into the next phase.”</p>

<p>“Many library
assistants and clerical administration workers in the
Aotearoa university sector are paid at or little more than
the Living Wage. Comparable roles that are not female
dominated are paid significantly more. This must be
addressed and corrected.”</p>

<p>As Aimee Lowe, a TEU
member and Library Assistant at Te Herenga Waka | Victoria
University, pointed
out a little over a month ago, “even if a library
assistant moves into a librarian role, they would be better
off in an entry level role in a different
sector.”</p>

<p>“Library assistants, along with clerical
and administration workers, deserve to be recognised as
skilled professionals and have our mahi be a financially
viable career choice. We stay in our jobs because we love
what we do, but that shouldn’t be an excuse for the
tertiary sector to ignore the clear discrepancy in our pay
when compared to similar roles traditionally dominated by
men.”
</p>

<p>From here, the eight university employers are
now required by law (Equal Pay Act 1972) to consider the
claims together as an employer group and respond as to
whether they deem the claims arguable and requiring
evaluation.</p>

<p>Unions and the employers are then
mandated to work collaboratively to gather data and evaluate
the true value of the work covered by the claim and,
finally, to set an equitable level of
remuneration.</p>
