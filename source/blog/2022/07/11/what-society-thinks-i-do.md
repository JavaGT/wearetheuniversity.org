<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union are
lifting the lid on a clandestine campaign they have been
quietly running over the past six weeks with the aim of
changing public perceptions of university workers.</p>

<p>TEU
members have been chalking pavements and putting up posters
on campuses and other public locations simply containing the
hashtag #WhatSocietyThinksIDo. Today’s reveal marks the
start of a nationwide push to show the public what we
actually do.</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra
Grey says tertiary education staff go above and beyond every
day to deliver quality education to Aotearoa’s future
workers and leaders.</p>

<p>“Our members work long hours
and their workloads were excessive before the COVID-19
pandemic hit. But since March 2020, when staff had 48
hours’ notice to transfer all courses online, and worked
around the clock to do so, our members have had to do twice
the work to deliver both online and in person while still
finding time to do administration tasks as well as hit
research targets.”</p>

<p>“And to top it all off, staff
have had to bear the brunt of constant funding cuts that
have left fewer and fewer people doing more and more
work.”</p>

<p>With university pay settlements having
fluctuated between 1% and 3% in recent years, university
staff are gearing up for a big push to keep pace with
Aotearoa’s 30-year high inflation rate.</p>

<p>Sandra Grey
says “the TEU is signalling that the time has come to find
a circuit breaker. The tertiary sector needs to find more
resources to pay staff properly. That’s what this year’s
campaign is all about.”</p>
