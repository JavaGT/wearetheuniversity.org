           <h1>VUWSA Statement On Freedom Convoy Protest</h1>

           <span class="byline"><b>Monday, 14 February 2022,  1:17 pm</b><br>
             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/VUWSA">VUWSA</a></b></span>

         </div>

	 <p>
         </p><p>VUWSA are firm advocates of the right to protest and
believe in the importance of organizing and speaking out,
but we stand against the Freedom Convoy and their occupation
of Te Herenga Waka - Victoria University of Wellington
grounds.</p><p>We do not support their kaupapa and their way
of protesting. Their actions have gone beyond peaceful
protest. Since the arrival of the Convoy on February 8th,
the Convoy has spilled from Parliament grounds across onto
Bunny St, Molesworth St, the Lambton Bus Terminal and the
Old Government Building lawns, forcing the closure of the
university’s Pipitea campus for safety reasons, alongside
the disruption of bus services to other campuses. There have
also been notable incidences of harassment and vandalism
towards those who live and work in the area.</p><p>There is
no place for intimidation and harassment which puts the
safety and wellbeing of the public, students and staff at
risk. Our university community has a right to access campus
- our place of work and study - safely. In uncertain times
like these, we should be standing together to protect our
community; not against.</p><p>We believe the situation could
and should have been handled better by the University,
Wellington City Council, and law enforcement. Out of safety
and caution, students and staff are now being directed to
stay home. It should not have reached the point where the
protest has overflowed from Parliament grounds to directly
impact campus premises, and the safety and wellbeing of our
community has been put at risk.</p><p>VUWSA calls for the
University, Wellington City Council and law enforcement to
take action against the dangerous and unwelcome gridlock of
campus thoroughfare and occupation of university
premises.</p>
