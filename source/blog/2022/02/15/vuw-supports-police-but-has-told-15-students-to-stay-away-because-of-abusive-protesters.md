<p>Report from RNZ<br>
The police’s cautious approach to the protest that is paralysing central Wellington has the backing of Victoria University even though its city campus is now locked down and staff and students have been abused.<span id="more-142586"></span></p>

<p>Vice-chancellor Grant Guilford told Morning Report the summer trimester at the business and law schools next to Parliament grounds has been disrupted.</p>

<p>About 1500 students and 300 staff have been told to stay home and join classes online as protesters occupy their car park and camp on the front lawns.</p>

<p>He said some of the protesters are being abusive and physically intimidating. “That sense of intimidation is deeply felt by our female students and staff and as a result we’ve advised them to stay away.</p>

<p>“We’re also concerned that if the police do act and there is a physical removal of those protesters then that’s right on our doorstep and that melee might catch our students and staff unawares. So we’re just having to wait it out.”</p>

<p>Professor Guilford said the university supported the police’s careful approach to a complex situation.</p>

<p>He had walked around the crowd and observed some very passionate people who did not seem about to move on unless they gained some concessions or were physically removed.</p>

<p>“So quite a tricky situation.”</p>

<p>A trespass notice has been given to police so they can use it when they see fit, Professor Guilford said. “But we are determined not to act in isolation from the police for obvious reasons.”</p>

<p>The main bus terminal is also closed, affecting students who need to travel from many parts of the city.</p>

<p>Trimester one is due to begin shortly, with 22,000 students potentially affected.</p>

<p>The university was taking extra security precautions for its property, he said.</p>

<p>Former government trade minister and ambassador to the United States, Tim Groser, who lives opposite parliament is praising the police’s “gentle approach”. He described the protest as “extremely disruptive”.</p>

<p>He said with 95 percent of eligible New Zealanders being vaccinated and broadly supportive of the vaccine mandates, it was impossible to understand how the protesters thought they could succeed.</p>

<p>He is strongly supportive of the police’s approach. “The only way to resolve it is how they are approaching it which is: don’t set artificial deadlines, try and identify influencers and try to work towards a peaceful solution in the long run.”</p>
