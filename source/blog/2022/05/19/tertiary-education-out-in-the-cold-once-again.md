<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union and the
New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations are
disappointed to see the tertiary education sector largely
ignored once again in the Labour government’s fifth Budget
since taking office in 2017.</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei | National
Secretary Sandra Grey says “for a high wage economy, for
the transformation plans the government is purporting to
deliver, tertiary education cannot be left in the cold. If
you’re not investing in our sector, you’re not
investing.”</p>

<p>“With CPI at a thirty-year high, to
not have inflation-proofed Vote Tertiary Education at the
very least, shows that whatever the leaders of our sector
are doing to argue their case, it’s not working.
Universities in particular need to work with us to jointly
advocate address the funding crisis.”</p>

<p>“While on an
individual level, there has been some relief from the
current economic downturn, 2022/23 total appropriations for
tertiary education have gone down. The effect of this is no
money for training counsellors, Information Technology
specialists, farmers, forestry workers, or te reo Māori
speakers among other areas needed to deliver a wellbeing
Budget.”.</p>

<p>“In addition, there is nothing to
encourage our Māori members in this Budget. How is this
going to increase Māori engagement in the tertiary
sector?”</p>

<p>“Tertiary staff wellbeing is being harmed
by continued underfunding. This means a reduction in the
quality of education and the support we can give our
learners.”</p>

<p>NZUSA National President Andrew Lessells
says that “a real-terms cut in tertiary funding will have
a huge impact on students. Staff conditions of work are
students’ conditions of learning, and this Budget will
mean more staff burnout, poorer support for students, and
larger class sizes. If the Government truly values quality
tertiary education, they need to fund
it.”</p>

<p>“Students themselves are bearing the brunt of
the cost-of-living crisis. A one-off, tokenistic $350 band
aid won’t fix the broken student allowance system and is
yet another example of the Government claiming to care about
wellbeing while presenting us with an ambulance at the
bottom of the cliff.”</p>

<p>“We need a universal student
allowance to make sure that we can afford to live while
studying and we need a well-funded tertiary sector to make
sure that the education we’re engaging in is actually up
to
scratch.”</p>
