<p>A
new report shows Aotearoa’s university staff have been
getting an increasingly raw deal from their employers over
the past twelve years.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Te Hautū
Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union commissioned BERL
(Business and Economic Research Limited) to review the
annual reports of Aotearoa’s eight universities. They
collectively show inflation adjusted growth
of:</p><ul><li>Total operating revenue –
25%</li><li>Government funding – 16.5%</li><li>Student fee
revenue – 45%</li><li>Research Revenue –
48%</li><li>Total operating expenditure –
18%</li></ul><p>Yet personnel expenses have only grown by 7%
over the same period in spite of steady growth in full time
staff head count (FTE).</p>

<p>TEU activist and Branch
President at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | The University of
Canterbury Rob Stowell says “we’ve known for some time
that our salaries have been falling behind our colleagues
overseas and in other professions but to see such hard data
that shows the extent to which we’re being de-prioritiesd
by our employers is a real kick in the
guts.”</p>

<p>“It's disturbing to see graphically how
universities are spending less and less of their income on
staff. It's time for all our universities to invest in
what's most important, their people.”</p>

<p>“Our branch
will be digesting these numbers over the next few weeks and
they will certainly be at the forefront of our minds as we
discuss pay with our employers and our members throughout
this year’s collective agreement negotiations.”</p>

<p>Te
Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra Grey says “this
report shows two things – our members deserve a real pay
rise and the university sector can afford to invest in
staff.”</p>

<p>“It’s a matter of priorities – do the
Vice Chancellors and the public value university staff
enough to ensure they are properly remunerated for the work
they are doing? Or are they happy to watch talented staff
walk away from the sector or overseas to contribute to
another country’s knowledge base?”</p>

<p>“Universities
are a human service, their job is to supply the public with
the knowledge of their staff, whether they are professors,
tutors, librarians or administrators. It’s time to invest
properly in people.”</p>

<p>In the leadup to today’s
launch, the
TEU highlighted the fact that average salaries in
2007/2008 have not kept up with wage inflation (known as the
Labour Cost Index). For example, at the University of Otago
average salaries have fallen by 10% in real terms over the
13 years BERL looked at. For the University of Auckland,
that figure is 17%.</p>

money go? Analysis of NZ universities’ financial
statements’ – can be viewed
