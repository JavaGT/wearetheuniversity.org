<p>Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington (VUW)
has barely backed down from the controversial
Whiria Project with further announcements regarding
cost-cutting measures, signalling significant proposed job
losses.</p>

<p>VUW has signalled a $33.5m deficit for 2021
and are now threatening “additional measures” to reduce
the university’s workforce despite the State Services
Commission providing guidance to universities to maintain
restraint and retain jobs during Covid-19 – a factor that
has also been previously supported by Minister
Hipkins.</p>

<p>Government rules have changed and TEU is not
convinced that the university is doing all it can to apply
new approaches to prevent cuts, VUW needs to open its books
to rethink its economic approach moving forward.</p>

<p>Where
the tertiary sector is poised for a 2021 increase in student
enrolments as Covid-effected New Zealanders retrain and
upskill; cutting jobs at this juncture makes no sense in
relation to rebuilding the future of all New Zealanders.
Retaining people in jobs is a collective priority as we face
uncertain times.</p>

<p>TEU co-branch President Dougal
McNeill, has spoken out saying; “It is going to do
significant damage to Victoria’s reputation, and its
capacity to serve students and community, at a time when we
are going to have increased domestic need.”</p>

<p>McNeill
goes further stating; “We’re not talking here about some
minor tinkering but deep, damaging cuts to the
institution”</p>

<p>TEU warns that this recent announcement
is untenable to members who are prepared to continue the
fight to pushback against the latest announcement.</p>

<p>TEU
National Secretary Sandra Grey states “any proposed job
cuts won't help us deliver opportunities to kiwis; what we
know for sure is there is a reliance on international
student revenue due to a failed market approach to tertiary
education which all politicians and industry leaders need to
address immediately.”</p>

<p>“What Covid-19 has made
crystal clear is the value of tertiary education and staff
of tertiary education are now on the frontline of building
back better.”</p>

<p>TEU challenges all decision makers in
the tertiary sector to consider the future value and benefit
of education to all New Zealanders before making any
decisions to cut jobs or undermine the
sector.</p>
