         </p><p>Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato University of Waikato tauira
and kaimahi Māori who have raised serious allegations of
institutional racism at the university have a right to a
full investigation says Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union (TEU).</p><p>Allegations of structural
and casual racism have been reported and a process of
Protected Disclosure (whistleblower) Act has been undertaken
to voice collective concern.</p><p>TEU National President
Michael Gilchrist says it is clear that many tauira and
kaimahi Māori have been fearful of raising their concerns,
fearful of retribution if they questioned the
institution’s leadership and direction,</p><p>“A proper
process is important for those raising allegations of
institutional racism and for the institution.”</p><p>TEU
is in conversation with its Māori members and the
Chancellor to ensure any investigation protects their
rights, while ensuring natural justice for other
parties.</p><p>Vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders in
tertiary education know the importance of open and robust
debate, and we would expect nothing less at Te Whare
Wānanga o Waikato. We are concerned to think kaimahi Māori
are fearful of doing their job and critiquing their own
institution. Kaimahi Māori voices must be heard to ensure
due
process.</p>
