<p>“Students are barely
managing to pay their rent, they can’t afford nutritious
food to keep them going, and they are forced to live in
damp, cold, mouldy flats. Turning on the heater is a luxury
many students can’t afford” she says.</p>

<p>“As an
immediate measure, benefits, student allowances and
StudyLink living costs must be urgently raised. However,
there needs to also be transformative overhaul of the
welfare system so that every New Zealander, whether they
receive a benefit, are studying or in work, has a liveable
income” says
Lenihan-Ikin.</p>
