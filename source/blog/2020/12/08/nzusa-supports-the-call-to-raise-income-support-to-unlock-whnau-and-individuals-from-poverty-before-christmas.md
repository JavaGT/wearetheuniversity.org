         </p><p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA)
supports the call to raise income support to unlock whānau
and individuals from poverty before Christmas.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/427834818236490/">Today</a>,
NZUSA joined Auckland Action Against Poverty at Parliament
to call on the government to lift benefits and low incomes
to liveable levels so that New Zealanders have enough to
lead full and happy lives. This follows the call of 75
organisations, including NZUSA, who signed an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/income-support-must-go-up-before-christmas">Open
Letter</a> calling on senior Ministers to raise benefits,
and supported the Auckland Action Against Poverty
protest</p><p>NZUSA National President, Isabella
Lenihan-Ikin, who spoke at the protest today, says
“everyone benefits, and our economy benefits, when New
Zealanders are trained and educated. However, the weekly
cost of being a student, and the limited government support,
is a significant barrier to many people being able to begin
or continue studying.”</p><p>There are two ways that
full-time students can access weekly support; Student
Allowance or Living Costs. Student Allowance varies in
amount but has stringent eligibility criteria, depending on
the students individual situation, but Living Costs is a
maximum of $239.76 per week.</p><p>NZUSA President says
“right now, tertiary students across the country are
living in poverty because Student Allowance and Living Costs
are set at unliveable rates.”</p>

<p>“Students are barely
managing to pay their rent, they can’t afford nutritious
food to keep them going, and they are forced to live in
damp, cold, mouldy flats. Turning on the heater is a luxury
many students can’t afford” she says.</p><p>“As an
immediate measure, benefits, student allowances and
StudyLink living costs must be urgently raised. However,
there needs to also be transformative overhaul of the
welfare system so that every New Zealander, whether they
receive a benefit, are studying or in work, has a liveable
income” says
Lenihan-Ikin.</p>
