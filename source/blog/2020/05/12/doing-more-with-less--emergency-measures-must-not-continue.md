<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | New Zealand Tertiary Education
Union (TEU) has released a comprehensive report highlighting
systemic issues for members in the tertiary education sector
during Covid-19.</p>

<p>The report entitled <i>Tertiary
Lives | Covid-19</i> is the consolidation of a survey
conducted by the TEU of its members during the pandemic.
Over 800 respondents took part over five days, responding to
a range of questions about their experiences since the
COVID-19 crisis took hold.</p>

<p>The survey and associated
report reveal how the rapid pivot in educational delivery
during the crisis is affecting staff and shows the real
impact of the pandemic. Specific issues include workloads,
stress, leadership and extend to staff having difficulty
getting the right technological support to do their
jobs.</p>

<p>The survey responses show real concerns emerging
in the midst of extreme change and disruption. TEU National
President Michael Gilchrist says concerns range from the
extra hours needed to work online, to growing concern that
students aren’t getting the best out of their learning
experience, to institutional leaders ignoring advice. Some
respondents said that institutional leaders were failing
even to ask what is happening in virtual
classrooms.</p>

<p>Staff have proved their worth during this
time. They have proved that they are the heart of tertiary
institutions. But emergency remote teaching – along with
emergency remote pastoral care, administrative support,
technical support and so on - can’t just become the norm.
Temporary solutions can’t become permanent. Institutional
leaders must go back to staff and work with them to plan the
next phase, especially as learners begin returning on
site.</p>

<p>TEU has taken a proactive approach conducting
and publishing this survey to ensure that the voices of
academic, allied and professional staff are being
heard.</p>

<p>Gilchrist says ”This survey highlights the
concerns our members have that there are decisions being
made that could have an impact on future employment
conditions and job security. Results show us that there
needs to be some recognition of the time, skill and energy
that staff have put in and continue to put
in.”</p>

<p>Given the scope of the survey results and report
TEU is again calling on the Minister of Education to call a
meeting with institutional leaders, government departments,
student representatives, industry and employer
representatives and the TEU to ensure what happens next
meets the needs of all involved in the sector.</p>

<p>“A
whole sector approach is the only way we can make sure all
communities and employers have access to the education and
training needed to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic”
says
Gilchrist</p>
