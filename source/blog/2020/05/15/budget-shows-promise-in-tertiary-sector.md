<p>It’s great to see Budget commitments that will get more
people into trades and vocational training and breathe life
back into community education, says Michael Gilchrist,
National President, Te Hautū Kahurangi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For
over a decade TEU has been fighting for improved funding to
allow for accessible publicly funded education in order to
reach all communities.</p>

<p>This is why TEU supports the
increased long-term investment in trades and community
education - as educational value is about more than economic
recovery.</p><blockquote><p>“Budget 2020 has signalled
some hope that there will be reinvestment in tertiary
education, recognising its value for our families and
communities. But more will be needed” argues
Gilchrist.</p></blockquote><p>The tertiary sector has borne
the brunt of chronic underfunding by successive governments
for over a decade, often with no increase in Vote Tertiary
Education. This year there is a modest increase for the
entire sector of 1.6% and a strong additional spend on
trades education, but it certainly doesn’t plug the
overall funding gap which leads to course closures and
students missing out.</p>

<p>“The government must move
urgently on its promised new funding model” according to
Gilchrist.</p>

<p>Added to the long-term funding woes, the
nation’s COVID-19 response has undercut the revenue raised
from international students in our public tertiary
institutions.</p>

<p>Gilchrist says “Over the next few
months we will be actively watching the impact of the loss
of international students.We need the government to
convene a national international students hui to address
this issue. We cannot allow our public tertiary education
institutions to again be reliant on revenue from fee paying
international students.”</p>

<p>Staff in lecture theatres,
libraries, workshops, students support services, and labs
have together been working hard to ensure all students have
ongoing access to tertiary education. But this Budget
doesn’t plug the overall gap in tertiary education funding
which would ensure that we can help New Zealanders have a
brighter future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s a start, but together
we can do
better.”</p>
