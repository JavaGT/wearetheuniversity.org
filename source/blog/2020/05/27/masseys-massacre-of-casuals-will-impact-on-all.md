<p>A memorandum sent to staff at Massey University outlines
plans to restrict casual staff expenditure for the remainder
of 2020 in the College of Science and comes in the wake of
the Massey Business School slashing their casual budget by
50%. This is cause for great concern as it erodes quality
teaching and undermines all workers and their ability to do
their jobs.</p>

<p>The rash move by Massey signals that the
sector has become reliant on workers who are on fixed and
casual appointments. And is devasting for all vulnerable
workers notably māori, pasifika, students and people with
families. This move highlights the unequal effects of job
cuts and austerity measures, with the greatest impact
falling on those least able to afford it.</p>

<p>University
of Otago staff member and TEU Council Member Joshua James
has called out Massey stating “Cuts to the casual staffing
levels at the College of Sciences is a blow to those who
rely on casual roles to make ends meet, it is a disservice
to students, and the academic and research community and
will affect all of those who are trying to begin a career in
the tertiary sector, including PhD candidates.”</p>

<p>It
also signals the depth of funding problems in the sector
which have been aggravated by COVID-19. Students have been
treated like cash cows with a heavy reliance on
international students and Massey’s memo shows how fragile
the systems of funding and expenditure are.</p>

<p>There are
also growing concerns that staff workloads will grow
exponentially and stress will rise to a breaking point. Who
will do the work and fill the gap left behind when casual
staff are cut? And what kind of erosion of quality education
in the sector do these cuts to the workforce
highlight?</p>

<p>James goes further stating “the
government has been quite clear: tertiary institutions, like
all other employers must look after their
workers.”</p>

<p>Massey’s announcement is a blow for all
workers in the sector. Cuts undermine all the good work of
everyone in the sector. Our communities need reassurance
that quality education is a priority not just during the
crisis but in the future. In response TEU is calling for a
national hui to address the effects of COVID-19, and for all
tertiary institutions to act as collaborative partners in
the national
recovery.</p>
