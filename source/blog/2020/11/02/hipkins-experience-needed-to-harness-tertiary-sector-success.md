<p>TEU welcomes the re-appointment of Hon Chris Hipkins as
the Minister of Education. TEU members have high hopes that
the experience and expertise the Minister brings to the
sector will translate into decisive action and equitable
outcomes.</p>

<p>Both the Reform of Vocational Education and
the ongoing funding stalemate in universities are at a
critical stage. The tertiary education sector needs
considerable investment and innovative direction to ensure
an economically sustainable and equitable sector for
all.</p>

<p>The Labour Government has promised a targeted
approach to additional spending on tertiary education, with
a focus on areas that are deemed critical for the country's
economic recovery from COVID-19, including free
apprenticeships and spending on targeted areas of vocational
training, and the completion of the reform of the vocational
education system.</p>

<p>While TEU applauds spending on
tertiary education in building-back from Covid-19, the focus
on vocational education and training does not go far enough
to <i>build back better</i> for all New Zealanders, or in
protecting the sector both in the short-term and for future
generations.</p>

<p>Hipkins’ appointment is a chance for
all tertiary education leaders to work together to create
and invest in the kind of sector that values and supports
teaching and learning experiences. Aotearoa’s future
success is inherently connected to the recovery of the
tertiary sector that looks set for exponential growth in
2021.</p>

<p>TEU Tumu Whakarae | National President Michael
Gilchrist goes further stating, “the shortfall in funding
for domestic students in comparison to international
students must be addressed. We will be asking the Minister
to give his urgent attention to this issue”</p>

<p>TEU also
looks forward to working with Associate Ministers Jan
Tinetti, Hon Kelvin Davis (Māori Education) and Hon Aupito
William Sio (Pacific
Peoples).</p>
