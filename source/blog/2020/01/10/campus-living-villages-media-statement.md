<p><br><strong>Campus Living Village (CLV) Group MD John
Schroder welcomes the release of the report by former High
Court Judge Hon Kit Toogood QC into the delay in finding
Mason Pendrous, following his death at Sonoda Residential
Village at the University of Canterbury late last
year.</strong></p>

<p>“I want to acknowledge and pay my
respects to Mason’s family.  We should never forget their
unspeakable loss.” said Mr Schroder.</p>

<p>The
recommendations attached to the Toogood Report outline
several areas for improvement for both CLV and the
University of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Mr Schroder says “no one
wants to see the tragic events of last year repeated and CLV
will work through the joint recommendations in the report,
with the University of Canterbury, and make any further
changes that both parties consider necessary at the
residential facilities managed by CLV."</p>

<p>CLV also
undertook a review of its own processes and procedures and
has already implemented a number of enhancements for the
2020 academic year.</p>

<p>•	The creation of more
“touch points” between residents and staff with more
staffed reception areas closer to each Village and dedicated
reception areas at Sonoda, Ilam and University Hall during
office hours.<br>•	The continuation of our after hours’
support provided via dedicated Evening Duty Managers, 24/7
Security Staff and Resident helpline.<br>•	The recruitment
and appointment of dedicated Village Managers at
Sonoda/Hyashi, Ilam Apartments and University Hall<br>•	An
intensive retraining and re-education program for all
relevant UCA staff on standard operating
procedures.<br>•	Boosting on-boarding and induction
processes for new staff members including Residential
Assistants.<p>
<p>In addition, we are looking at social
cohesion improvements including a review of our dedicated
1st Year Residential Life Program for Semester 1, 2020 which
provides a high level of support and connectivity for
CLV’s residential community assisting with the transition
from home life; and, in Semester 2, the introduction of a
2nd year plus Residential Life Program providing further
support for students continuing their studies.</p>

<p>Across the CLV Group we are also in the process of
reviewing the use of Active Occupation Technology, to better
inform the occupation of residential spaces, while still
respecting the privacy each of resident.</p>

<p>There are
lessons to be learnt for CLV, and together with the
University we will work on the recommendations in the
Toogood Report and the new Education (Pastoral Care of
Domestic Tertiary Students) Interim Code of Practice 2019,
that have not already been covered by the changes we have
made over the last two months.<p>

<p>Everyone in the
University community has a role and we’re committed to
working together to provide a safe and supportive
environment for young people to learn and grow,” said Mr
Schroder.<br><p>
