	 <p>
         </p><p>Irresponsible and unhelpful is how the National President
of the Tertiary Education Union is describing moves by two
universities to cut jobs due to the corona virus travel
ban.</p><p>The vice-chancellors of both Auckland and
Wellington’s Victoria universities have suggested the
corona virus travel ban preventing some international
students from coming to New Zealand must flow directly on to
cuts in jobs. At the University of Auckland there is hiring
freeze in place, and at Victoria University of Wellington
the vice-chancellor has announced likely
redundancies.</p><p>TEU National President, Michael
Gilchrist, says this is premature and capacity must be
retained in these institutions and staff are the most
important element of that capacity.</p><p>“There are many
other ways in which the impacts of the travel ban could be
buffered. We agree that government, through the Tertiary
Education Commission, has a vital role to play in that
process and have asked for a meeting to work out a
nation-wide strategy to address the impact of the travel
ban.”</p><p>Staff cuts should be the last option to be
considered, according to Gilchrist.</p><p>“It is ironic
that once again staff feature as pawns in the power games of
vice-chancellors, rather than being valued and respected for
the complexity of their work and the care they bring to the
staff-student relationship. Many staff are already doing a
huge amount of extra work to minimise the impact of the
travel ban."</p><p>The TEU is pressuring the Tertiary
Education Commission to call a meeting of all the relevant
parties across the tertiary sector – staff and student
representatives, CEs and VCs, and officials – so that a
nationally co-ordinated and coherent response can be
developed instead of the current knee-jerk reaction that is
being demonstrated at the moment by a couple of our
universities.</p>
