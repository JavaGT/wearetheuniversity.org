	 <p>
         </p><p>Forty-two tertiary students’ associations across
Aotearoa, supported by the three National Students’
Associations - the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations, Te Mana Ākonga and Tauira Pasifika - have
come together to develop the <strong>National Student Action
Plan on COVID-19.</strong></p><p>The plan covers what
tertiary students require from the Government and their
tertiary providers to get through this very uncertain
time.</p><p>The plan includes four requests of the
Government, which need to be made available to all tertiary
students - full time and part time, graduate and
undergraduate. This includes people who are currently
ineligible for StudyLink support because of their
age.</p><p>These four demands of the Government
are:</p><ul><li>As a temporary measure, extend the existing
Student Allowance to <strong>all </strong>domestic
students.</li><li>Create a COVID-19 Hardship Fund to provide
relief for tertiary students seeking cover for emergency
COVID-19-related costs. This could include, but not limited
to emergency transport costs, bereavement costs, emergency
technology costs including the cost of purchasing a device
and internet packages for students currently
without.</li><li>Include tertiary students in the Winter
Energy Package.</li><li>Increase funding for online mental
health support to ensure that students remain supported
during a period of isolation.</li></ul><p>The New Zealand
Union of Students’ Association President Isabella
Lenihan-Ikin says that “students are finding themselves in
a very vulnerable financial position. The amount they
receive through StudyLink is insufficient to cover essential
living costs at the best of times, let along when students
are losing their employment.”</p>

<p>Mamaeroa Merito,
Co-Tumuaki of Te Mana Ākonga says “... We are looking for
reassurance for our Tauira from the Government during this
trying time. Whilst we are supportive of the Government
doubling the Winter Energy Package, increasing the benefit
by $25 per week and introducing a 6-month mortgage holiday,
students haven’t seen any Government support during this
time” Mamaeroa says.</p><p>Deborah, a mature student
studying at Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology was relying
on her part time job to met the shortfall between the
student allowance and her rent. Students who lose their jobs
in this situation face financial insecurity.</p><p>Deborah
said “when I rang StudyLink I was told that they were
receiving many similar calls from students in the same
situation and were waiting to see if the Government was
going to make any announcement to alleviate this
situation.”</p><p>“The lack of financial support for
students could mean that students abandon their studies and
apply for the Job Seeker Benefit, because on this benefit
students would receive the $25 increased and the Winter
Energy Payment allowing them to pay their rent and power
bills while they have no job” she says.</p><p>Ali Leota
President of Tauira Pasifika says “ Pasifika communities
already have odds stacked against them. With a loss of
employment and not being able to meet StudyLink criteria,
many Pasifika students are finding basic living and the
procurement of essential necessities a real challenge. This
needs to be at the forefront, otherwise we risk having more
students fall through the cracks. We have the leadership,
but we are looking for financial support and stability over
this uncertain period”</p><p>NZUSA President Isabella
Lenihan-Ikin says “This is the time that the Government
needs to ensure that students are supported to remain in
their studies.”</p><p>“The Government needs to get real
about the financial insecurity students face, and implement
urgent measures to support
them.”</p>
