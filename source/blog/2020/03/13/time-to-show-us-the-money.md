<p>“The need for a new funding model and interim measures
to keep tertiary education institutions that belong to
communities operating is well known. And we're not going to
let up until the Government ‘shows us the money’”,
says TEU’s National President.</p>

<p>TEU members are
taking actions across Aotearoa on Black Friday, 13 March, to
demand that the government gets polytechnics back into the
black.</p>

<p>Michael Gilchrist, Te Tumu Whakarae of Te
Hautū Kahurangi | NZ Tertiary Education Union says the
tutors, support staff, technicians, administrators,
lecturers and all staff in the polytechnic sector know
what’s at stake – access to education.</p>

<p>“They
don’t want to watch as more courses are cut and more hopes
dashed before a new, unified vocational education and
training network for New Zealand is able to soar. That’s
why they’re leading a day of action from Invercargill to
Auckland.”</p>

<p>On the eve of the most significant public
sector reform in a couple of decades, a reform promising
inclusive, accessible vocational education, the government
still hasn’t put the money on the table.</p>

<p>If we’re
going to ensure all New Zealanders get great educational
experiences through NZIST which begins operating on 1 April,
we must have the public behind it.</p>

<p>“We all benefit
from vocational education and training every day. We benefit
from having trained nurses, plumbers, technicians,
architects, early childhood workers, and much more – so we
need to make sure we find and fund better ways to support
their training.”</p>

<p>The Minister wants us to be behind
his vision and in the past has commented on how he needs the
support of staff, says Gilchrist.</p>

<p>“Well Minister,
the staff are again saying give them some certainty that
there’ll be enough money to make the vision a reality.
Enough money to ensure all communities do have access to
quality vocational training and to make sure staff have the
capacity to help create the new
world.”</p>
