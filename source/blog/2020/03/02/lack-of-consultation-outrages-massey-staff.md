<p>There will be meetings across the campuses of Massey
University this week with staff angry at plans to make major
changes in the College of Science and other changes in other
Colleges without any real opportunity for staff
input.</p>

<p>The meetings of affected members are only the
first steps in the push back against proposed changes which
could result in hundreds of job losses. On 12 March there
will be a paid stopwork meeting of all Massey
staff.</p>

<p>TEU organiser Heather Warren says there is
real anger at the proposed cuts because there is a feeling
that much has been predetermined by a “small group of
senior leaders. The proposal will cut courses and change the
style of delivery in other cases. We won’t stand by and
watch the Massey senior leadership team cut back
opportunities for students.”</p>

<p>TEU members have
looked carefully at the discussion documents and found that
most proposals reflect a kind of technological and financial
determinism are present. Warren says “we are questioning
the facts and figures used to justify the deep and drastic
changes being proposed. We know that the overall funding
model means our tertiary education institutions are
struggling, but we need our senior leaders to work with us
on getting a better funding model rather than taking these
kinds of drastic cost-cutting measures”, says
Warren.</p>

<p>“We know that the best educational quality
comes from making sure that decisions are made on sound
teaching and learning outcomes, and on values which support
the public
good.”</p>
