<p>‘The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) has written
directly to Tertiary Education Institutions (TEIs) advising
them that they are not required to to achieve a 3% surplus
in abnormal situations - and COVID-19 is exactly such a
situation.</p>

<p>‘Further, TEC expects institutions to use
the full range of financial options available to them in
responding to the COVID-19 travel ban, including utilising
surpluses builts up in relatively normal years, said
Tertiary Education Union National President Michael
Gilchrist today. They say that is part of the point of the
normal requirement for surpluses.</p>

<p>‘The TEU welcomes
recent advice from TEC Chief Executive, Tim Fowler, that a
3% surplus is not an expectation this year and that it is
seeking to ensure that any short or medium term financial
impacts on tertiary institutions are “managed
appropriately”, especially with regard to speculation
about potential staff cuts, TEU President Michael Gilchrist
said today</p>

<p>‘We are pleased to hear from TEC that
they acknowledge all the extra work staff are presently
doing in response to the effect on international students,
especially Chinese students – and that it is important
that TEIs are well placed to respond quickly once travel
restrictions are lifted (whenever that may be) – meaning
that they should not be looking at cutting staff in response
to these difficulties.</p>

<p>‘We think there may be more
TEC can do to support institutions financially, including
relaxing other financial expectations, and we will be
meeting with them to discuss that. We also continue to see a
national meeting of all concerned aimed at achieving the
maximum possible co-ordination between the parties as a
priority – something the TEC says is not ready to do
yet.</p>

<p>‘However, we see dropping any requirement to
show a 3% surplus as an important first step. It is a very
clear indication that institutions have other options for
coping with this problem other than cutting staff, Gilchrist
concluded.</p>
