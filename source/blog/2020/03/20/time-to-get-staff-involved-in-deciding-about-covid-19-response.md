<p>Wholesale changes to modes of delivery must not be made
without consulting staff and students, says the Tertiary
Education Union | Te Hautū Kahurangi.</p>

<p>Today both Auckland
and Massey
Universities have announced that in-person teaching and
assessment are optional for learners.</p>

<p>TEU National
President, Michael Gilchrist, says “These are
extraordinary times and the wellbeing of staff and learners
is crucial. However, Massey and Auckland are making changes
that are likely to involve huge additional workload demands
on teaching and administrative staff – we will not accept
that such edicts can be issued without consulting staff to
the greatest extent possible under these
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“We are advising members that it
is especially important that their workloads be reasonable,
equitable and safe at this time. Consultation is a vital
part of that imperative – and without it staff may be
forced to take other steps to ensure their
wellbeing.”</p>

<p>‘More broadly, we believe the correct
approach from institutions should be to follow the guidance
of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health as
to new risks and whether any additional steps are required
for staff and student safety. To date the Ministry of
Education has said that it should be business as usual for
all educational institutions, including universities,
barring any specific outbreaks. We don’t believe that
either institutions or staff unions should be
second-guessing this expert guidance – especially given
that it is informed by advice from many of our
members.’<p>

<p>Gilchrist notes the announcement today by
Victoria University calling for institutions to be guided by
Ministry of Health advice, neither moving in advance or
arrears of that advice – and applauds their offer of free
study from the start of Trimester 2 for domestic students
who have been impacted by COVID-19.</p>

<p>All these
developments – and the range of responses now emerging –
only serve to underline the need for a nationally
co-ordinated and consistent approach on the part of tertiary
education institutions to COVID -19. We have written again
to the Tertiary Education Commission asking them to
facilitate a meeting of all concerned to develop such an
approach.</p>

<p>TEU
members have been discussing how to ensure staff and student
well-being, and how to be supportive in ways that ensure
learning
continues.</p>
