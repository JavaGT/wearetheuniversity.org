<p>At meetings across the campuses of Massey University this
week staff expressed their anger at plans to make major
changes in the College of Science and other less extreme
ones in other Colleges without any real room for staff
input.</p>

<p>The members of Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union have chosen to down tools for two hours on
12 April at stopwork meetings on all three campuses of
Massey to discuss the far reaching discussion
documents.</p>

<p>TEU organiser Heather Warren says there is
real anger at the proposed cuts because there is a feeling
that much has been predetermined by a “small group of
senior leaders”.</p>

<p>“The proposal will cut courses
and change the style of delivery in other cases. We won’t
stand by and watch the Massey senior leadership team cut
back opportunities for students”.</p>

<p>TEU members have
pored over the consultation approach and feel that both
technological and financial determinism are present. Warren
says “we are concerned that the leadership has forgotten
what a university is for. And we are questioning the facts
and figures used to justify the deep and drastic
change.”</p>

<p>We know that the overall funding model
means our tertiary education institutions are struggling,
but we need our senior leaders to work with us on getting a
better funding model rather than taking such drastic
actions, says Warren.</p>

<p>“We know that the best
educational quality comes from making sure decisions are
made on sound teaching and learning outcomes; and on values
which support the public
good”.</p>
