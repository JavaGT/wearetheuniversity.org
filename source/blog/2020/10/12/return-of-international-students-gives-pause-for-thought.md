         </p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td><p>The tertiary
education sector continues to demonstrate it is at the
frontline in Aotearoa’s recovery as the Minister of
Education Chris Hipkins announces
the return of international students.</p><p>TEU welcomes
the safe return of international students and is now calling
on institutional leaders to take voluntary leaving and
enhanced retirement packages off the table.</p><p>TEU
National Secretary Sandra Grey comments on the announcement
stating: “Our institutions now have a clear signal that
international students will be coming back, that means they
can more confidently ride out the current dip in revenue
using their significant reserves. There is no need for job
cuts.”</p><p>The return of international students begins
with a scheme managed centrally by the Government and is an
opportunity to reflect on how institutions can support
educational experiences rather than competing for students
and treating learners as cash cows.</p><p>Grey goes further
stating “International education should be about
contributing to the whole of Aotearoa, not a single
institution or insular revenue stream.”</p><p>Any return
of international students must be worked through to ensure
safe and sustainable working, teaching, and learning
environments.</p><p>“This is just the beginning. We need
buy-in on how the sector is going to change and evolve in
the future. The closure of the borders due to COVID-19 has
illustrated just how broken our approach to international
education has been, and highlights the problems overall in
the funding of study at universities, wānanga, and
polytechnics.</p><p>Grey says “TEU is calling on all
leaders to lead by example and bring new ideas and new
approaches to the management of institutions in an all of
sector hui hosted by TEU on November 17th to plan for the
future of education
together.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
