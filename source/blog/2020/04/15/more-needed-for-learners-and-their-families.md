<p>Ākonga/Learners are some of our most vulnerable members
of society and more must be done to support them at this
extraordinary time says Te Hautū Kahurangi | The Tertiary
Education Union.</p>

<p>The government as part of its
COVID-19 response today announced a domestic
tertiary student package.</p>

<p>For Joshua James, U35
representative on the TEU National Council, the measures do
not go far enough, and the government should look at making
the student allowance universal to all students, at an
increased rate.</p>

<p>Students are facing financial hardship
because they can’t supplement their allowances or loans
with part time work. Like all New Zealanders they are often
taking on more family and community responsibilities. And on
top of this they are trying to adjust to changes in the mode
of delivery of courses says James.</p>

<p>“This is why it
is important for more to be done to support students and
ensure that those in training don’t end up dropping out
for economic reasons and adding to what will already be an
increasing unemployment line.”</p>

<p>James notes that
"many of our members at the TEU who are under 35 years old
are also students, and they need far more support than just
the increased ability to get more debt."</p>

<p>"Students
currently owe more than $16billion in student loans, and
with job prospects shrinking in the post-COVID economy,
burdening students with more debt will further undermine
their long-term futures."</p>

<p>TEU National President
Michael Gilchrist says TEU members are pleased to see the
government adjusting rules to ensure that students who
can’t complete study because of COVID-19 won’t be
penalised when it comes to the entitlement to student loans
or Fees Free tertiary study.</p>

<p>“But the decision to
continue support payments for students unable to study
on-line for only 8 weeks is not enough, neither is it enough
to have students borrowing another $1,000 for course related
costs on a temporary basis. It is important to remember too
that for apprentices and others doing on-job training the
effects will be even more severe and longer lasting than for
university students."</p>

<p>The TEU urges the Minister of
Education to keep working closely with students and staff in
the tertiary education to keep them engaged and develop a
deeper response.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern,
noted in her Press
Conference today (April 14) “education will be key to
our economic recovery”. This recovery must start now
making it easier for people to get into and stay in
study.</p>
