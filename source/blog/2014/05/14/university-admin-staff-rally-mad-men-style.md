         University admin staff rally 'Mad Men'
style</p><p><br>Administration staff at the University of
Auckland will gather in 1960s outfits on Friday 16 May to
tell their vice-chancellor they don't want their jobs to go
back in time.</p><p>The university plans to downshift hundreds
of its administration staff, mostly women, into new lower
level jobs.</p><p>"It's a move back in time for these women,"
says TEU organiser Jane Kostanich.</p><p>The university's
Faculty Administration Review (FAR) plans to cut over 100
jobs and change the job descriptions for a further 250. TEU
members at the university say many of these jobs will sit
lower on the university's scale, which in the long-term will
mean lower pay, less respect, and more work with less
responsibility.</p><p>Most of the women currently working for
the university's administration team needed a degree to get
their current job or added qualifications as part of their
professional development and many have years of
experience.</p><p>Administration staff plan to hold a rally
outside the vice-chancellor's office in the Registry
Building's Alfred Nathan House, at 12:30pm, 16
May.</p><p>ends
