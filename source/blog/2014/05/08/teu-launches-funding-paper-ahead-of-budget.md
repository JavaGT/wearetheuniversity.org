<p>TEU launches funding paper ahead of budget</p>

<p><br>TEU
launches the fifth of its Te Kaupapa Whaioranga papers
tomorrow, this time outlining what New Zealand needs to do
to restore funding to its public tertiary education
system.</p>

<p>The latest Te Kaupapa Whaioranga document will
precede the government's budget by a week, and will give an
alternative perspective for the direction parliament should
take to support high quality, accessible and equitable
tertiary education.</p>

<p>A week out from Budget 2014 and there
has been no hint of any significant announcements about
tertiary education. It seems likely that universities,
wānanga, polytechnics and others involved in public
tertiary education can expect more of the same.</p>

<p>However,
TEU national president Lesley Francey says people should
judge budget by its commitment to public education.</p>

<p>"If
treats education like an investment in the community and not
a subsidy for private business it will be a success. If this
gives more people the chance to study who would not
otherwise get an education it will be a success. But if it
is more of the same then it will exacerbate the failed cuts
and underfunding of the past five budgets."</p>

<p>Since 2009,
government funding for tertiary education, including student
support has fallen from $4.6 billion to $4.2 billion. If it
had adjusted for inflation that 2009 figure of $4.6 billion
would now be $5 billion. Treasury forecasts that tertiary
education spending will remain nearly flat until at least
2018 while inflation will rise another 11 percent by the end
of 2018.
</p>

<p>Over a similar period (2009 to 2012), the number
of actual student places (not funded student places) grew by
over 20,000 people. The tertiary education system is funding
more people for less money while costs rise.</p>

<p>Lesley
Francey says the budgets of the last five years are
unsustainable.</p>

<p>"Our real experience of recent budgets is
hundreds of good tertiary education staff have lost their
jobs, as institutions tighten their belts. Students real
experience is a government that has kept its promise not to
reintroduce interest on student loans but has taken every
other pernicious step it can to limit access to education
and impose higher costs on students."</p>

<p>TEU will launch its
Te Kaupapa Whaioranga - Funding Tertiary Education paper
at:<br>Unitec marae Te Noho
Kotahitanga<br>Auckland<br>1.30pm<br>Friday, 9 May
2014</p>
