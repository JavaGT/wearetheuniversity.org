<p><strong>Students occupy University of Auckland Vice
Chancellor’s Office</strong></p>

<p><br>A group of students
have chained themselves inside the University of Auckland
Vice Chancellor’s office. Another group are occupying the
building’s roof.</p>

<p>The protest comes in advance of the
University’s fee-setting meeting, where fees are expected
to be raised by 4%.</p>

<p>The students began the occupation at
9am, and are going to be joined by a rally at 1pm. They
intend to stay until the fee-setting meeting at 4pm.</p>

<p>“We
are here because the university continues to chain us to
debt by raising fees every year,” says Mikaela
Hunt.</p>

<p>“The fee-setting meeting has traditionally been
open to the public but has moved off-campus due to recent
student protests.”</p>

<p>“Because we’re locked out of the
meeting, we’ve locked ourselves in his office,” Hunt
says.</p>

<p>Students are also concerned about recent comments by
the University’s Vice Chancellor, Stuart
McCutcheon.</p>

<p>“McCutcheon has stated that he wants the
government to remove the cap on fee increases, which would
create an avalanche of student debt” says Mikaela
Hunt.</p>

<p>The meeting is also where the Vice Chancellor’s
salary is raised. Hunt says it unacceptable that McCutcheon
is the highest paid public official in New Zealand, earning
at least $640,000 per year.</p>

<p>Law student, Jamie Davies,
says she’s worried about leaving university with nearly
$40,000 of debt.</p>

<p>She says, “Around the world students
are organising against fees. German students have recently
forced their government to abolish fees.”</p>

<p>“Stuart
McCutcheon’s generation benefited from fully-funded,
fee-free education. My generation has decades of student
loans to repay.”</p>

<p>Students are chanting, “Sack
Stuart”, “They got it free, why shouldn’t we,”
“Stuart McCutcheon, what’s your function?” “F**k the
fees”.</p>
