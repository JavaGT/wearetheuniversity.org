<p>Students' first-in-family policy needs support </p>

<p><br>Free
education for the first person in a family to undertake
tertiary study is a creative, innovative and transformative
proposal from New Zealand students, says TEU vice-president
Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>Tertiary education is full of new ideas, but
sadly, tertiary education policy is strangely stagnant and
unimaginative. NZUSA’s proposal today though, is a game
changer.</p>

<p>“If we make it easier for families that have
never been in a university or polytechnic we are giving
opportunities and education to the people who can gain the
most and need the most.”</p>

<p>Sandra Grey say all political
parties need to look at NZUSA’s proposal to get new
families into tertiary education and sign up to it new
before the
election.</p>
