<p><b>Students shouldn't need to borrow to
live</b></p>

<p>"To reclaim tertiary education for students we
need to introduce living allowances for all students, and
start working immediately to eliminate student fees."</p>

<p>This
is our line in the sand, said TEU national president Lesley
Francey, at tomorrow afternoon's <i>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga
</i>Wellington launch, which focuses on student debt and on
giving all New Zealanders access to education.</p>

<p>Demands to
reduce the cost of education and remove the financial
barriers to students participating form the basis for TEU's
latest <i>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga</i> blueprint
document.</p>

<p>"Tertiary education is not primarily a public
subsidy and skills factory for big business. It is about
providing opportunities and hope for students and their
local communities. If debt prevents students getting an
education then our public education system is failing and
our country is losing out."</p>

<p>"<i>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga</i>
- our blueprint for education represents that basic line in
the sand."</p>

<p>"And the best way to demonstrate that we are
committing our education system to the wellbeing of students
first and foremost, rather than corporations, is not to
saddle them with huge debts while they study."</p>

<p>TEU will
launch its student well-being blueprint, along with another
blueprint on tertiary education governance, on Tuesday
afternoon to a panel of tertiary education spokespeople
including Dave Clendon (Greens), Hone Harawira (Mana),
Tracey Martin (NZ First), and Grant Robertson
(Labour).

<p><b>Details:</b><br>•	DATE Tues 1
April<br>•	TIME 3.45pm<br>•	VENUE St Johns Church,
Willis St, Wellington<br>•	NOTE: The first <i>Te Kaupapa
Whaioranga </i>document outlined a blueprint to renew the
entire tertiary education sector for the New Zealand public,
and the second focused on the big issues facing Māori
tertiary education. The third and fourth documents, launched
on 1 April cover students and governance. All documents are
