<p>Tertiary strategy is narrow and limiting</p><p>Tertiary
education should support New Zealand businesses, and it
already does. However, that role cannot come at the expense
of the other duties tertiary education has to our
communities and society says TEU national president Lesley
Francey.</p>

<p>“Steven Joyce’s Tertiary Education Strategy
is a narrow and limiting view of tertiary education. It sees
tertiary education’s main role as simply providing a free,
publicly trained workforce and free publicly funded research
to private businesses.”</p>

<p>“The is little space in the
strategy for tertiary education’s many other roles such as
giving local people lifelong learning opportunities,
supporting democracy, strengthening our communities and
standing up as a critic and conscience for important issues
we need to debate as a community."</p>

<p>Lesley Francey says the
minister does not mention polytechnics once in his speech on
the new strategy.</p>

<p>“His narrow focus on the private
returns business can gain from universities has significant
implications for our future education and research. The
Tertiary Education Commission will use this strategy to
direct more money from a shrinking funding pool to only that
education that matters to business. All other the education
which businesses do not want, will be left with a smaller
pool of funding as a result."</p>

<p>“Tertiary education should
be a treasure for all our communities, not simply a subsidy
for businesses that have failed to invest in skills training
or research and
development.”</p>
