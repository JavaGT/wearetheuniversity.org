<p><strong>Public good
research funding at risk under new rules</strong></p>

<p>The
tertiary education minister’s decision to give greater
financial rewards to university research that is already
getting external private funding is a grave mistake says TEU
vice-president Sandra Grey.</p>

<p>“Universities have a role to
research all issues, both those that external agencies are
willing to pay for and those that they are not. There is
some research that business may never want to take place but
is still crucial to the wellbeing of our communities. There
is also blue skies research that may have no immediate
economic benefit but is crucial to our understanding of the
world.”</p>

<p>Sandra Grey says an example of this type of
research is asbestos health research that manufacturers
tried to ignore for many years. A more recent New Zealand
example is research into the water quality of our
rivers.</p>

<p>Steven Joyce, the tertiary education minister,
proposes to increase the proportion of PBRF (contestable
public research funding) allocated based on external
research income, from 15 to 20 percent of the PBRF fund. He
also wants to reward research organisations that attract
external research income. He says ‘this places a higher
value on research that meets user needs’.</p>

<p>“The problem
is that the users of public research are not just those
people who pay for it, but everybody. Just because an
external agency does not want to pay for research does not
mean it is less worthwhile than other research. In fact, it
may be more important. And the only way it will be funded is
publicly through the PBRF
system.”</p>
