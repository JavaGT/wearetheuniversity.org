         Cuts to Māori research centre a travesty</p><p></p><p><br>Cutting
the funding to Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga centre of research
excellence is a travesty and tragedy says Dr Margaret
Taurere.</p><p>Dr Taurere is speaking on behalf of Māori
tertiary education workers who gathered from around the
country and passed a resolution today expressing their
concern at the decision.</p><p>Earlier this week Ngā Pae o te
Maramatanga learned it was one of four established centres
of research excellence (CoREs) that would lose their funding
from the Tertiary Education Commission next year. The
Auckland-based Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga leads
internationally respected research into Māori
communities.</p><p>“Ngā Pae is a renowned beacon of success,
both for Māori academia and for the wider Māori community,
which benefits from its work,” said Dr Taurere.</p><p>Māori
members of TEU passed a resolution at their annual hui today
at Whangārei’s Te Puna ō Te Mātauranga Marae. The
resolution calls for the Tertiary Education Commission to
reconsider the Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga funding application
immediately, because for Ngā Pae not to receive funding
will detrimentally affect established and emerging Māori
researchers, Kaupapa Māori and mātauranga Māori research
outputs.</p><p>Dr Taurere says it is hard to imagine how Ngā
Pae o te Maramatanga failed to meet the criteria for
funding. She and the rest of the Hui are meeting with Māori
politicians at 5pm at Te Puna ō Te Mātauranga Marae to
express their
concerns.</p><p>ends
