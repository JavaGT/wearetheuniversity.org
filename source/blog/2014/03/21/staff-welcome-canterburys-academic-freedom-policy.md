         Media release<br>21 March 2014<br>Tertiary Education Union -
Te Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p><strong>Staff welcome
Canterbury’s academic freedom policy</strong></p><p>The
Tertiary Education Union at the University of Canterbury
welcomes the new Academic Freedom Policy</p><p>TEU’s
Canterbury Branch President Prof. Jack Heinemann is
delighted that the university’s council has demonstrated
its commitment to academic freedom through this
policy.</p><p>“At a time when university governance is under
threat from central government it is more important than
ever that all in the sector speak out on important
issues,” said Heinemann.</p><p>The Education Act expects both
academic staff and students at universities to serve as
responsible critics and conscience of society.</p><p>“It is an
important social safeguard for society. This group of
scholars is meant to speak truth to power, whatever form
that power takes.”</p><p>There are no incentives for this
critical activity, despite it potentially putting scholars
at risk.</p><p>“The critic and conscience role is not
optional. It is a duty of the tertiary education community.
It needs to be better recognised and supported.”</p><p>
“Students expect that their instructors will be
well-informed and capable of engaging with controversial
issues of the day. Society expects that those same
instructors and researchers will look after all interests,
not just the government’s, industry’s or pressure
groups’.</p><p> “I see this policy as a necessary step to
normalise responsible dissent, and support academics to
engage with the broader public in New Zealand,” said
Heinemann.</p><p></p><p>
