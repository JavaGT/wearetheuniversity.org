<p>Lincoln cleaners outsourced</p>

<p><br>Lincoln University will
outsource its staff to an as yet undecided cleaning company,
but TEU organiser Cindy Doull says it’s not worth it, and
what money the university might save is
negligible.</p>

<p>“We’re disappointed that the university
decided do this while we were in discussions with them about
becoming a Living Wage employer.”</p>

<p>Cindy Doull says the
plan to outsource the cleaners simply moves the money the
university spends from one pot ‘salaries’ to another pot
‘operational’.</p>

<p>“The only way outsourcing saves a big
organisation like Lincoln University any money is if the
contracted cleaning company cuts wages or hours. It’s a
coward’s way of cutting pay and conditions for our lowest
paid workers.”</p>

<p>If the new cleaning company does cut its
cleaning staff’s pay the money the university saves will
be very little, says Cindy Doull, and it will do nothing to
address the university’s financial troubles.</p>

<p>The
university announced its decision yesterday after it
finished consulting on its change proposal for Lincworks
Property Services. As well as outsourcing its cleaners, the
university also intends to disestablish an electrical
coordinator, an electrician and a systems administrator. The
proposal establishes four new positions and makes changes to
eight other existing jobs.  </p>

<p>Cindy Doull says the decision
is particularly significant for some long-serving
cleaners.</p>

<p>“Some have chosen early retirement as they are
so distraught, and do not want to work for anyone else. They
felt that they had no
choice.”</p>
