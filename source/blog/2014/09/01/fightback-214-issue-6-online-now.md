<p><strong></strong></p><center><h3><strong>Fightback 2014 issue #6 online
now</strong><br></h3> by <a href="http://fightback.org.nz/author/hugefan/" target="_blank">Fightback Admin</a><br>1 September 2014
</center><a href="http://fightback.org.nz/2014/08/29/fightback-2014-issue-6-online-now/" target="_blank"></a><p>This special, expanded election
edition of <i>Fightback</i> magazine comes at what seems to
be a turning point in the 2014 election. The shockwaves from
<i>Dirty Politics</i>, Nicky Hager's exposé of the possibly
corrupt relations between National Party cabinet ministers
and the tabloid attack blog “Whale Oil”, are still
reverberating. Labour and the left opposition parties want
answers; John Key is stonewalling, and even the conservative
press seem to realise something has gone wrong.</p>

<p>Daphne
Lawless' contribution discusses this in terms of
“anti-politics from above” in New Zealand – a
neoliberal-inspired political strategy to use smear and
negativity to demoralise activists and deliberately depress
voting turnout. Ben Peterson takes on the same issue as an
attempted undermining of democracy itself. National lost
under Don Brash in 2005 because he allowed the naked, nasty
face of neoliberalism to assert itself. The project goes
much more smoothly under John Key, the “relaxed” and
cheerful frontman, who plays at being an “ordinary
bloke” who just happened to make $50 million in currency
speculation. Meanwhile, big corporates dictate policy, and
cronies and friends like Cameron Slater and Jason Ede play
the politics of personal destruction.<p>
<p>Will Hager's
revelation of the naked face of attack politics behind
National's carefully bland façade damage their prospects
for a third term? A lot depends on the other conservative
parties. Cameron Slater is explicitly quoted in the book as
saying that, if MMP stays and the small parties of the Right
fall out of Parliament, “National is f**ked”. Byron
Clark looks at the centre-right as a whole and examines its
prospects.<br>What is the alternative, though? As Ian
Anderson ably explains in his article, Labour offers a
kinder, gentler face to the same old management of
neo-liberalism. While Labour no longer shuns the Green
Party, this can only be because the Greens themselves have
moved inside the “big tent” of accepting neoliberal
corporate politics – the left wing of the establishment,
the party of comfortable but socially conscious small
business and successful professionals.</p>

<p>So under what
circumstances can a socialist organisation like Fightback
– pushing for a fundamental transformation of relations of
work, production and power throughout society – support an
alliance of the <i>tino rangatiratanga</i> / broad left MANA
movement with the upstart Internet Party, founded by a
German millionaire with an outlandish personality? Fightback
works within MANA because of its commitment to represent te
pani me te rawakore [the poor and the dispossessed]. We are
able to keep working because it is a democratic party –
when the leadership is wrong, it is willing to listen to
activists; and because no real change in Aotearoa-New
Zealand is possible without the most intimate involvement of
the tangata whenua.</p>

<p>But to some degree MANA represents
“traditional” constituencies for the radical left. The
Internet Party, in contrast, aims at the young and the
wired. Although funded by Kim Dotcom, the party is led by
activists of the traditional social-democratic Left such as
leader Laila Harré, and kept moving by younger activists
such as Miriam Pierard, who is interviewed extensively in
this issue. While not attracted to a “traditional”
socialist programme, these young people – according to
Pierard – have a strong belief in civil liberties, social
equality, freedom of information and an antipathy to
corporate power. Traditional politics has had nothing to say
to them until now.</p>

<p>It is precisely the Internet Party and
MANA Movement's constituencies which the strategy of Whale
Oil and his co-thinkers want to keep out of politics
altogether. They want electoral choice restricted to, at the
extreme, the now rather tame Green Party. The Internet-MANA
alliance aims at complementary audiences with the same
vision seen from two perspectives. With current polls
showing five MPs to be elected from this alliance, this is
the best chance since the 1990s for those excluded from the
“rock-star” neoliberal economy to vote for an
alternative. Fightback encourages all readers to take that
chance.</p>
