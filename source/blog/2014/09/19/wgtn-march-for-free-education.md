<p><strong>WGTN: March for free education </strong></p>

<p>Fightback Admin</p>

<p>We are students,
university staff, and members of the community. Whichever
parties form a government after September 20th, we are
demanding an end to corporatisation of education.</p>

<p>We
demand:</p>

<p>* Fully funded public education<br>* A Universal
Student Allowance, cancellation of all existing student
debt<br>* Bridging courses and support for people entering
tertiary education<br>* Living Wage for all staff<br>*
Student and staff representation in planning education
policy<br>* A move away from funding primarily targeted
towards marketable research, towards funding all socially
valuable forms of education and research</p>

<p>Meeting at the
VUW Campus Hub for a student and staff forum, before
marching onwards (to parliament? National Party offices?
Ministry of Education? Participants will determine our final
destination).</p>

<p>Event called by Reclaim Vic, endorsed by
Tertiary Education Union.</p>

<p>Campus Hub | 1pm | Friday 26th
September<br>[Facebook
event]<p>
