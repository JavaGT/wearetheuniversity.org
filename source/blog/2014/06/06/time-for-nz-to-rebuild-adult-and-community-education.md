<p><b>Time for NZ to rebuild adult and community
education</b></p>

<p>"We need to re-commit to fair and equitable
support to adult and community education in all our
communities," says TEU National President Lesley
Francey.</p>

<p>Adult and community education funding has been
under attack since at least the mid-1980s. The current
government has made significant cuts to the ACE budget,
which has seen a fall in community education provision from
200,000 in 2009 to 75,000 in 2010.</p>

<p>"New Zealand was a
world leader in adult and community education, with ACE
being an integral part of our education since at least
1915."</p>

<p>"From its inception, ACE has had a vital role to
play in igniting or re-igniting our desire to learn,
particularly for those New Zealanders who missed the
opportunity to participate in education beyond the
compulsory sector, for rural communities, for adult
learners, and for new migrants."</p>

<p>The value of lifelong
learning must be properly recognised through legislation and
funding to ensure that the ACE sector, and other sectors,
are adequately funded to continue providing a range of
learning opportunities for our diverse
communities.</p>
