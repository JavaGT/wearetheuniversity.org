         <strong>Press release - [07:00pm 19/08/2014] –
</strong><br><strong>For Immediate
Use</strong><br><strong></strong><br>PRESS RELEASE: Reclaim
UoA</p><p><strong>Students Interrupt Steven Joyce at University
Event</strong></p><p>A group of 30 students this evening
interrupted an event about ‘the future of tertiary
education’ at which Tertiary Education Minister Steven
Joyce was slated to speak. As Joyce began to speak, students
interrupted with a speech of their own. </p><p>Mikaela Hunt, a
representative of Reclaim UoA, says “We wanted to
highlight the disconnect between the current government’s
policy and the lived experiences of students.” </p><p>The
actions of this tertiary education minister, including
cutting student allowance for postgraduates, time limits on
student loan availability, and the proposed changes to
university councils came under fire by the group.</p><p>‘We
decided to propose an alternative education policy, based on
inclusiveness, equality and fully funded, fee free tertiary
education. We see this as entirely possible when, annually,
it would cost less than half of the tax cut this government
gave to the top ten percent of New Zealanders,’ Mikaela
Hunt.</p><p>The Tertiary Education Minister was visibly
flustered by the interruption, and told the students to
‘keep their heads down.’ </p><p>Hunt says, ‘We felt it was
appropriate for those who make up the university --
students, staff and community members -- to speak at this
event. We believe the tertiary education minister has no
mandate to speak on behalf of these
groups.’</p><p>ENDS<br>
