         National Student Day of Action</p><p><br>Friday 15th of August
is a National Student Day of Action. Reclaim University of Auckland, Blockade the Budget and We are the University (Akl) are
standing together against the corporatisation of the
university. This Day of Action is held in conjunction with
students in Wellington and Christchurch.</p><p><br>Student action has
been an essential part of changes in discourse throughout
New Zealand history. From opposition to apartheid to
standing alongside Ngāti Whātua at Bastion Point, students
from each generation have helped to push New Zealand towards
becoming a more progressive society.  This  generation of
students is defined by burgeoning debt, the lack of student
and staff control over the university and our university’s
academic co-operation with the oppressive Israeli regime.
Seeking to combat this and reclaim the role of the
university as the 'critic and conscience of society',
students across the nation are coordinating a joint effort
to regain control of our education.</p><p><br>At our day of
action, Auckland students are asking where our university
fees are going:

<p><br>	When more than one hundred jobs are
being 'restructured' for admin staff through the Faculty
Administrative Review (FAR)?</p><p>	When our Vice-chancellor
is the highest paid public official in
Aotearoa, earning $660,000 per year?</p><p>	When the University
of Auckland is expected to become the first billion
dollar tertiary institution?</p><p>	When cleaners and other
support staff are not paid a living wage or given secure
contracts?</p><p>	When academics are supporting colonial
oppression and apartheid by publishing in partnership with
Israeli academics and not supporting BDS?</p><p>	When the
politicians making austerity cuts to education received a fully funded tertiary education?</p><p>	When
the university doesn’t hold the NZ Police to account for
<a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1207/S00082/ipca-investigates-police-action-at-budget-protest.htm" target="_blank">brutalising its students,</a> or call out
the IPCA for failing to respond to an official complaint
after <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1405/S00233/students-angry-about-lack-of-progress-on-ipca-investigation.htm" target="_blank">two years</a>?</p><p>	When the already minimal
student, staff and community representation on University
Councils is being undermined in favour of corporate
interests?</p><p>	When fully funded, fee
free tertiary education is entirely possible?</p><p>	<br>If
you want answers to these questions, join us on the 15th of
August at 12pm at the University of Auckland Business
School.</p><p></p><p><br>ends<!-- LINKS REMOVED
