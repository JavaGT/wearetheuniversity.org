         11 February 2014</p><p><b>Minister attacks uni and wānanga
council democracy</b></p><p>Steven Joyce’s announcement today
that he will reduce the size of the governing councils at
universities and wānanga, and remove seats from local
staff, students, and community members is a power grab, says
TEU president Lesley Francey.</p><p>“He is wresting control of
universities and wānanga into the hands of his own
ministerial appointees and of business
supporters.”</p><p>“As the minister notes himself, New
Zealand’s universities and wānanga are already
financially stable and perform well internationally. There
is no justification for these proposals, other than
silencing local community voices that do not support the
minister’s own economic vision,” said Lesley
Francey.</p><p>“We regard any move to replace locally-elected
and chosen community, staff and student representatives with
a council made of ministerial appointees and business
leaders as an attack on democracy and on academic
freedom,” said Lesley
Francey.</p><p>ENDS
