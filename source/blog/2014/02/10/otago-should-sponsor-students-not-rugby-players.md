         Media release<br>10 February 2014<br>Tertiary Education
Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa</p><p><strong>Otago
should sponsor students not rugby players</strong></p><p>“The
University of Otago’s sponsorship of the Highlanders rugby
team had better not come at the expense of public education
and research,” say TEU deputy secretary Nanette
Cormack.</p><p>“We do not know how much the university will
spend promoting itself to rugby fans, but we do believe that
money the public gives to public education institutions
should be spent on public education and research, not on
advertising.”</p><p>“Tertiary education has suffered
significant funding cuts in recent years. It seems
ridiculous that a publicly-owned New Zealand university
would believe that competing with other public universities
for students is a funding priority. It should be investing
in keep student fees down, lowering class sizes or bring
high quality research and teaching to the people of
Otago.”</p><p><br>ENDS<br>
