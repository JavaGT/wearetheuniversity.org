         Terrorism bill fraught with risk for academics</p><p>Academics
studying terrorism, or other topics that the SIS considers
not to be in the national interest, could be among those who
lose civil rights if an ‘anti-terrorism’ bill becomes
law.</p><p>TEU, the union representing tertiary education staff,
says the bill is flawed and it gives unwarranted powers to
security agencies - powers that could be used to spy on
academics.</p><p>The University of Victoria’s Dr Sandra Grey says the bill could have
a chilling effect not just on some academics’ willingness
to speak out publicly, but it could also limit the type of
research and teaching they are willing to undertake. Dr Grey
researches the silencing effect government policy can have
on people’s participation in democracy.</p><p>Professor Richard Jackson, Deputy Director at the
National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, says not
only does the bill contradict existing academic research on
effective counterterrorism measures, but it will potentially
impede much-needed research into countering violent
extremism. In particular, it will negatively affect Muslim
students and staff, he says. Sadly, this bill is likely to
be counterproductive to the government’s stated goals of
increasing long-term security for New Zealand. Professor
Jackson is a leading scholar in the field of critical
terrorism studies.

<p>Massey University’s Associate
Professor Jeff Sluka says the bill is completely
unnecessary legislation. "The police and the SIS already
have extensive powers. The proposed powers are draconian.
The government has given no evidence to justify why we need
the changes. If instituted, these powers will put a pall
over young academics, discouraging them from studying
political violence." Associate Professor Sluka studies state
terror and armed independence movements around the
world.</p><p>The University of Canterbury’s Dr David Small says serious questions
remain unanswered about what information about New
Zealanders is shared with overseas intelligence agencies.
"The New Zealand public has a right to expect that its
security and intelligence agencies will act within the law,
and that those in charge of these agencies will exercise
proper oversight and not abuse their position. Until then,
there should be no increase in the powers or resources of
these agencies." Dr Small's research areas include civil
liberties, the rule of law and the war on
terror.</p><p></p><p>ends<!-- LINKS REMOVED
