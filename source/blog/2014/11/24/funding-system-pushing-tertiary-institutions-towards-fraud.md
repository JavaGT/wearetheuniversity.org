         Funding system pushing tertiary institutions towards
fraud</p><p>Pressure for funding is driving institutions to take
illegal shortcuts says TEU national president Lesley
Francey.</p><p>News that the tertiary education minister Steven
Joyce is investigating alleged fraud of at least
$10 million from public tertiary education is shocking, but
it is the outcome of the financial pressure institutions
find themselves under, says Lesley Francey.</p><p>Lesley Francey
says that tertiary institutions are paid for enrolling and
passing students rather than for the quality of the
education they provide. Institutions are punished
financially if they do not enrol enough students, and are
punished financially if those students do not pass. The
result is pressure to take students that might otherwise do
better in a different course, and pressure them to pass
those students.</p><p>"This fraud is one manifestation of a
funding system that constantly pressures institutions to
teach more students with less money. Other symptoms include
mass redundancies, growing class sizes and course
closures."</p><p>"If these allegations are true, they are
deplorable. The minister and his officials must catch the
culprits and remove them from the system. Then he and his
officials must take action to minimise the pressure on
institutions to cheat. A good funding system should reward
quality and collaboration, not cheating," said Lesley
Francey.</p><p></p><p>ends
