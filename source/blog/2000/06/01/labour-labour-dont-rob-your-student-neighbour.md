<p>"Labour, Labour!  Don"t  Rob Your Student
Neighbour!"</p>

<p>Students boarded the Education Freedom Bus
from Waikato University and rode  it into Hamilton town,
flags and banners flying out the window, where they joined
friends from Waikato Polytech protesting outside Labour MP
Dianne Yates' office.</p>

<p>"Dianne Yates and Labour- Don't rob
your student neighbour" went up the call  from the fifty
strong picket, protesting that the very Labour MPs who tell
us today that free education is unrealistic, benifitted
themselves from it when they were young.</p>

<p>"They say
Tomorrow- we say fake! They say borrow..We say take!" was
the crowd's response to Steve Maharey's promise of gradual
change over the next three terms of government, changes so
slow that they condemn  another generation to nine years of
increasing fees, loans and student debt.</p>

<p>Cllr Dave Mac
Pherson from the Alliance party said he was proud to be with
the picket protesting outside Labour offices, and reiterated
Alliance's  commitment to the fight for free education. 
"There is widespread support from the community for your
demands, and grassroots pressure is the only way  to shift
this government" he said to applause.  Cllr Dave has
consistently supported the fight for Free Education in the
Waikato, visiting occupiers of  the University's registry in
their occupation last March.</p>

<p>Taking a leaf from the trade
union tradition, the students embarked on a Flying Picket,
taking their message with lightening speed to the Department
of Education, Labour MP Martin Gallagher's office and the
central WINZ  office.<p>
<p>At Gallagher's office, they were
greeted by his office staff, two women who  sympathised with
the protest and hoped that the national Labour party would 
do something about student debt.  "My son's loan has just
gone past forty thousand dollars" one said to the protest,
when the picket put it to Labour  that the cap on interest
on tuition fees (whilst studying) was not good  enough.</p>

<p>A
huge loans statement was burned outside Labour offices by
its owner  Heather.   Many of the placards carried made it
clear that students were in  "Can't Pay- Won't Pay" spirits,
the most popular being the socialist "F@#K FEES!  Tell Helen
to tax the rich for free education". One student, Ben, held
his own placard- "Helen, there is no way you're  getting the
$40,000 dollars I'll owe" and signed it with his student ID 
number!</p>

<p>WINZ got the pounding it deserved, police moving
in to protect the hated institution as its windows were
thumped by fists and hit by placards.  Joe Carolan from the
Socialist Workers Organisation insisted that "this year is 
the last that students will endure the disastorous WINZ
student loans  scheme.  We need a Universal Student Living
Allowance now- get the message,  Labour!  Fire Christine
Rankin, reinstate the Emergency Dole now, and get WINZ out
of the student poverty industry.  Education is a right for
all, not  a privilege for the wealthy few".</p>

<p>In high
spirits, the Flying Picket continued its flight to Hamilton
City Council offices, where local politicians were reminded
that user pays was a  disaster.  It landed at the Waikato
Polytech to cheers from students on  campus, who are to host
the next Hui for Free Education on their Marae the weekend
of July 1st/2nd.  Its speed, colour and spirit outwitted the
local plod footed constabulary, and closed WINZ, the
Department of Education and Labour offices for the
day.</p>

<p>The protest also send out messages of solidarity to
the 116 staff facing redundancy in Palmerston North, with
the announcement on Monday of  significant "restructuring"
because of falling student enrolements. "Massey says
cutback- we say fightback!" finished off the day with the 
message of Solidarity, and students in Waikato resolved to
support whatever  action the AUS and staff at Massey take to
defend their jobs- "If staff strike- we'll
occupy!"</p>
