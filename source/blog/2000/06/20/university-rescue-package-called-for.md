<p>The Victoria University
branch of the Association of University Staff (AUS)
responded today to sobering news concerning the University's
financial situation with a call for reasoned and
constructive analyses of the available options.<p>

<p>AUS
spokesperson, Guy Reynolds, said staff appreciated the more
consultative approach being adopted by the Acting
Vice-Chancellor after last year's difficulties.  "At least
this year we are being presented with a rationale and a
process which will allow for effective staff input into the
decision making," said Mr Reynolds.<p>

<p>"It is good to see
that Victoria's management, unlike Massey’s, is not just
expressing the budget deficit in terms of the number of jobs
that need to be shed," said Mr Reynolds.<p>

<p>“We welcome the
fact that the University proposes to investigate possible
reductions in its overhead and management costs and the
recognition that it needs to focus on core teaching and
research activities.<p>

<p>“If the ideas and expertise of the
University community are successfully utilised new
revenue-earning initiatives should be able to be
implemented," he said.<p>

<p>While there were internal
initiatives that Victoria must undertake, Mr Reynolds said
that the Government needs to act faster and with greater
commitment if the university sector is to survive at
all.</p>

<p>“The recent funding announced in the Budget may help
to arrest further rises in student fees but does not even
compensate for inflation, let alone go far enough to meet
the needs of a seriously under-funded sector.<p>
<p>“Government needs to ensure that student fees drop from the
current level of 35% of course costs to the 25% originally
set down by the Todd Task Force, said Guy Reynolds."<p>

<p>"If
the Government truly wants to create a knowledge-based
society, then it needs to look seriously at the kind of
rescue package allocated to the Arts. We need to ensure
throughout this challenging period that we keep the best
long-term interests of the University, its students and the
wider community firmly in view," he said.<p>
