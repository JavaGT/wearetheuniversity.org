Budget was claimed to be about "Fairness, security, and
opportunity", Neville Blampied, AUS National President, said
in Christchurch today that "This positive spin on the Budget
is beginning to sound very hollow for university staff. 
Financial crises at several universities, including Massey
University and Victoria University mean that fairness,
security and opportunity are fast disappearing for many
people working in our universities.<p>

<p>“Unless there is
decisive action, more university staff will be made
redundant from New Zealand's universities in the first year
of the Labour-Alliance government than in our entire
history.</p>

<p>"University staff are not to blame for these
crises," said Neville Blampied.<p>

<p>"They did not
systematically reduce funding per student, create vicious
competition between institutions, appoint incompetent
managers, nor cause the current downturn in student numbers.
Yet they bear the painful costs in severe stress, constant
restructurings, large-scale redundancies, and destruction of
career opportunities."</p>

<p>“AUS members at Victoria will be
working with senior administrators to seek long-term
solutions to the university's problems. Because the problems
cannot be solved just by local initiatives, AUS is also
seeking a joint meeting between staff, students, management,
the University Council and the responsible Government
Ministers.<p>
<p>"The Government has set the Tertiary Education
Advisory Commission (TEAC) up to advise it on the strategic
direction for the tertiary education sector" Neville
Blampied said.<p>

<p>"While TEAC does its work, the Government
has a responsibility to maintain the status quo in the
university sector, otherwise the integrity of the TEAC
process is called seriously into question."</p>

<p>“We urge the
Government to take whatever remedial action is necessary to
maintain the status quo pending the initial report of TEAC. 
Returning the $62.5 million arbitrarily removed from the
sector in 1998 in response to the Asian financial crisis
would be a good start!”</p>
