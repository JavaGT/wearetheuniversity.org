University Staff (AUS) representatives briefed Deputy Prime
Minister and Alliance Leader, Jim Anderton, on Massey
University's controversial 'repositioning' and cost-cutting
project yesterday.</p>

<p>"We were keen to ask Mr Anderton's
views on regional development and the place of regional
universities in the promotion and support of the
Government's policies for regional growth.  In our view,
Massey University's proposed job cuts for the Palmerston
North campuses are totally out of step with these policies,"
said AUS Massey Branch President Associate Professor Tony
Lewis.</p>

<p>"We have sought the support of Mr Anderton,
Palmerston North MP, Steve Maharey, and Minister of
Education, Trevor Mallard, in ensuring that Massey
University Council and management clearly understand the
Government’s tertiary education and regional development
policies and their implications for Massey’s ‘repositioning’
and cost-cutting project," said Professor Lewis.<p>

<p>"We
believe that Mr Anderton understands the issues raised by
the Massey ‘repositioning’ and shares our concern about the
impact on the Manawatu region.</p>

<p>“We anticipate that, as
Minister of Economic Development, Mr Anderton will closely
monitor these developments. We are hopeful that our meeting
will have positive benefits for staff, students, the
University and the region," said Professor Lewis.</p>
