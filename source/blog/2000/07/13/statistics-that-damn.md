University Staff (AUS) has today deplored the findings of a
report into university funding in New Zealand.  Guy Scott’s
report on funding in New Zealand universities since 1980
shows an annual decline of 2.3% per student in real terms
over that 20-year period.</p><p>AUS President, Neville Blampied,
said in Wellington today that successive New Zealand
Governments had used an argument based on the private
benefit that students received from their tertiary education
to reduce savagely the amount of taxpayer subsidy per
student.</p><p>“The report shows that funding for each student
in a New Zealand university has reduced on average by one
third in real terms over the past two decades,” said Neville
Blampied.</p><p>“One of the associated costs for students has
been an increase in the student:staff ratio of 50% during
this same period, meaning that students are not able to
access quality time with teaching staff.  This is emphasised
further by the damning statistic that since 1994, the
proportion of academic staff in New Zealand universities has
dropped from 45% of all staff to 40%.</p><p>“The average
student:staff ratio in 1998 for New Zealand universities was
18.4:1.  This would put the New Zealand system in line with
the bottom 4 of Britain’s 96 universities.  The median
student:staff ratio in Britain is 12.3:1.</p><p>“The recent
budget announcement of a 2.3% increase for 2001 provided
institutions hold their fee levels constant will do nothing
to rescue the system or reverse the funding cut trends
identified by Guy Scott’s research,” said Neville Blampied. 
</p><p>“Treasury is predicting that inflation will be 2.3% in
2001 and some commercial commentators are suggesting a rate
closer to
3%.<br>
