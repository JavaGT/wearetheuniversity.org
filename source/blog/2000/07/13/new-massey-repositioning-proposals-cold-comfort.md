senior management released the second draft of their
controversial 'repositioning' and cost cutting
recommendations to staff today.  The new proposals detail
the loss of 86 full time equivalent positions mainly on the
Palmerston North Turitea campus.</p>

<p>"The new recommendations
are cold comfort to staff who are angry about the
'repositioning' project and the continuing uncertainty they,
and their families, are expected to cope with.  Senior
management's insistence on pursuing this discredited project
in the face of staff, student and community opposition
continues to damage Massey University's reputation." said
Association of University Staff (AUS) Massey Branch
President Associate Professor Tony Lewis.</p>

<p>"The AUS put a
credible alternative to this divisive process to the Vice
Chancellor last month.  In our view this alternative process
would allow staff to produce a set of recommendations for
the creation of a vibrant and innovative University as
opposed to a restructured, retrenched and resentful
organisation.  We will continue to push this alternative to
University Council who make the final decisions on the 4th
of August," said Professor Lewis.</p>

<p>"The reduction in the
number of redundancies from 116 full time equivalent
positions to 86, is a minor concession from the senior
management and should do nothing to quell the concerns of
the Palmerston North community in particular.  The cost of
these redundancies to the community is in the order of a
direct loss of approximately $4 million in salaries after
tax, with annual flow on effects of $20 million.‚Äù<p>
<p>"AUS
representatives are meeting with Deputy Prime Minister, Jim
Anderton, today to brief him on the 'repositioning' and in
particular the likely effects of the forced redundancies to
the region's development.  It is important that all the
effects of this type of restructuring are widely canvassed,"
said Professor Lewis.</p>
