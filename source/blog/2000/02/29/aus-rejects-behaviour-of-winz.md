<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>Work and Income New
Zealand (WINZ) staff are exceeding their authority and
breaching ethical standards by making comments to students
about the suitability of courses of study, according to the
Canterbury Branch of the Association of University Staff
(AUS).</p>

<p>Compounding general concerns about the processing
of student loan applications by WINZ, the AUS has received
complaints from students that some WINZ staff are making
disparaging judgements about the suitability of University
courses.<p>

<p>AUS Canterbury Branch President, Dr Maureen
Montgomery, has cited one example where a student was
questioned why he wanted to enroll in American Studies by a
WINZ staff member and told that an alternative course would
offer better career prospects.</p>

<p>“Similarly, other students,
particularly those enrolling in arts courses, have met with
derisory comments about the value of those degrees and their
suitability for post-university employment. Some have been
further questioned about how they expect to be able to repay
a student loan with such a degree,” said Dr
Montgomery.</p>

<p>One WINZ staff member, for example, described
sociology to an enrolling student as a “waffly subject” in a
conversation about the low commercial value of a social
sciences degree.</p>

<p>“WINZ staff are neither qualified nor
employed to make judgements about the value of any
university degree”, said Dr Montgomery. “In light of their
own performance in the current student loan fiasco they
would be more usefully employed in concentrating on their
own levels of competence before turning their attention
elsewhere”.</p>
