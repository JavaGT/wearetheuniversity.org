<p>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government
announcement of an increase in the tuition subsidy for
dental students at Otago University.</p>

<p>AUS President,
Neville Blampied, said in Christchurch today that the
Association welcomed the injection of fairness and common
sense involved.</p>

<p>“We are encouraged by this change in
policy direction and look forward to a full review of the
level of all course tuition subsidies once the proposed
Tertiary Education Advisory Commission is established,” said
Mr Blampied.</p>
