<p>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government
announcement of an increase in the tuition subsidy for

Neville Blampied, said in Christchurch today that the
Association welcomed the injection of fairness and common
sense involved.</p>

<p>“We are encouraged by this change in
policy direction and look forward to a full review of the
level of all course tuition subsidies once the proposed
Tertiary Education Advisory Commission is established,” said
Mr Blampied.</p>
