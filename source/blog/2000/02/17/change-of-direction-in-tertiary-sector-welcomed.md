<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the new direction in
tertiary education policy signalled by the Associate
Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, in Wellington
today.</p>

<p>AUS President, Neville Blampied, said in Wellington
today that it was enormously encouraging that the future
needs of New Zealand as a knowledge society would be
determined through a policy process that was collaborative,
consultative and visionary.</p>

<p>“AUS strongly supports the
concept of policy recommendations being made by a small
group of well-informed, bro
strategic vision” he said.</p>

<p>“The establishment of the
Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) by the new
Government means a move away from a narrow view that
tertiary education needed no planning because the ‘market”
would determine policy direction.”</p>

<p>“Further, it promises a
move to a co-operative and collaborative sector and away
from the destructive competitive model that has prevailed
for the past decade,” said Mr Blampied.</p>

<p>“We are especially
pleased that the Government is committed to giving the TEAC
an independent position in public sector structures and look
forward to working with the members of TEAC and its
secretariat once it is established.”</p>
