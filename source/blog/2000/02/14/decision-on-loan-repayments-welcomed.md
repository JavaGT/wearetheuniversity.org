<p>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government’s
announcement that part-time students on low incomes will
qualify for a full write-off on their student loan, if their
annual income is lower than $24,596.</p>

<p>“From the inception
of the student loan scheme, the Association has been
critical of the threshold at which loans repayments
commence,” said AUS President, Neville Blampied, in
Wellington today.</p>

<p>“The Government’s decision fits well
with a philosophy of encouraging life-long learning and
retraining for new employment possibilities.”</p>

<p>“Growth in
university enrolments has ceased and it is imperative for
the future of New Zealand that all aspects of the loan
scheme and student allowance provision are re-evaluated,
along with Government funding for tertiary education.”</p>

<p>“We
see this as the primary task of the Tertiary Education
Advisory Commission, which the Government has promised to
establish,” said Mr Blampied.</p>
