<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has urged Victoria University to take
a cautious approach to proposed lay-offs in the Faculty of
Humanities.</p>

<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier,
acknowledged that Victoria University had been severely
penalised by the changes to postgraduate student funding
that had been made in the last Budget.</p>

<p>“The present
Government, however, is committed to a review of the funding
system and will shortly be establishing a Tertiary Education
Advisory Commission to assist with such a review.</p>

<p>“The
Government has also promised a move away from the
competitive market model in tertiary education.  The
Association therefore challenges Victoria to re-evaluate its
priorities and reduce its expenditure on marketing and
public relations before cutting the core business of the
university,” said Mr Crozier.</p>
