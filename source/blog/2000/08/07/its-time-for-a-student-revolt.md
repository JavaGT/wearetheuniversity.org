<p>It's time
for a STUDENT REVOLT</p>

<p>by Joe Carolan, Waikato Occupation
activist</p>

<p>After taking stock over the holiday period, the
student movement for Free Education is preparing for another
term of action, with groups at Waikato, Wellington and
Massey already preparing to fight.  Recent events have shown
how little is really on offer from the Labour led coalition,
and a lot of the illusions that students had in the new
government have been sorely let down.  The Fightback
movement that took  simultaneous action for nationwide
occupations earlier this year has led to  the reinvigoration
of student activism on these campuses, who warned that the
Labour party were not going to tackle the huge crisis in
education.  This has been borne out in recent weeks
with-</p>

<p>1.  An admission from Steve Maharey's office that
they are not prepared to process student loans in 2001, with
the result that the WINZ disaster will be repeated, leaving
thousands of students without money for food or rent at  the
beginning of the next academic year.  Fightback, the
national campaign for Free Education, demands the abolition
of loans and the introduction of a  Universal Student Living
Allowance, to avoid this man made crisis.<p>
<p>2.  Statements
from tertiary institutions, staff unions and NZUSA that the
2.3% increase in funding offered by Labour will not be
enough to stop cutbacks, staff layoffs and course closures. 
This derisory increase will not keep up with inflation, and
fees will dramatically increase in 2002.  The cap is a cop
out, a band aid on the fleshwound of student debt, now
reaching the $4 billion mark.  It is a cynical short term 
fix to temporarily freeze fees, which will lead to disaster
down the line. Fightback demands proper funding of tertiary
institutions, research and  staff by taxing the rich top 5%
of society, who benifitted in corporate tax  breaks from
cutbacks in public services like health and education.</p>

<p>3. 
Reality.  Already the knife is falling at Victoria and
Massey, where shortfalls in funding are leading to job
losses and course closures.  Victoria is cutting back on $8
million worth of courses and staff- Massey is  firing 114
lecturers in what management newspeak calls "repositioning".
There are signs that this could be the spark to ignite the
fire of  solidarity between students and staff, with the
possibility that industrial  action could be backed by
student occupations.  If this were to happen,  other campus
activist groups under the Fightback banner would agitate for
solidarity action on their campus, and the cutbacks would be
made into a national issue for the government.</p>

<p>The
illusions in the new Labour government are wearing away, and
more and more students are realising that they will have to
fight just as they did under National.  Last year's mass
occupation at Canterbury triggered occupations in Auckland
and Victoria, and were the inspiration for  the movement to
plan nationwide simultaneous occupations for free education 
at the end of March.  The mood on Waikato campus has been
transformed- the Fightback group there are organising "The
Cap is a Cop Out" protest against  the 2.3% offer, and are
leading the campaign for a Universal Union  membership that
will see a fighting union on campus. The rightwingers who
introduced voluntary unionism are widely seen as self
serving profiteers, who privatised student assets, and left
students without collective defense  against fee increases
and poverty. There is hope that a victory on the  Universal
campaign will see a return to fighting unionism on
Campus.</p>

<p>Staff and students at Massey have joined in
action, marching against the 114  job losses, rediscovering
the scottish tradition of "waysailing" their  arrogant
management.  Villagers would surround the house of a
tyrannical landlord at night, and shame him through song all
night.  The clearances have come to Massey- staff threatened
with the chop should also rediscover the scottish tradition
of the Red Clydeside, strike and occupy their  workplace,
backed by student occupation. A joint staff/student
occupation would be inspirational throughout Aotearoa, and
it would put real pressure on Labour to increase it's
funding and stop job losses.</p>

<p>The student movement for Free
Education is looking outward, in particular making contacts
with students on Polytech campuses.  Heather  Lyall from
Waikato Fightback spoke at the Aotearoa Polytech Students
Union conference in Taupo at the beginnig of July, and
several Poly campuses are organising to join Universities in
the next wave of national protest.  A nucleus of strong and
outward looking activists on a campus will grow in the  next
period, as is borne out by the experience on Waikato and
Wellington.  We also need joint staff/student resistance to
job losses and course  closures, and invite staff members to
activist meetings.</p>

<p>Labour are offering job losses,
inadequate funding, a continuation of student debt and high
fees that bar many people from low income backgrounds the
right to educate themselves.  "Cut the crap- stuff your Cap-
Labour's student poverty trap!". This term will see a new
wave of students taking the power back, by the only  real
way to get change.  And that's grassroots action- strikes,
occupations,  marches and solidarity.  Let's stand up for
our rights.</p>
