         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Lawyers acting for the
Association of University Staff (AUS) have sent a letter to
all members of the Massey University Council advising them
that if they proceed to make decisions related to the future
of academic programmes without seeking the advice of the
Academic Committee of the Academic Board, they will be in
breach of both the Education Act 1989 and the university’s
own internal statutes.</p><p>“The failure of management to seek
advice from the Academic Committee for the ‘repositioning’
project has confirmed what many Massey staff have said –
that those running the university are concerned only about
profits, and have ignored the serious academic
consequences’, said Neville Blampied, National President of
the Association of University Staff. </p><p>“Though the
University’s regulations are clear, the Vice-Chancellor
failed to ensure that the repositioning proposals were
referred to the Academic Committee, and though aware that
this had not been done, the Academic Board at its meeting on
19 July endorsed the ‘repositioning’ proposals without
obtaining that Committee’s prior advice.”</p><p>Rob Crozier, AUS
Executive Director, stated that “AUS has consistently argued
that Massey should postpone any restructuring until the
Tertiary Education Advisory Commission has reported on the
future shape of the tertiary education sector.  Management’s
refusal to even consider this has left AUS with no
alternative but to seek legal advice on the matter.” </p><p>“AUS
believes that the Council must now abandon the
‘repositioning’ proposals or refer them back to the Academic
Board with a direction that the Board refer the proposals to
the 5 College Boards and the Academic Committee for proper
consideration of their academic implications,” said Neville
Blampied.  “Any other action risks a serious breach of the
Education Act.”
