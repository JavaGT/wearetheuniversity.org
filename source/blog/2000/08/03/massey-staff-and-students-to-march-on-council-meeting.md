controversial Massey University 'repositioning' and cost
cutting project will culminate in a staff and student march
to Massey University Council meeting on Friday August 4th. 
The march leaves from Registry Building (main campus) for
Hokowhitu campus at 9.00am.</p>

<p>"The unions at Massey
University have called stop-work time for Friday morning
9.00-11.00am to convey to the University Council and the
wider community how important it is to abandon this divisive
restructuring.  Albany members are also calling a stop-work
meeting and will be linked via teleconference to the
University Council meeting at Hokowhitu which starts at
10.00am," said Association of University Staff (AUS) Branch
President, Associate Professor Lewis.</p>

<p>"Staff and students
will be marching to show solidarity to the 300 plus staff
who do not have secure jobs, to protect the quality and
diversity of teaching and research at Massey university, to
protest the lack of consultation which has damaged staff
morale and to insist on the principle of open governance at
our public institution," said Professor Lewis.</p>

<p>"It is not
too late for University Council to recover from the damage
that the 'DEpositioning' project has caused.  We urge
Council members to consider the legal situation, abandon the
proposals before them, and join with their staff and
students in a genuine 'repositioning' exercise which will
move Massey forward and take account of our strengths in the
arts and sciences, education and business," said Professor
Lewis.</p>
