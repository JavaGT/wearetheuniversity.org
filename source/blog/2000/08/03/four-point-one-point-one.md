         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) is deeply concerned at the reported
comments of Massey University Vice-Chancellor, Professor
James McWha, that having consulted the Academic Board, he is
not obliged to take advice from any other quarter.</p><p>AUS
Executive Director, Rob Crozier, said in Wellington today
that Professor McWha’s statement was consistent with the
attitude of a chief executive running a private education
company, but that it was astonishing that the
Vice-Chancellor of a public university would ignore both
legislation and Massey’s own internal rules, which set down
the decision-making processes of the
University.</p><p>“Professor McWha is the employee of the
University Council (in fact its only employee!) and, as
such, he is charged with managing the affairs of the
university within the policy framework set by Council,” said
Mr Crozier.  “These are set out in 4.2.1 of the Manual of
Operating Procedures and Policies, approved by the Council
on 1 January 1997.”</p><p>“It is the Council which is required
by the Education Act [see below] to consult the Academic
Board and other bodies specifically set up to advise on such
matters.  This, and the Council’s own operating policies,
require the Academic Board to secure the support of the
Academic Committee for any proposals that involve such
significant changes to the University’s academic
programmes.”

<p>“This latter step has not been complied with
