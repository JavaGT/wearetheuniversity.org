have flooded the campus with blue stickers and posters to
protest the University management's refusal to offer a
contract settlement that even came close to being accepted
by University staff.</p>

<p>On Monday 21August, union members
came to work dressed in blue.  "The action committee chose
blue because it is the universityâ€™s colour and blue
represents how Massey management makes our members feel,"
said Combined Union Action Committee speaker, Dr Karen
Rhodes.</p>

<p>"Actually our members feel black and blue these
days after months of high-handed treatment from the
Vice-Chancellor and his management team.  So, tomorrow
(Friday 25 August) we are staging a 'pump up morale' rally
on the University concourse, with balloons, banners, bangers
and a blues band, of course," said Dr Rhodes.</p>

<p>"Staff feel
tossed about by management's claims that their contract
offers constitute a good package.  The offers they have
touted in the press in reality hold little for the vast
majority of Massey staff.  Furthermore, these small offers
hide significant clawbacks in other areas.  Staff think the
offer represents nothing more than rearranging the deck
chairs on a sinking ship.  We need a new captain, one who
believes in the expertise and goodwill of his own crew,"
said Dr Rhodes.</p>
