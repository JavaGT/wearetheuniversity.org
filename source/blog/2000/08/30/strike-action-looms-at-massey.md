<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Organisation for the
24-hour strike at Massey University on September 1st is well
underway. Union pickets on each campus will express staff
members' opposition to University management's dismal
contract offer.</p>

<p>Union organisers have not only contacted
members concerning strike action but are also contacting
other staff members and students informing them about the
issues in dispute and the plans for Friday's strike.</p>

<p>"We
have been in regular contact with the students' associations
who support the action we are taking and we thank them for
this.  We also acknowledge that a small number of members
work in crucial activities in the Veterinary Clinic; the
animals they care for must be fed and treated.  These
veterinary staff will be supporting the strike but
continuing to work while wearing 'we support the strike'
stickers," said Combined Union Industrial Campaign speaker,
Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>

<p>"We expect all of our members to strike,
of course, and we anticipate most will be on the picket
lines.  This is history in the making as it is the first
ever strike at Massey.  When other strikes have loomed in
the recent past management has enhanced its offer for a
settlement and the unions have ratified.  We have never come
this close to strike day without such an offer.  We have
indicated to the employer that we are willing to talk but
our members will need to see significant movement from them
before they will consider ratification," said Dr
Rhodes.</p>
