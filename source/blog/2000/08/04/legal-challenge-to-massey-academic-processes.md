University Staff (AUS) is issuing proceedings to challenge
the internal academic decision-making processes followed by
Massey University in its ‘repositioning’ exercise.</p>

<p>AUS
Executive Director, Rob Crozier, said in Wellington today
that the Association believed that the mandated procedures
at Massey University have not been followed.</p>

<p>“To enable
this dispute to be resolved, Massey University Council has
agreed to withhold from consideration some of the
recommendations before it today and will not proceed to
implement others pending the outcome of the Court hearing,”
said Mr Crozier.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that the High Court
hearing will take place early in September.</p>
