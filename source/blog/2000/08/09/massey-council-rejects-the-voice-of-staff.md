released University Council decisions relating to the
controversial 'repositioning' and cost-cutting project to
representatives from the Association of University Staff
(AUS) today.  The University has agreed not to implement any
decisions with staffing implications until an AUS legal
challenge is heard in the High Court, probably in
mid-September.</p><p>"The only changes Council made to the draft
proposals, which recommended the axing of 86 equivalent
full-time positions, are in the Humanities and Social
Sciences College on the Albany campus,” said Associate
Professor Tony Lewis, AUS Branch
President.</p><p>“Recommendations relating to the College
structure and reduction of staff at Albany have been
referred back to the Vice-Chancellor for reconsideration. 
This was a change that AUS endorsed and we are pleased with
this result.”</p><p>“That Council saw the need to change the
Albany portion of this particular proposal, however, shows
up its generally flawed nature.  AUS cannot understand how
Council endorsed the rest of the terrible Humanities and
Social Sciences proposal.  When put to the Vice-Chancellor
by AUS representatives today, he did not see fit to question
Council's inconsistent decisions."</p><p>"Staff were disgusted
that discussions and decisions regarding the 'repositioning'
proposals were held in secret last Friday.  A number of
staff felt strongly enough that they refused to leave the
meeting when it went into closed session," said Professor
Lewis.

<p>"It has made us conscious that staff must become
proactive in the process of appointments to these crucial
decision-making bodies such as Academic Board and,
particularly, University Council.  Many Council members who
supported these flawed proposals were actually appointed by
the previous government and made decisions based on
principles out of step with current government policies, not
to mention their own staff and students’ assessment of these
proposals.</p><p>"Our immediate focus is now to prepare for the
case before the High Court and to turn to the industrial
campaign currently in progress over stalled contract
negotiations. </p><p><br>For more comment please contact Tony
