<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) claims that any urgency for pushing
through the controversial 'repositioning' and cost-cutting
project has vanished with the release of the current student
enrolment figures at Massey University.</p>

<p>"Latest figures
from the student management database show that the
Palmerston North student roll has not dropped since last
year despite the Vice-Chancellor's statements to the
contrary at the beginning of this process.  Last year 13,298
equivalent full-time students (EFTS) were taught from the
Palmerston North campuses; this year 13,201 are enrolled,
with another 150 applications yet to be processed," said AUS
Massey Branch President, Associate Professor Tony Lewis. 
“Similarly, enrolments are up from 2,690 to 2,826 EFTS at
Albany.”</p>

<p>"The AUS has always said that the University’s
senior management should not take precipitate action on the
'repositioning' project, but should wait until Government
initiatives become clearer and patterns of enrolment are
analysed more carefully.  Members of the Massey University
Council should be relieved to know they have time to give
careful consideration to plans for 'repositioning' without
the pressure that has been placed on them," said Professor
Lewis.  [Note for journalists: The University Council is
scheduled to make a decision on the 'repositioning' and
cost-cutting project on August 4th].<p>
<p>"It is not too late
to recover from the damage that the 'repositioning' and
cost-cutting exercise has caused.  AUS has submitted to
University Council an alternative and we believe genuine
'repositioning' process, with proper consultation, that
calls upon the expertise and commitment of staff, to move
Massey forward and to take account of our strengths in arts
and sciences, education and business," said Professor
Lewis.</p>

<p>"If redundancy payments are made to significant
numbers of staff, there will be no savings until the year
2001 anyway.  By that time we can have a plan in place to
make Massey University an attractive and favoured place to
study and work," said Professor Lewis.</p>
