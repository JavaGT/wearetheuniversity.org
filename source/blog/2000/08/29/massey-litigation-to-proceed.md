Association of University Staff (AUS) resolved today to
proceed with litigation against Massey University.</p>

<p>The
Association has challenged Massey’s current ‘repositioning’
project on the basis that, contrary to the Education Act,
the University Council had not ensured that all academic
bodies within the university had been properly consulted,
nor the academic consequences of the decisions properly
debated and considered, before it agreed to the
‘repositioning’ proposals.</p>

<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob
Crozier, said in Wellington today that Massey University’s
lawyers had argued successfully that if AUS wished to halt
the process temporarily pending the outcome of the hearing,
both AUS and the two members in whose name the case was
being taken, would be required to give an undertaking for
damages.</p>

<p>“The outcome was that if AUS held the process up
in this way and lost the court action, we would be facing a
damages bill of up to $600,000.  We therefore decided to
proceed with the action but not to give an undertaking for
damages.</p>

<p>“AUS was successful, however, in resisting
the University’s attempt to make two members of the
Association, in whose name the case is being taken, pay
damages if the case was lost,” said Mr Crozier.</p>

<p>“The judge
determined that to have agreed with the University on this
would have been oppressive.</p>

<p>“The judge also
confirmed that the case involves issues of principle with an
overlay of public interest.</p>

<p>“We anticipate that the matter
will be heard in the Wellington High Court on 6/7
September,” said Mr Crozier.</p>
