University Staff (AUS) has reacted angrily to the news that
Massey University’s Academic Committee has attempted to
validate retrospectively recommendations which it never
debated because it refused to consider them at the
appropriate time.</p><p>The Association, which is currently
making a legal challenge to Massey’s academic
decision-making processes in relation to its ‘repositioning’
exercise has been advised that the Academic Committee
yesterday passed the following resolution:</p><p>If it is
determined subsequently that it was the Academic Committee’s
role to advise the Academic Board in relation to the
repositioning, the Academic Committee supports the advice
given to Council by the Academic Board on the repositioning
on 21 July, 2000.</p><p>AUS President, Neville Blampied, said in
Wellington today that this was a cynical move that indicated
apparent contempt for Massey’s own procedures.</p><p>“This is a
sham decision in what has been a very shambolic process,” he
said.</p><p>The lack of involvement of the Academic Committee
earlier in the ‘repositioning’ process is a key factor in
the AUS legal challenge that is currently being
prepared.</p><p>“AUS affirms its belief that universities, when
making academic decisions, must scrupulously follow the
provisions of the Education Act 1989 and all of the
procedures and statutes that the University Council has put
in place.  The proper role of academic committees and boards
in a university is to consider carefully and debate fully
the academic merits of proposals and make appropriate
recommendations rather than act as a rubber stamp for
management decisions,” said Mr Blampied.</p><p>Contact for
