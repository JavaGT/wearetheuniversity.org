         <img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>In meetings throughout
the past week on various campuses, union members at the
troubled Massey University voted to reject the University's
offer of settlement of the collective employment contract
covering both general and academic staff.  The unions also
voted to conduct an industrial campaign commencing
immediately with the complete withdrawal of goodwill and a
24-hour strike scheduled for 1 September when the University
Council next meets.</p><p>This action comes at the end of five
months of dispute with the University’s senior managers over
their stewardship of Massey University.  This includes the
controversial downsizing and cost-cutting measures, which
the University management calls its  ‘repositioning'
project. </p><p>"Although management's pay offer does not cover
inflation, by management's own admission, money is not the
main concern for union members.  We are more troubled by
deteriorating working conditions which would result from
accepting this contract.  The issues that we have seen as
most important over the past several years, such as
workloads, academic promotions procedures and the
implementation of genuine consultation between management
and staff, have consistently been marginalised by
management," said the joint unions' action committee
spokesperson, Dr Karen Rhodes. </p><p>"One of my colleagues put
it this way.  ‘I am prepared to strike for a change in the
way decisions are made at this university, for a return to
democratic processes, for a change in management, all
leading to a return to working conditions in which one has
some pride and motivation.'

<p>This is a common feeling for
all staff across Massey's campuses," said Dr
Rhodes.</p><p>"Although management has conceded some issues in
an attempt to gain an ‘interim contract', they have
signalled more clawbacks of current conditions for next
year.  We find this whittling away of conditions totally
unacceptable," said Dr Rhodes.</p><p>For more information please
