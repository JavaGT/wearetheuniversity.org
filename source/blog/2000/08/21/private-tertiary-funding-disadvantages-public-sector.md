<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has reacted with dismay to the
tertiary education funding figures released by Associate
Minister (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey, during the
weekend.</p>

<p>“The figures show that funding for students in
private training establishments (PTEs) increased from around
$7 million in 1998 to $17 million in 1999 and has jumped
dramatically to $71 million this year,” said AUS President,
Neville Blampied.</p>

<p>“While the number of funded student
places in PTEs has increased by 31.2%, government subsidies
for these students have increased by a massive 322.8%.  This
has happened despite Labour promising last year to revert to
the earlier funding regime for PTEs.</p>

<p>“This year’s increase
alone represents a permanent reduction to public tertiary
education funding of around $50 million per annum.  It comes
on top of approximately $60 million removed from the sector
by Prime Minister Jenny Shipley in 1998 to cope with the
‘Asian crisis’.</p>

<p>These cuts came on top of the 4% per annum
reduction in real funding per student over the past 5 years
revealed in the recent Scott Report on University
Funding.</p>

<p>“To have cut $110 million from public tertiary
education in 3 years, at a time when every developed country
is investing in the information economy is utterly
extraordinary.  The Minister needs to explain to the country
how he expects the public tertiary education sector to cope
with such large cuts while at the same time ensuring that
New Zealand becomes a ‘knowledge society’,” said Neville
Blampied.<p>
<p>“As AUS members at Massey and Victoria know only
too well, public tertiary education in New Zealand is on the
brink of a catastrophe of mass redundancies, abolition of
courses, and loss of key research programmes and capacities,
all caused by the cumulative effects of persistent
under-funding,” said Mr Blampied.</p>

<p>“The Government must act
decisively and effectively and begin to restore these savage
cuts.  The supplementary estimates in October 2000 will
provide the first opportunity for this to occur,” said Mr
Blampied.</p>

<p>“It is ridiculous that Government funding for an
undergraduate science or computing degree is $370 more than
the subsidy paid to a student training to be a
hairdresser.”</p>
