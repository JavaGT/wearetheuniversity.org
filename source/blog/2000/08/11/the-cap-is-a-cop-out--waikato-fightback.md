<p>BAND AID ON A FLESH WOUND-</p>

<p><br>The Cap is a Cop Out- 
Waikato Fightback</p>

<p>"The Cap is not enough! it's fees we
have to stuff!"...</p>

<p>Around forty supporters of Fightback
Waikato stormed the University Council meeting in B Block
last Wednesday, to show their opposition to high  tuition
fees and inadequate government funding of tertiary
education.   Government is currently offering a 2.3%
increase in funding to Waikato if they freeze fees for 2001,
which Council voted to reluctantly accept.  Shane  Volger
from staff union SFWU raised fears that the funding would
not be  enough to stop staff cutbacks, course closures or
fee increases further down  the line, echoing Fightback's
concerns that Labour are putting a band aid on  a flesh
wound.   The protest forced Council to lobby other
Universities to campaign in unison for increased funding for
next year, instead of being individually isolated and forced
to accept government offers.</p>

<p>114 staff are being fired at
Massey Uni in Palmerston North, because of  inadequate
funding.  Victoria in Wellington faces $8 million in course 
closures, staff lay offs and cutbacks.  Some institutions
are threatening to double fees in 2002 to make up for this
year's losses- the fee freeze was a once off offer, with no
plans for next year.</p>

<p>We need a huge increase in funding
NOW to stop the market driven crisis in education. 
Fightback wants to see tuition fees abolished, and tertiary 
education established as a right for all, as it is in
Ireland, Germany and many other countries. Sadly, the new
Labour government are offering little- join the alternative
and fight for universal student living allowances, an end to
student debt and expensive fees.  Fightback!</p>
