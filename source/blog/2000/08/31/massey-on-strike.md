immediate release<br>31 August 2000</p><p></p><p>Massey on
Strike</p><p>Both general and academic staff at Massey
University are striking on Friday 1 September.  Last minute
informal talks between management and representatives of the
combined unions this morning clarified issues between the
two groups but drew them no closer to an agreement.</p><p>"Our
staff are deeply angered by management's attempts to
clawback certain conditions in the recently expired
collective contract, such as our retirement clauses and our
ability to include department heads in our collective," said
joint union industrial campaign speaker Dr Karen
Rhodes.</p><p>It does not help us reach agreement when our
members hear the management touting claims about the great
deal they have offered us.  Much of their 'offer' means
relatively little to our members, while our real concerns –
like the clawbacks – are ignored or denied," said Dr
Rhodes.</p><p>"We are very concerned about our rising workloads,
for instance, and with the threat of redundancies looming,
those of us left will face even heavier burdens. A working
party composed of management and union representatives to
establish workload guidelines was a provision of the
contract we ratified two years ago. Those guidelines were
finalised only yesterday.  We still have no guarantee that
they will be acceptable to the Vice-Chancellor, however.  He
has failed for a year to act on a similar document from a
similar working party on academic promotions," said Dr
Rhodes.

<p>Friday's strike action affects Massey's three main
campuses in Palmerston North, Albany and Wellington.  Staff
will be picketing campus entrances at various times
throughout the morning.  "We expect orderly and responsible
pamphletting of all people wishing to enter campus, with
organisers and safety officers at all locales," said Dr
Rhodes.</p><p></p><p>Contact:  	Dr Karen Rhodes h(06) 356-1100,
