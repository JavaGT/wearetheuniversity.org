	 <p>
         Auckland University Students to vote again on Voluntary or
Compulsory  Student Membership.</p><p>The Auckland University
Students Association (AUSA) has collected the  necessary
number of signatures to request the Univesity Council to
hold  another referendum on the future status of AUSA.
</p><p>Last year in May, as a  result of governemnt legislation,
students' associations around the country  were forced to
have a vote on whether the students in each institution 
which to have their students association remain compulsory
or become  voluntary. </p><p>The postal ballot referendum at
Auckland will be open from October 1st thru  November 1st.
As a result of the change to the Education Act, student
associations are no  longer required to fund supporters of
both sides equally when money from association levies are
used. </p><p>This is, however, something that AUSA is  committed
to doing. "The AUSA executive believes that students will
benefit most from an  equally funded campaign, we feel that
it is the executive's job to inform the students and not to
push a one sided arguement as happen last year." said AUSA
President Kane Stanford </p><p>"Obvioulsy AUSA executive
members, including myself, have a preference for one side or
the other but I feel uncomfortable using my position to 
influence the outcome of a vote of this magnitute." </p><p>"
AUSA executive has decided to fund both sides equally this
year and I  think that students will be better informed as a
result. The executive also  has measures in place to curtail
the misleading material that was published  last year"
</p><p>"All going well, we will have a good campaign and
students will send a  clear message to the executive about
they want their students association to be funded"</p><p></p><p>Kane
