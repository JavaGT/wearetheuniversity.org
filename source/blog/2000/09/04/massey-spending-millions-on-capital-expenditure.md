ASTE went on strike last Friday for the first time in Massey
University's history. Talks with management had broken down
some five weeks earlier when management refused to budge
from demanding clawbacks in retirement benefits and a pay
offer lower than the rate of inflation.</p>

<p>"The
Vice-Chancellor claims the University is between a rock and
a hard place due to long-term government underfunding to the
tertiary sector. But if that is so, why is he spending $60
million on capital expenditure this year alone? Our pay rise
request would cost less than one-twentieth of that amount.
If he's between a rock and a hard place, then the rock is
that crumbling old stone museum he's renovating in
Wellington, and the hard place is staff feelings over such
irresponsible spending in hard times," said joint unions’
industrial action committee speaker, Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>

<p>“The
Vice-Chancellor and Registrar also tried to divert attention
away from the current dispute by releasing academic
promotion details on Friday, claiming deserving staff
received 2-14% pay increases.</p>

<p>"A 14% pay increase in a
promotion round is unheard of.  It is possible, for
instance, that someone being promoted from Lecturer to
Senior Lecturer could make only a 1% pay increase," said Dr
Rhodes.</p>

<p>"It is ironic that management wants to tout
academic promotions at this time. One reason behind the
strike was the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to implement fairer
and more open guidelines for academic promotion procedures.<p>
<p>"To vaunt academic promotions also ignores the great
numbers of general staff. Only 1/6 of general staff received
any merit increase last year and those were nowhere near
14%. In the real world, the only people getting close to 14%
are the Vice-Chancellor and his upper management team,” said
Dr Rhodes.</p>

<p>"The VC thinks our concerns are 'silly' - his
word, not mine - and he does not intend to change his offer,
despite the strike. But at least one good thing has come of
it. Two of our members decided, while on the picket line, to
get married after seven years of being together. They
claimed they'd never forget their anniversary if they got
married on strike day!" said Dr Rhodes.</p>
