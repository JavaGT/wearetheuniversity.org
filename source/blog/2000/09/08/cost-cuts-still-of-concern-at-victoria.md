University have reacted with cautious optimism to the
release by University management of the Deficit Reduction
Consultation Document. </p><p>"It is clear the University has
attempted to address some of the underlying internal
problems that led to this year's unsustainable deficit and
has not just equated the deficit figure to a number of jobs
that need to be shed, which is encouraging," said
Association of University Staff branch spokesperson, Guy
Reynolds.</p><p>"The proposed management structure is clearer
than the existing one and better reflects the way the
University operates. Nevertheless, there is still a serious
danger that line management will overwhelm the essential
collegial nature of the university. </p><p>"The success of the
structure will depend considerably on the abilities and
insight of senior managers and senior academics," said Mr
Reynolds. "It will be essential to strengthen the role of
the Academic Board in ensuring that the Vice-Chancellor and
Council have sound academic advice on policies and practices
at Victoria.</p><p>"There is also a real possibility that in the
next stage of the process – the requirement that the
academic units of the university reduce costs by $4M will
fatally undermine our ability to offer some programmes and
downgrade the quality of many others. </p><p>"What remains
largely unknown is how these cuts to costs will be
apportioned amongst academic schools. The University’s
intention seems to be that courses must be profitable, which
places an enormous burden on subject areas such as science
and modern languages. This aspect of the funding system and
its implementation at Victoria must be the subject of
further debate,” said Mr Reynolds.

<p>"In general the
document signals a significant shift in the nature of
tertiary education at VUW. Perhaps the word 'uncertainty' is
useful to summarise this shift. From here on, a notional
line of 'profitability' will always be in sight for
academics. Fall below that line and one's academic position
and discipline are significantly at risk of deletion from
the VUW community. Just what this means in terms of the type
and quality of knowledge that VUW will support remains to be
seen.</p><p>"While this document represents Victoria
University's attempts to address current financial
realities, it cannot address the rapidly approaching crisis
in the sector brought about by chronic underfunding of
universities in New Zealand," said Mr Reynolds. </p><p>"As in
the health sector, academic pay rates are becoming
hopelessly uncompetitive in the international market and our
best teachers and researchers will continue, and in
increasing numbers, to head overseas. Students are having to
pay more for less, as staff to student ratios decline ever
further and the technology gap between New Zealand and the
first world continues to widen," he said.</p><p>Guy
