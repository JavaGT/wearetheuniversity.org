<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Chief Justice, Dame Sian
Elias, has today released her declaratory judgment in the
case between Otago University and its principal campus
unions, the Association of University Staff (AUS) and the
Public Service Association.</p>

<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob
Crozier, said in Wellington today that the judgment was a
victory for common sense.</p>

<p>“Otago University management
sought to continue to be able to make people retire when
they reach age 65, even though the Human Rights Act had made
that approach unlawful,” said Mr Crozier.</p>

<p>“The case hinged
on the implications of the Human Rights Act for staff who
were employed prior to 1 April 1992 and whose contract of
employment continued to contain a retirement age
provision.</p>

<p>“The judge has declared that section 149(2) of
the Human Rights Act 1991 does not permit variation or
confirmation of a retirement age specified in an employment
contract unless the employment contract was in force on 1
April 1992 and remains in force.</p>

<p>“It is possible that a
small number of employees not covered by the unions’
collective employment contract could still face compulsory
retirement.</p>

<p>“The Human Rights Commission supported the
restrictive interpretation that the unions were arguing for
and which the Court adopted,” he said.</p>
