<p>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has supported the call by the
Minister of State Services, Trevor Mallard, for full details
of the ‘golden handshake’ provided to the departing Victoria
University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Michael Irving, to be
made public.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Neville Blampied,
said in Christchurch today that there had been a growing and
alarming tendency for the details of senior management
salary packages to be kept secret.</p>

<p>“Similarly, staff
participation in the preparation of university budgets has
been virtually eliminated in the commercially-sensitive and
competitive world embraced so whole-heartedly by
Vice-Chancellors and Councils.”</p>

<p>“Openness and academic
freedom go hand in hand.  Universities are publicly-funded
institutions with a history of openness and the Association
considers it imperative that there be an urgent reassessment
of the competitive nature of university education in New
Zealand.”</p>

<p>“Any payment made to a Vice-Chancellor at the
termination of his employment and prior to the completion of
his contract must be clarified and fully justified by the
Council.  This payment was made at a time when a freeze on
buying books for the Library is in place and staff have been
forced to take industrial action in support of a salary
increase,” said Mr
Blampied.<br><p>
