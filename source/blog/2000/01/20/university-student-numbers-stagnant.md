Education’s statements regarding growth in the numbers of
tertiary students, in its recent report: New Zealand’s
Tertiary Education Sector: Profiles and Trends 1998 are
misleading.  The figures hide the fact that growth in
university student numbers has ceased, according to Rob
Crozier, Executive Director of the Association of University
Staff.</p>

<p>“The reported growth in student numbers does not
apply to the universities, where major growth occurred in
the 1980s [before the introduction of high fees and the
student loan scheme]. Growth may be continuing for
polytechnics, colleges of education and wananga, but it has
slowed for universities and last year there was no growth in
student numbers at all.</p>

<p>“Given the current, urgent
concern with lifting the country’s skills, knowledge and
research base, a halt to growth in university student
numbers is an issue that should have been identified and
addressed in a significant report on profile and trends such
as this.</p>

<p>“The report, as a whole, reflects government
policy of the late 1980s and 1990s, which viewed the
tertiary education sector as one homogeneous entity, with
all institutions having similar objectives and being funded
on the same basis,” said Mr Crozier.</p>

<p>“The new
Government’s stated policy of recognising and encouraging
the different, specialised role of each part of the sector
is long overdue. It is the only way to go if New Zealand is
to produce the educational, social, economic and cultural
outcomes needed in the new century.’<p>
