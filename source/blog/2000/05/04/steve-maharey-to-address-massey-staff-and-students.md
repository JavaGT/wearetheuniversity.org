Education (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey will speak at
Massey University tomorrow lunchtime [5 May] at the
invitation of the Association of University Staff (AUS).  Mr
Maharey will address Massey staff and students about the
Labour/Alliance Government's plans for tertiary
education.</p>

<p>“We are excited to have an opportunity to hear
about these policy developments from Mr Maharey because
Massey staff and students are interested to know how Massey
fits into the wider tertiary vision.  We have allowed a
significant time for questions and closed the meeting to the
press in order to give Massey staff and students the ability
to speak freely with Mr Maharey,” said Massey AUS President
Associate Professor Tony Lewis.</p>

<p>“Our meeting last week
with the Minister of Education, Hon. Trevor Mallard,
revealed a number of points relating to the government's
desire to put resources into public institutions and to
strengthen accountability for the use of these resources. 
We welcomed these comments," said Professor Lewis.</p>

<p>"Mr
Mallard was very clear that he was not willing to interfere
with the institutional autonomy of any university.  We are
pleased to learn that the chair of the newly formed Tertiary
Education Advisory Commission, Norman Kingsbury, will be
travelling to all of the universities to appraise senior
management of Government policy.  We have asked that he also
meet with representatives of academic and general staff in
light of the current 'repositioning' (restructuring)
situation at Massey," said Professor Lewis.</p>

meeting, 12.45pm outside the Marsden Lecture Theatre, by the
Science Towers on the Massey University main
campus.<br><p>
