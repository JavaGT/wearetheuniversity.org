joined students and Vice-Chancellors in welcoming the
Government’s move to place a moratorium on the number of
universities in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Neville Blampied, National
President of the Association of University Staff (AUS), said
in Christchurch today that this decision would allow the
newly-appointed Tertiary Education Advisory Commission to
carry out its work on the structure of the sector without
having to be concerned about Unitec’s application for
university status.</p>

<p>“In our view, the qualitative
principles underpinning the granting of university status
are more important than the question of how many
universities there should be in New Zealand.</p>

<p>“This action
by the Government will allow time for a realistic assessment
of the national commitment of resources we need to make for
New Zealand to sustain a university system that compares
favourably with overseas counterparts,” said Neville
Blampied.<p>

<p>Neville Blampied expressed a note of caution,
however:  “We do not want this to set a precedent for ad hoc
statutory interventions in the university sector.”</p>
