the Association of University Staff, Neville Blampied, has
joined colleagues at Massey in condemning the untimely
action of the Vice-Chancellor in signalling 116 redundancies
among university staff.</p>

<p>“Government has clearly signalled
its intention to seek rationalisation of course offerings
throughout the sector and the Tertiary Education Advisory
Commission (TEAC) is expected to provide advice on how this
might best be achieved.</p>

<p>“We therefore urge the University
to be patient and to postpone any decisions on the
“repositioning and cost-saving exercise” until TEAC has
reported on strategic directions,” said Neville
Blampied.</p>

<p>“We also understand that while Massey continues
to be in a surplus situation, it intends making decisions
that will affect the lives of its staff before it knows what
its final enrolment numbers for 2000 will
be.”<br><p>
