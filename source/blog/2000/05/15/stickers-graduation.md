<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>Massey University Staff
have been encouraged to show their support for retaining
current staffing levels on the Massey University Palmerston
North campuses by wearing stickers during Graduation
ceremonies.</p>

<p>"The stickers announce a call for the valuing
of public education and the protection of the diversity of
teaching and research currently undertaken at Massey
University.  The Association of University Staff (AUS)
believes the current 'repositioning exercise' does not have
the support of staff, is short-sighted and will have a
negative impact on students, both past and present," said
AUS spokesperson John Waldon.</p>

<p>"Concerned staff will be
leafleting students, their families and friends with
information about the 'repositioning project' before the
ceremonies begin.  We think that this presence is in keeping
with our University's role of encouraging debate about
important issues.  We also hope the stickers will add a bit
of colour to the ceremonies" said John Waldon.</p>

<p>"The
presence of AUS members, colleagues and graduands and their
families who choose to support AUS's stance will not only
add colour to this wonderful occasion but it will also show
that there is support for staff during this difficult time,"
said John Waldon.</p>

<p>"AUS members at Massey University wish
to extend our sincerest congratulations to the high quality
and wonderfully diverse range of graduands Massey is
currently able to honour, and has the privilege to teach,"
said John Waldon.</p>
