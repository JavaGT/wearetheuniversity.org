         <img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>Staff at Massey
University have today received one of three letters telling
them they still have a job, or will have to reapply for a
reduced number of jobs, or will no longer have a job, if the
university's 'repositioning’ proposals are approved by the
University Council in August.  </p><p>"This is a horrible
process and it saddens us that loyal and in some cases very
long-serving staff have received these letters today," said
Association of University Staff (AUS) Massey Branch
President, Associate Professor Tony Lewis.</p><p>"We had
predicted that the Management would announce redundancies of
around 100-150 to satisfy their belief that Massey,
particularly in Palmerston North, needs to shed $11 million
from its expenditure.  This is despite the fact that the
University is currently not in deficit.</p><p>“Massey University
is dogmatically wedded to increasing its surplus at the
expense of staff and students.  The announcement of 116
redundancies at Massey University today confirms our
impression that resources have been mismanaged in the past,
that management is currently out of touch with educational
needs, and is jeopardising the future of the University, its
reputation and its students," said Professor Lewis. 
</p><p>“Staff morale took a tumble during last year's
restructuring, and now anxiety about the direction in which
Massey University is headed is at a crisis level," said
Professor Lewis.

<p>"AUS has consistently voiced concern
that this 'repositioning' exercise is inconsistent with
current Government policy as stated by the Associate
Minister of Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey.  It is an
exercise in asset stripping rather than capacity building,"
said Professor Lewis.</p><p>"We are meeting with staff over the
next week and have called for a meeting of all campus unions
on June 7th to formalise the Unions' response to the review.
It is not over by a long way!   In the meantime our
interests lie in ensuring all our members are well informed
and able to receive the support they need at this time,"
said Professor Lewis.  </p><p></p><p>For more information please
