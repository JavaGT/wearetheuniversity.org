<p>Talk of universal student allowances at the weekend's
National Party regional conference has been welcomed by the
national student union, the Aotearoa Post-compulsory Student
Union (APSU).<p>

<p>National Party deputy leader Wyatt Creech
said the National Party would begin a "searching review" of
policy and will look at universal allowances as part of that
review.</p>

<p>"APSU has argued for a long time it is grossly
unfair to punish people for studying by denying them access
to living support," said David Penney, National President of
APSU.</p>

<p>"Mr Creech's comments on the weekend regarding
universal allowances means National is moving closer to the
policy position held by the majority (Alliance, Greens, NZ
First, United) of political parties in Parliament."</p>

<p>"We
hope the National Party will continue to think about
supporting - rather than punishing - people who are
bettering themselves.  We also hope that the National Party
will look again at its policies on Student Loans."</p>

<p>"Given
that a 'radical conservative' party is looking seriously at
universal allowances, we believe it is only logical that the
centre-left Labour Party in Government should act,"
concluded David Penney.</p>
