         PRESS RELEASE- Fightback Waikato</p><p>National Day of Action
for Free Education</p><p>12.30pm, Wednesday May 31st assembling
in front of Dianne Yeates office going to Dept. of
Education, Martin Gallaghers Office, WINZ and Hamilton City
Council.</p><p> The Fightback Hui in Ham brought together over
sixty activists from all over  Aotearoa, to plan the next
phase in the fight for Free Education.  Activists  from
Auckland University, AUT, the University of Waikato,
Victoria  University, Waikato Polytech, Massey and
Canterbury met over the Easter  weekend, and reconfirmed the
10 goals of the national campaign first put forward in
Wellington.  These are-</p><p>1.  Free Education for all by
taxing the rich (top 5%) and corporates. 2.  Universal
Student Living Allowances. 3.  The scrapping of all student
debt. 4.  Immediate reinstatement of the emergency
unemployment benifit. 5.  An end to the Privatisation Agenda
on campus. 6.  Democratic control of tertiary institutions
by student and staff. 7.  Adequate government funding to
tertiary providers. 8.  Adequate research funding not
controlled by corporates. 9.  No cops on campus. 10. Removal
of all non financial barriers, including, but not limited   
to women, Maori, Pacific Islanders, international, queer and
disabled students.</p><p>The Hui resolved to take two days of
action in the upcoming months to bring  our demands to the
local Labour party and the national Labour led  government. 
After the recent debate with Fightback on the Waikato
campus, Education Minister Steve Maharey admitted that
Labour MPs had beifitted from  free education themselves and
had not entered the workplace with huge debts.    We want to
bring this to national attention and to make clear to the 
government that this generation of students will not wait
for an undefined "gradual change" within "the next three
terms of government" (Maharey's  words).   In effect, this
is an admission by Labour that students can expect  another
9 years of debt, loans and fees- another decade of the
problems we face today.

<p>The first National Day of Action
for Free Education will take place on the 31st of May.  In
addition to raising the 10 demands, we will be calling for 
the immediate sacking of Christine Rankin, the scrapping of
the WINZ loans scheme, and stressing the need for a
Universal Student Living Allowance and  the restoration of
emergency benifit for students during holidays.  "Sack
Rankin Day" will look for wider support from the trade
unions, community assocations, campus staff and local city
councils.  Rallies on campus will march to local Labour
Party offices, with Wellington to march on the 
Beehive.</p><p>The government and Labour Party will be given
time to respond- we will make  it clear that we are coming
back for concrete action and answers. Campuses on the North
Island will Hui on the 1st/2nd of July, campuses on the
South Island on the 8th/9th, to consider the response. A
second National Day of Action has been agreed for the 26th
of July.  It is envisaged that if there  is no change in
position by then, we will go into nationwide
occupation.</p><p>Over the next phase, Fightback will be
involved in an intensive education campaign on the local
campuses, holding teach ins, organising campaign  stalls
several times a week, signing up new members, and taking our
message  onto the Polytechs.  The nationwide petition for
the ten demands will gather  thousands more signatures in
support of free education, and we will hold weekend stalls
in town and city centres to enlist community support.  
Alliance and Green MPs and Councillors who support free
education will be asked to come on the National Days of
Action, and to join students in the next wave of
occupations.</p><p>We hope that the next wave of occupations,
O2, will involve 500 to 1000  students per campus. 
Polytechs will be joining us in the next wave.  We will also
be petitioning staff unions to call for sympathetic
industrial action in support of Free Education.</p><p>Many
people voted Labour to get National out.  They did not vote
Labour for  a continuation of National education policies. 
We will work with this huge  mandate for change and put
concrete demands on Labour, rights that many of their MPs
enjoyed during their student days.  The ACT party estimates
the cost of Free Education at 450 million dollars per year. 
This sum can easily  be raised by taxing the corporations
and the ultra rich a mere percentage point extra in
tax.</p><p>Be reasonable- Demand the Possible Joe
