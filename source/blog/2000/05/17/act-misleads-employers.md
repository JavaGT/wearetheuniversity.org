Employers</p><p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) today
accused ACT of misleading employers about proposed new
employment legislation. AUS University of Canterbury Branch
Organiser, Marty Braithwaite, today referred to an analysis
by University of Canterbury senior lecturer in law, John
Hughes, of a single ACT Party media release (Newsroom
17/4/00) which contained 12 significant errors of fact.
</p><p>"These are not simple errors of interpretation", said Mr.
Braithwaite, "they are significant misrepresentations that
will fuel the already high level of ill-informed employer
opposition to the Employment Relations Bill. </p><p>“Examples of
errors in the ACT press release include a statement that the
Bill provides new "industrial inspectors" with the ability
to issue "massive" spot fines.  The press release includes
an example of a 'naughty' employer being given a $1,000 spot
fine.  </p><p>"Not only is there no provision for new industrial
inspectors, but there is also no provision for spot fines,
massive or otherwise, nor anything remotely resembling
this", said Mr. Braithwaite. </p><p>“The ACT press release
asserts that wrongful dismissals will be able to be filed
six years after dismissal. This is actually the case under
the current legislation and the Employment Relations Bill
expressly abolishes actions for wrongful dismissal.

<p>The
release also says that the grounds for personal grievance
are "widened" to include race, marital status and religion -
"the test is now subjective. If you felt you were insulted -
then the law says you were".  The Employment Relations Bill
neither widens the grounds for personal grievance, nor does
it propose applying any such subjective test.</p><p>"The
dissemination by ACT of such error-ridden information is
beyond political gamesmanship," said Mr. Braithwaite. "The
irony is that such mis-information has the potential to
damage the business confidence of the very constituency ACT
purports to represent.</p><p><br>For further information,
