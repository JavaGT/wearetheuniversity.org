<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the formation of an
international reference group to assist the work of the
Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC).</p>

<p>AUS
National President, Neville Blampied, said in Christchurch
today that the Association had urged the government to
appoint such a group from the day that TEAC was announced.<p>

<p>"Universities are, by their very nature, inherently
international in focus. They have always been outward
looking and committed to meeting international standards of
excellence" he said.<p>

<p>"It is essential that any review of
our tertiary education system should be deeply and
extensively informed by the best advice possible in an
international context.<p>

<p>â€œThe membership of the Advisory
Group announced today clearly covers a wide spectrum of
countries and tertiary education systems, and will be
further strengthened when advisors from the USA and Canada
are added."</p>

<p>Neville Blampied added that while AUS welcomes
this development, it continues to be concerned that TEAC is
overworked and under-resourced for the vital tasks it faces.<p>

<p>"If initiatives such as the International Advisory Group
are to yield maximum benefit to the <br>Commission's work,
then Government needs to ensure that Commission members and
Secretariat have the time and resources required to fully
consider issues and to prepare reports which will give New
Zealand the tertiary education system it needs for the 21st
century."<p>
