<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Association of
University of Staff (AUS) has welcomed the initiative to
encourage greater Maori and Pacific Island student
participation in tertiary education that has been announced
by the Hon Steve Maharey.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Neville
Blampied, said in Christchurch today that research shows
that there has been a decline in participation by these
groups as tuition fees have severely impacted on the cost of
education during the past decade</p>

<p>“As a small society,
struggling to meet the challenge to become a knowledge
society, New Zealand cannot afford the loss of talent from
any group or sector.<p>

<p>“AUS has, therefore, long been an
advocate for properly funded and resourced foundation and
bridging programmes, weighted funding and equity monitoring
of institutions.”</p>

<p>“As the Minister says, this package
recognises the additional costs in providing high quality
education to disadvantaged groups.”<p>

<p>“The package
therefore represents a good first step in the direction of
ensuring that access to tertiary education is facilitated
for all prospective students based on their potential to
achieve <br>rather than their ability to pay.”</p>

<p>Neville
Blampied added that a further major challenge for the
government and institutions was to <br>ensure that when
students participate in tertiary education, they can do so
in a properly resourced <br>system that can achieve quality
outcomes in a co-operative and collaborative way.<p>

<p>"That
is far from guaranteed under present policy settings and
funding arrangements," Blampied stated.</p>
