University of Staff (AUS) has welcomed the initiative to
encourage greater Maori and Pacific Island student
participation in tertiary education that has been announced
by the Hon Steve Maharey.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Neville
Blampied, said in Christchurch today that research shows
that there has been a decline in participation by these
groups as tuition fees have severely impacted on the cost of
education during the past decade</p>

<p>“As a small society,
struggling to meet the challenge to become a knowledge
society, New Zealand cannot afford the loss of talent from
any group or sector.<p>

<p>“AUS has, therefore, long been an
advocate for properly funded and resourced foundation and
bridging programmes, weighted funding and equity monitoring
of institutions.”</p>

<p>“As the Minister says, this package
recognises the additional costs in providing high quality
education to disadvantaged groups.”<p>

<p>“The package
therefore represents a good first step in the direction of
ensuring that access to tertiary education is facilitated
for all prospective students based on their potential to
achieve <br>rather than their ability to pay.”</p>

<p>Neville
Blampied added that a further major challenge for the
government and institutions was to <br>ensure that when
students participate in tertiary education, they can do so
in a properly resourced <br>system that can achieve quality
outcomes in a co-operative and collaborative way.<p>

<p>"That
is far from guaranteed under present policy settings and
funding arrangements," Blampied stated.</p>
