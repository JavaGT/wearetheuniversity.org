the Association of University Staff, which met in Wellington
on 4/5 December unanimously passed a resolution calling on
the Government to accelerate its review of the tertiary
sector so as to reverse the loss of skilled staff and
academic programmes.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Neville
Blampied, said in Wellington today that another year of
declining real funding for universities would be a
catastrophe for higher education in New Zealand.</p>

<p>“Whole
research teams are being lured overseas for better salaries
and, more importantly, better research support,” he said,
“and universities are surviving only by savage cuts to
library funding, departmental operating funds and teaching
programmes.”</p>

<p>“The Government must also put its words into
action and move the universities into a co-operative rather
than competitive mode in order to avoid further loss of
intellectual opportunity for young New
Zealanders.”</p>

<p><br>Neville M. Blampied<br>National
President</p>
