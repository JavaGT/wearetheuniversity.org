expressed bitter disappointment today that the Labour
Government has joined its National predecessor in refusing
to ratify Section IX of the UNESCO Declaration on the Status
of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel.</p>

<p>Section IX relates
to terms and conditions of employment.</p>

<p>Speaking in
Christchurch today, AUS National President Neville Blampied
said, "It is both remarkable and regrettable that a New
Zealand Labour government should refuse to affirm the ideals
embodied in Section IX of the UNESCO Recommendation. When
the UNESCO Recommendation was ratified by the National
Government in 1997, it refused to ratify Section IX.</p>

<p>“New
Zealand was one of only 4 countries to take this step, but
it was a step entirely consistent with the anti-worker
stance of the previous government. We expected better of a
Labour government," said Mr Blampied.</p>

<p>Neville Blampied
noted that the reasons given by the Associate Minister of
Education (Tertiary Education), Steve Maharey, justifying
the government's decisions seem to be ultra cautious,
especially given the Minister's own statement that "the
UNESCO recommendation does not … replace domestic law."<p>

<p>"Given that the Declaration is, as the Minister states,
'merely a statement of desired provisions for higher
education personnel', AUS completely fails to understand why
the government is unable positively to support ideals such
as tenure for academic staff and rigorous standards for
dismissal of staff," Neville Blampied said.<p>
<p>"A year on
from the election, the government has few tangible
achievements to point to in the tertiary education sector to
back up its rhetoric about the importance of higher
education to nation building in New Zealand.<p>

<p>“Ratifying
the UNESCO Declaration in its entirety is one step the
government could have taken, at no cost, to affirm its
positive views about the sector. We therefore call on the
Minister to reconsider his decision,” said Mr
Blampied.</p>
