<p>Proposed Agenda for the Hui in Ham</p>

<p>1.
PRESPECTIVES SESSION-Where are we at in the campaign for
National  occupations for free education?</p>

<p>A national
analysis of the state of the struggle.  Overall evaluation
of the  first round of occupations and actions.</p>

<p>a. at
every campus except Canterbury, the movement is in a better
position than it was at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>b.
There are strong signs of a high level of passive support
for the  national objectives on all campuses (thousands of
names on petitions) however</p>

<p>c. active participation is
much lower...Police brutality...Craccum....Right  wing execs
but mostly</p>

<p>d.  Illusions in reformism, the "Honeymood
period" of the Labour government.</p>

<p>2. Analysis of the most
successful actions-      Waikato and Victoria What can be
learned from the experiences of building and organising on
these  campuses<p>
<p>3. Brief reports from other campuses
Increase understanding and national networking and allow the
development of  new activists as speakers...AUT, MIT,
Waikato Polytech etc.</p>

<p>4. Reconfirmation of the Wellington
Hui goals (The 10 point programme)</p>

<p>5.  Key tasks facing
the movement. Activism under a Social Democratic government-
Why     Labour will not  deliver?    The Power of Protest
internationally, and nationwide     occupation in
particular.     International student movement experiences
from overseas.</p>

<p>5. Strategy and Tactics. Setting dates for
the next phase of Rallies and Occupations.  Planning
etc.</p>
