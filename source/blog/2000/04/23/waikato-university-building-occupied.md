<p>Waikato University Building Occupied<p>

<p>Press Release: For
immediate use<p>

<p>Fightback! Waikato again controls part of
Waikato University.<p>

<p>Last night ninety students stormed
the building which houses Campus Services Limited (CSL). 
CSL is the university's profit-driven asset management
division.  More students will be arriving all day.<p>

<p>The
lightening strike has been carefully organised to take
advantage of slack security and university holidays.  The
purpose of this occupation is to prove to the university
that students have control of campus.  The occupation
coincides with Fightback!'s national hui.  It is being held
in the holidays so that students from all around the country
could participate.  It is a final warning shot to the
university, and a practice run for the next phase of rallies
and occupations.<p>

<p>Hamilton's mayor, Russ Rimmington,
will visit the students later today to express his support.<p>

<p>The students will control the building for 51 hours,
symbolising the number of years it will take an average
woman to pay back her student loan.<p>

<p>This raid has been
carefully organised, with support already flooding through
from around the country.  Many campuses are represented in
the occupation.<p>

<p>"The market-driven focus of tertiary
education providers is unacceptable," student protester
Miriam Bellard stated.<p>

<p>"It is time for students to
regain control of what is rightfully ours.  We will not sit
back and be dictated to anymore.  We will not watch idly
while universities prostitute themselves for money.  We are
asserting our control of this, and every campus," said Ms
Bellard.<p>
<p>Anybody is welcome to visit the students.<p>

<p>To
show that protesters can have fun too, a rave will be held
tonight (using University resources) with guest DJ's and
bands, with every $5 entry donation helping Fightback!<p>
