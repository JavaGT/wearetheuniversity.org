<p>PRESS RELEASE<br>FIGHTBACK

<p>HAMILTON- "CITY OF FREE EDUCATION"... MAYOR OF
HAMILTON AND ALLIANCE COUNCILLOR TO SHOW SUPPORT AND
SOLIDARITY WITH THE "HUI IN HAM" FOR FREE
EDUCATION</p>

<p>PHOTOSHOOT 1.30pm SATURDAY 22nd APRIL</p>

<p>The
Mayor of Hamilton, Russ Rimmington, will support the
Fightback Hui in Hamilton this weekend.  The "Hui in Ham" is
uniting student activists from all over New Zealand,
building on last months wave of occupations and rallies that
rocked campuses nationwide.  Over the course of the weekend,
delegates will be comparing experiences and tactics, and
will hammer out  the strategy for the next round of action
to win their demands for Free Education, the Abolition of
Student Fees and Debt, and the replacement of the
discredited WINZ loans scheme with a Universal Student
Living  Allowance.</p>

<p>"We debated Steve Maharey on the
Waikato campus a fortnight ago, and he promised us gradual
change within the next three terms of government. That's
another decade of loans, debt and student poverty, and we
are not prepared to condemn another generation to the
problems we face today" said Fightback spokesperson Joe
Carolan.</p>

<p>"The support that our Mayor Russ Rimmington and
Alliance Councillor Dave Mc Pherson are giving to the Hui in
Ham, shows that there is huge support for Fightback's
demands in the wider community.  We have said that we are
not just fighting for ourselves- Education should be a right
for everyone in  the community, regardless of class or
income, and not just a privilege for the wealthy few.  User
Pays discriminates against those who cannot afford high
debt, and present government reforms are pitiful."<p>
<p>"Our
movement has grown stronger and gained more support since
the wave of occupations and actions at the end of March. 
The Hui this weekend will  look at ways we can translate
this huge amount of passive support into action  and
results.  We have gathered thousands of names on our
petitions for Free Education, that support nationwide
simultaneous occupations to abolish loans, fees and debt. 
The government was warned by the last round, now we are
preparing for the major battle ahead."</p>

<p>"At the end of this
conference, we hope to have the activists and  organisers
necessary to occupy and close the financial centres of all
the campuses nationwide.  This is the only way students can
take strike action against a system that has ignored our
calls for change. We appeal to students, parents and the
wider community to support us when this happens.  In the
words of the Manic Preachers song...</p>

<p>"If you tolerate
this, then your children will be next".</p>
