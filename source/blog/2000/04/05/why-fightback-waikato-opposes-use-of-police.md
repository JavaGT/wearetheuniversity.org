<p>Why Fightback Waikato Opposes Use Of Police Against
Students On Campus</p>

<p>Here are some media articles on the
controversial policing methods used in Auckland.  Sue
Bradford from the Green Party raised our concerns in 
Parliament about these.  After all, this is New Zealand, not
Tianamen  square!</p>

<p>The "Nose Hold" grip

<p>Arrests
of protestors for "Obstructing footpath" 
http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=125496<br></p>

<p>Police
used against Student Occupation

<p>Contrasted
by the Peaceful approach to Protest in Hamilton 
http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=127795</p>

<p>Our
occupation was peaceful, without violence or damage to
property. People do not have police watching over them in
their workplace. We will hold the Vice Chancellor Brian
Gould to his promise that he will not  use police against
peaceful student protests in the future.</p>
