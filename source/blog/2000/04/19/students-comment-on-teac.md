<p>The national student unions are offering their support to
the recently announced members of the Tertiary Education
Advisory Commission (TEAC), and are looking forward to
working with them in the coming months.</p>

<p>"TEAC has an
unenviable task," said David Penney, National President of
the Aotearoa Post-compulsory Student Union (APSU). "The
problems facing tertiary education are widespread, and TEAC
will need to begin work immediately on addressing the
inequalities that are present in tertiary education today."<p>

<p>"The commission has a good depth of experience on it,"
said David Penney  "We anticipate that they will look soon
to establish dialogue with key players in the sector as they
begin to formulate their initial wide ranging issues paper."<p>

<p>"The previous National government ran down the tertiary
sector in the last decade, and encouraged a cut throat
competitive environment, said Sam Huggard, Co President of
the New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA).  
"As the recent 'repositioning' project at Massey University
shows, this sort of mentality lingers on.  TEAC has been
asked to give strategic advice on redeveloping a tertiary
sector than can work collaboratively, and we are welcoming
this - it is long overdue," said Sam Huggard.</p>

<p>"We are
thankful that New Zealand now has a government that is
willing to seek advice on what changes are needed in
tertiary education, rather than bumbling through blindly as
the government did.  Together with the Education and Science
Select Committee inquiry into student loans, we are looking
forward to offering student's perspectives and what the
pressing issues are in tertiary education," concluded Sam
Huggard.</p>
