<p><br>The National Student Unions today said their focus
during the Government's evaluation into WINZ's handling of
student loans would be on getting things right for students
in 2001.<p>

<p>Today the Minister of Social Services annouced
the details of an evaluation into WINZ's handling of student
loans processing and invited the national student bodies,
APSU and NZUSA to make submissions.<p>

<p>"It is common
knowledge that student loan processing has been a nightmare
for thousands of students this year and we are committed to
making sure that it is never allowed to happen again," said
David Penney National President of the Aotearoa
Post-compulsory Student Union.<p>

<p>"Our top prority is to
make sure that loans in 2001 will be delievered in a timely
and efficient manner," said Sam Huggard, Co-President of the
New Zealand University Students Association.</p>

<p>"We are
grateful to the Minister, Steve Maharey, for acknowledging
the problem straight-away and now following through with his
promise of an independent investigation into student loan
processing," said David Penney.</p>

<p>"APSU and NZUSA have,
through their constituent associations, been gathering a
wealth of material on WINZ's processing of student loans
this year, including a casebook of student grievances, and
we are confident that if our recommendations are followed
this debacle won't be repeated in 2001," concluded Sam
Huggard.</p>
