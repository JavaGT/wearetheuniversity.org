<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>A report on academic
freedom in New Zealand, commissioned by the Association of
University Staff (AUS), sees potential conflict between
principles of academic freedom and pressures to get
commercial funding for research.</p>

<p>Canadian Higher Education
expert, Dr Donald Savage, wrote the report following an
extensive visit to New Zealand in 1999.  The full report is
being published by Dunmore Press and will be available in
June.</p>

<p>Dr Savage notes that universities must have policies
which ensure that research contracts between universities
and businesses are open contracts, which do not set up
conflicts of interest and do not inhibit research in social,
environmental and health concerns.<p>

<p>"Universities should
reject contracts that have inappropriate strings attached,"
he stated.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Neville Blampied, has
welcomed these recommendations.<p>

<p>"University staff have
always recognised that there is a legitimate place for
commercially-sponsored research within universities and we
welcome the Government’s statement that increasing private
investment in research is a priority.<p>

<p>“Any restrictions
on free publication of results, however, must be very
carefully controlled and monitored, because they involve
restrictions on academic freedom and may be contrary to the
public interest," Neville Blampied said.<p>

<p>"Dr Savage’s
report draws attention to some very disturbing possible
threats to academic freedom.  These include the possibility
that private research sponsors may try to prevent
researchers from doing further research which may reveal
contradictory results, and prevent university researchers
from speaking out where their research reveals threats to
public health or wellbeing."</p>

<p>"The growth and vitality of a
knowledge society is closely linked to free and rapid
sharing of information. AUS will work vigorously to ensure
that that continues to be true within the New Zealand
university research community" he said.</p>
