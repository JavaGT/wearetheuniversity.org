<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The Association for
United Science (AUS) has welcomed rumours that the
Government is seriously contemplating the merger of the
various Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) into a new
Department of Science and Innovation (DSI).</p>

<p>Neville
Whitefoot, chair of AUS national council said in
Christchurch that the fragmented and competitive nature of
the CRI research and development sector in New Zealand was a
major barrier to New Zealand developing a knowledge economy.
"Only by merging these small entities will we obtain the
critical mass needed for the information economy in the 21st
century."</p>

<p>“The establishment of DSI will also provide an
opportunity for funds that are currently spent on managerial
salaries and wasteful competition to be channelled into
coal-face science,” said Neville Whitefoot.</p>

<p>“We understand
that the new DSI will be the operational arm of the
country’s research initiatives while the Ministry of
Research, Science and Technology will continue to be the
policy arm”, said Rob Crossbearer, General Secretary of AUS.<p>

<p>"AUS expects the new DSI to be widely welcomed by
farming, technology and research leaders, who have been
active in calling for government initiatives to merge
institutions in the research and development
area".</p>
