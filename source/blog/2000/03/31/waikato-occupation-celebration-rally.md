<p>Occupying students at the University of Waikato march to
Hamilton City  Centre today, celebrating their successful
two day control of the  University's B Block.<p>

<p>They are
to be joined by students from the Waikato Polytechnic and
the battling students of Auckland, in a demonstration for
Free Education through the streets of Hamilton.<p>

<p>Mayor
Russ Rimmington has supported their call for Free Education,
and the march will finish at the Council Buildings, where
the Waikato Occupiers have  been awarded the freedom of the
city to speak out against student debt and poverty.</p>

<p>"Every
hour we were in occupation, represents a year of debt
repayments for  the average student before they pay off
their student loan.  Our message to  the Labour party is
simple- the Honeymoon is over.<p>

<p>"The majority of Labour
MPs sitting in the Beehive benifited from Free Education,
yet they have the  arrogance to tell this present generation
it is unrealistic.  This weeks co  ordinated nationwide
action and occupation by Fightback is a warning shot to  the
Labour Party.<p>

<p>"Abolish student debt, loans and fees, and
bring in a  decent Universal Student Living Allowance.  If
you don't, we'll be back with  twice the strength, and we
will close every campus in the nation.  You had free
education, now we demand our rights.  You have been warned."
said  Fightback spokesperson Joe Carolan.<p>
