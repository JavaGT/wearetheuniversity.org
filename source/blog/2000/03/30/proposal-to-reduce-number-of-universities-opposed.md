<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) shares the concerns expressed
yesterday by farming, technology and research leaders that,
without urgent action, New Zealand was at risk of a
continuing loss of its human capital and of falling further
and further behind advanced economies. The AUS disagrees,
however, that the solution to these problems lies in
reducing the number of universities.</p>

<p>Speaking in
Christchurch today, AUS National President, Neville
Blampied, said that the idea that New Zealand could build a
"world-class" university system by merging institutions is a
managerialist dream, which could just as easily turn into a
nightmare.<p>

<p>"New Zealand universities have always been
internationally focussed, and committed to achieving
international standards in research, scholarship and
teaching. Every university has developed areas of particular
strength. Developing existing centres of excellence by
enhanced funding and some consolidation of effort would
deliver better outcomes for New Zealand than any forced
amalgamation process," he said.</p>

<p>Neville Blampied added
that initiatives such as the soon-to-be-announced Tertiary
Education Advisory Commission mean that Government policy is
moving in a positive direction, and AUS believes that there
is much that can be done to enhance the performance of our
university system, short of the disruption and distraction
of mergers.<p>
<p>"This includes reducing barriers to
co-operation within the sector; reducing staff stress and
low morale by attending to uncompetitive pay and adverse
conditions; and by repairing damage to the physical and
intellectual infrastructure caused by a decade of funding
cuts."</p>

<p>AUS welcomes evidence that there is a growing
consensus among sector leaders in New Zealand about the
critical importance of developing the knowledge society.
"Our members have a vital role to play in this development,"
Blampied said, "and they welcome the challenge of working
with the government and other leaders to achieve this
objective."</p>
