<p>Labour's honeymoon is over. Today Fightback! Waikato's
occupation of the registry continues, with the group calling
on Labour to put right a  sickening history of tertiary
education management.</p>

<p>It was Labour who abolished free
education in 1988 by increasing  administration fees by 80%.
It was Labour who gave the rich their biggest tax cut in
this nation's history whilst shamelessly declaring free
education  impossible.</p>

<p>Labour's Phil Goff branded
university students 'middle class' yet excluded the working
class from accessing university by bringing in fees in
1990.</p>

<p>The door Labour wedged open was flung aside by
National when they hiked fees  up even further despite
feeble Lockwood Smith's infamous promise to abolish  fees or
resign.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence enrolments have dropped every
year since 1992. No  coincidence that Maori enrolments
continue to plunge, despite Maori quotas.</p>

<p>Student loans
have added an extra hurdle to working class youth on their
road to university education.</p>

<p>This situation is
intolerable, more than 324,000 students have racked up over
$3.4 billion in dept through loans.</p>

<p>The huge fees mean
many don't ever get into university to start with.</p>

<p>We are
sick of being patronised and repressed. After twelve years
of  silence, Waikato university and polytechnic students are
occupying.</p>

<p>Our campaign of joint, rolling occupations of
campus' nationwide is intended  to press Labour to make real
moves towards free education by making it more  unaffordable
for them to refuse.<p>
<p>For years Labour has turned their back
on our plight. We call for them to look us in the face,
engage in dialogue and right a sickening history of
wrongs.</p>

in other parts of the university throughout the day, contact
