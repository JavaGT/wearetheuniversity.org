University Staff (formerly the Association of University
Teachers) is launching its published history in Parliament’s
Grand Hall this evening.</p>

<p>The publication, Professionals
and Unionists, covers the 75–year history of the Association
for the period 1923 –1998 and was written by Emeritus
Professor Nicholas Tarling of Auckland University, a former
National President of the Association.</p>

<p>AUS Executive
Director, Rob Crozier, said that Parliament has been chosen
for the launch because more than 10% of MPs (including the
Prime Minister) are ex members of the Association.  Former
member, the Hon Steve Maharey, now Associate Minister for
Tertiary Education, will formally launch the
publication.</p>

<p>Rob Crozier said that New Zealand’s union
history was an important facet of the nation’s past and he
was pleased that the Association had committed itself to
commissioning this work.</p>

<p>“The launch comes during a week
in which organisations such as ourselves will again have to
regroup for the next phase of our existence.”</p>

<p>Note: 
Professionals and Unionists (132 pp) can be obtained from
the Association of University Staff, P.O. Box 11-767,
Wellington; price $15 (incl. Gst, p&amp;p)</p>
