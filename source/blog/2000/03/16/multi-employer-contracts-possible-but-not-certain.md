<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has reacted with concern to reports
that it plans to seek multi-employer contracts in the
universities.</p>

<p>AUS has welcomed the introduction of the
Employment Relations Bill as, combined with the Government’s
declared intention to make the tertiary education sector
operate in a more co-operative way, it provides scope for
the real value of staff to the institutions to be
recognised.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Neville Blampied,
confirmed from Christchurch yesterday that AUS had resolved
to develop and implement a national political/industrial
strategy on university academic pay and conditions based on
national and international relativities.<p>

<p>“This does not
automatically translate into negotiations for a
multi-employer contract.  The proposed select committee
inquiry into the resourcing of tertiary education, for
example, could have a profound impact on salary levels in
the sector.”</p>

<p>“As we understand it, before any
multi-employer agreement could be negotiated this would
first have to be approved by a majority of employees on each
site.”<p>

<p>“AUS is extremely democratic in the way it takes
such decisions. Members ultimately determine AUS policy and,
as 50% of AUS members are general staff, their views will
also be taken into account,” he said.</p>
