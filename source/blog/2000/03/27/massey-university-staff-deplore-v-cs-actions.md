deplore Vice-Chancellor's actions</p>

<p>Association of
University Staff (AUS) representatives at Massey University
have finished a round of consultation with members across
all Massey campuses.  The meetings, all of which were
well-attended, determined that the Vice-Chancellor's
'repositioning' process at the University invites staff to
engage in a divisive restructuring exercise.<p>

<p>"Members are
voicing their disgust that this 'repositioning' will erode
the academic integrity of Massey University's programmes,"
said AUS Branch President, Associate Professor Tony
Lewis.</p>

<p>"We deplore being asked to point the finger at
colleagues and label them as 'financially non-viable,' and
we do not wish to participate in such a process.</p>

<p>"It is
also becoming clearer that the demographic and enrolment
changes cited by the Vice-Chancellor have been known for
some time, yet we are suddenly confronted with
'repositioning' in a timeframe that leaves little room for
valid long-term planning.  While University managers, by
their own timeline document, have foreseen falling
enrolments for some time, staff were informed about
'repositioning' only last week," said Lewis.</p>

<p>"Staff are
asking if the University cannot pay its bills, as the
Vice-Chancellor implies, why are they spending so much money
on expansionism around the country?<p>
<p>"How can Massey staff
continue to provide quality academic programmes that fulfil
the needs of students and the university in accordance with
the new government’s vision for New Zealand’s tertiary
education system, when they receive veiled threats of staff
cuts and programme reductions?" asked Lewis.</p>
