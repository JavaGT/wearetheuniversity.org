<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has today welcomed the introduction
of the Employment Relations Bill, expressing the hope that
the new legislation might provide an environment in which
university salaries can become internationally
competitive.</p>

<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier recalled
today that it was Helen Clark as Minister of Labour who
removed university academic staff from the jurisdiction of
the Higher Salaries Commission in 1987, ironically so that
academic staff could bargain for better salaries.</p>

<p>“Since
that time, the benchmark senior lecturer salary has declined
from parity with a backbench Member of Parliament to about
85% of an MP’s salary today (less, if MPs’ allowances are
taken into account,” he said.</p>

<p>Neville Blampied, AUS
President, said in Christchurch today that it was vital that
the Government, as principal funder of universities,
recognised that it is the intellectual capital represented
by the staff which is of paramount importance to a knowledge
society.</p>

<p>“If Government wants New Zealand to be a
knowledge-based society, then it must fund the universities
to pay salaries that will attract the world’s best to New
Zealand.”</p>

<p>Neville Blampied said that the entire university
world was faced with a staff recruitment crisis in the next
decade as ‘baby boomers’ retired, and New Zealand would be
left behind if it could not compete for staff.</p>
