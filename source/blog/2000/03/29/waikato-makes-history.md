           <h1>Waikato Makes History</h1>

	 <p>
         Over 100 Waikato University students took control of the
campus registry today, calling for free education for
tertiary students nationwide.</p><p>This is the first occupation
of Waikato University in the past twelve
years.</p><p>"Congratulations Waikato, our apathy has ended and
the time has come for us  to make a stand against
debilitating debt.  We are standing up today to  avoid a
future of poverty," Fightback organiser Heather Lyall
said.</p><p>We now occupy all three floors of the registry
building, crippling the  university's finance and management
divisions.</p><p>Waikato University staff will not be allowed
into this student space for the  next 48 hours.</p><p>So far
there has been no police presence on campus and security has
been minimal.  Our protest is peaceful and we will not
damage any University  property.  We will leave peacefully
after making our demands and completing  our 48 hour
occupation.</p><p>We call on Vice Chancellor Bryan Gould to
honour his promise yesterday not to call in police or extra
security.</p><p>"Bryan's promise yesterday was excellent: we
commend him for stating  publicly that he supports free
education, and allowing us free rein of the building.  We
are cautiously optimistic he will honour his promise,"
Heather  said.</p><p>Amongst Fightback's demands to Government,
we call for universal allowances  for all students, wiping
of all student debt and free education for all.  Many  of
the same politicians who say this is unfeasible benefited
from free  education themselves.

<p>"We are calling on Labour
to listen to our call.  Students across New  Zealand have
united, it is perilous for them to ignore us."</p><p>We welcome
the support we have received from Alliance and many campus
staff  members.</p><p>The student loan system does not just
affect students, it affects their  families as well.</p><p>For
this reason our student space has been set up as a child-
and whanau- friendly zone, with all supporters and their
families welcome to visit with  donations of food and
blankets and stay the night.</p><p>Forums will be held
throughout the occupation to educate students on our
movement.</p><p>by David
