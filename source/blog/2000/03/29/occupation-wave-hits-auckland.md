<p>Occupation wave hits
Auckland!</p>

<p>*********************************************************************</p>

<p>RALLY
TODAY 12.30 (WEDNESDAY 29th) UNI OF AUCKLAND QUAD PRINCES
ST</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>

<p>29th
March 2000 Media Statement</p>

<p>Occupation wave hits
Auckland!</p>

<p>A wave of nationwide campus protests and
occupations continues today as  Auckland University students
protest against user-pays education.  "Students  are
protesting in disgust at the Labour-led Government's
unwillingness to seriously address the high fees, massive
debt burden and lack of support facing us," said Megan Hall,
spokesperson for Fightback! the group  organising the
protest.</p>

<p>"We are concerned that fees constitute a clear
barrier to education and that  tertiary study is no longer
an option for many people," said Hall.  "We are  acting in
solidarity with students around the country, especially
those  Victoria University students who have occupied their
University's main  administration building."</p>

<p>"We support
the focus of this wave of protests on University management.
These management big-wigs are failing to put pressure on the
Labour-Led  Government to adequately fund tertiary
education.  Instead they choose to pass funding cuts on to
students and make staff cuts so they can fund their  own
exorbitant salaries," said Hall.</p>

<p>Students will rally in
the University of Auckland Quad (Princes St) at  12:30pm. 
Speakers will include Alliance MP and Minister of Youth
Affairs Laila Harr√©.<p>
<p>"Students are doing what they have to
in the fight for what is their right -  free education.  We
have had to put up with these right wing policies for too
long.  This government has promised to do something about
the situation  of students in this country, but so far they
have failed to do anything for  the majority of people
affected by the Loans scheme and user-pays education.   
Labour and the Alliance have yet to make any move on
improving access to high quality tertiary education, despite
their election promises," said  Hall.</p>

<p>The demands of
Fightback, in conjunction with other student groups across
the country, are:</p>

<p>Free education for all Universal student
allowances Reinstatement of the Emergency Unemployment
Benefit Democratic control of universities including student
representation at  managerial level Dumping of student debt
An end to privatisation, managerialism and competition in
education Adequate government funding to tertiary providers
Adequate research funding not controlled by corporate
interests Removal of all non-financial barriers to education
No cops on campus No more staff cuts</p>
