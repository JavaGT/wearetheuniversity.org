<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>The report into the state
of academic freedom in New Zealand universities,
commissioned by the Association of University Staff (AUS)
last year, has been completed. A summary of the report,
together with its recommendations, has been released to the
media and can be read on the AUS website [www.aus.ac.nz]
from Monday 13 March. Dunmore Press will publish the full
report later in the year in book form.</p>

<p>Dr Donald Savage,
Canadian higher education specialist who conducted the
independent inquiry, consulted people from many sectors,
including the universities, the government and the
parliamentary opposition, the Ministry of Education, the
Business Roundtable, the Academic Audit Unit and the
Security Intelligence Service. The inquiry was publicised
throughout the universities, and staff were invited to raise
any related issues.<p>

<p>The report has three main
parts:</p>

<p>Definitions of academic freedom<br> Part A
examines and clarifies various definitions of academic
freedom<br> It notes that the institutional form of
academic freedom, university autonomy, requires a degree of
self-governance necessary for local decision making,
consistent with a respect for public accountability.<p>

<p>External challenges<br>Part B deals with external
challenges and threats to academic freedom and autonomy,
including those that arise from the relationship of the
universities with central government. Various safeguards and
structures to maintain academic freedom and autonomy are
suggested.  Some of these relate to: <br> the
functions of the new Tertiary Education Advisory Commission;
<br> ownership of the universities; <br> the
funding of research; <br> controversial teaching and
research; <br> the research relationship between the
university and the business community;<br>
institutions’ financial reporting requirements; <br>
developments in the World Trade Organisation; and 
<br> the activities of the Security Intelligence
Service<p>
<p>Internal challenges<br>Part C of the report
deals with internal challenges and threats to academic
freedom and autonomy. Recommendations here
include:<br> Universities should consider amplifying
the definition of academic freedom in the Education Act with
statements of their own, preferably in the collective
employment agreement with academic staff. <br>
Emphasis is placed on the distinction between executive and
legislative functions within the university and the roles of
the governing council, vice-chancellors, deans and other
academic administrators are examined.<br> The
statutory role of Vice-Chancellor as sole employer of staff
is seen as concentrating too much power in one person and it
is recommended that the function should be transferred to
the council.<p>

<p>Finally, the report notes that UNESCO, in
its recent policy statement on the status of higher
education teaching personnel, placed some emphasis on
collegial self-government as an essential operational part
of academic freedom. It considers that the academic boards
provide the key structure for this, notes that they have
become increasingly ineffectual, and suggests ways of
strengthening those
bodies.</p>
