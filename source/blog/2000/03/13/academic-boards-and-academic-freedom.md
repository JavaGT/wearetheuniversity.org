<p><img align="left" width="65" height="65" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/graphics/auslogo.gif" alt="AUS website" border="0"><br>Dr Donald Savage, a
Canadian higher education consultant and former adviser to
UNESCO, has completed his inquiry into academic freedom in
New Zealand for the Association of University Staff (AUS). 
His report includes some strong recommendations relating to
the role and function of academic boards.</p>

<p>Dr Savage
stresses the importance of staff and community involvement
in university governance for the protection of academic
freedom.  “Self-governing structures such as academic boards
play a key role in the defence of academic freedom,” says Dr
Savage.</p>

<p>Dr Savage recommends that academic boards should
be consulted by Vice-Chancellors and Councils on all
significant matters that touch on the academic enterprise,
including restructuring of academic faculties.</p>

<p>AUS
National President, Neville Blampied, welcomed Dr Savage’s
recommendations. “They support the decision of the Hamilton
High Court in 1999 which found that restructuring proposals
put forward by Vice-Chancellor, Bryan Gould, were not a
management prerogative, but were the responsibility of the
Waikato University Council after taking advice from the
academic board.”</p>

<p>“AUS intends to ensure that
academic boards are restored to their rightful place in
collegial decision making,” said Neville Blampied, “and that
the boards continue to be comprised of a majority of
academic staff not in senior management positions.<p>
<p>“In
doing so, we will seriously consider creative ideas, such as
Dr Savage’s recommendation that the academic board be
chaired by an independent person (rather than the
Vice-Chancellor as at present).</p>

<p>“We also agree with
Dr Savage that academic boards must also be fully involved
in financial decisions that have an impact upon academic
quality.</p>

<p>“The freedom of university staff to
develop, debate and publicise new and potentially
controversial ideas is a vital contribution to the knowledge
society,” said Neville Blampied.</p>
