Canadian higher education consultant who has recently
completed an inquiry into the state of academic freedom in
New Zealand sees the academic boards of the universities as
having a key role to play in ensuring that free discussion
can take place on campus.</p>

<p>“Academic freedom implies free
discussion and that can only take place in an open
atmosphere.  Closed doors are the enemy of free discussion,”
said Dr Savage from Ottawa today.</p>

<p>“One of the keys to
successfully functioning university governance structures is
a vigorous local policy in favour of openness.</p>

<p>“Academic
boards should therefore take a lead by investigating how
open their university actually is and how openness can be
extended in their institution,” he said.</p>

<p>“Academic boards
should also actively resist attempts by administrators to
impose external speech codes on staff and should play a key
role in policing the adoption of performance indicators,
particularly those that rely on mindless counting and
record-keeping instead of academic judgment.”</p>

<p>“All such
indicators should first be approved by the academic board,”
said Dr Savage.</p>
