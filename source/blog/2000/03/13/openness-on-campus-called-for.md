Canadian higher education consultant who has recently
completed an inquiry into the state of academic freedom in
New Zealand sees the academic boards of the universities as
having a key role to play in ensuring that free discussion
can take place on campus.</p>

<p>“Academic freedom implies free
discussion and that can only take place in an open
atmosphere.  Closed doors are the enemy of free discussion,”
said Dr Savage from Ottawa today.</p>

<p>“One of the keys to
successfully functioning university governance structures is
a vigorous local policy in favour of openness.</p>

<p>“Academic
boards should therefore take a lead by investigating how
open their university actually is and how openness can be
extended in their institution,” he said.</p>

<p>“Academic boards
should also actively resist attempts by administrators to
impose external speech codes on staff and should play a key
role in policing the adoption of performance indicators,
particularly those that rely on mindless counting and
record-keeping instead of academic judgment.”</p>

<p>“All such
indicators should first be approved by the academic board,”
said Dr Savage.</p>

<p>Dr Savage can be contacted on 001 613
521 3080  (please note that Ottawa is 18 Hours behind NZ
time).  He will also respond to questions sent to him by
email
at<br>dcsavage@sympatico.ca</p>
