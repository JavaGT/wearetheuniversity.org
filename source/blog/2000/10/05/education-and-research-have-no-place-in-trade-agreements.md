<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has today urged the Select Committee
hearing submissions on the proposed free trade and
investment agreement with Singapore to recommend against its
ratification.<p>

<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, told
the committee that the Association was strongly opposed to
the treating of tertiary education as a commodity and its
inclusion, along with research, in trade agreements.</p>

<p>“AUS
is seriously concerned about the proposed inclusion of
research in the agreement, and finds it extraordinary that
there has been no consultation with those engaged in such
research, notably academics,” said Mr Crozier.</p>

<p>“We are
also concerned about the future consequences for funding of
research through mechanisms such as the Marsden Fund, which
currently funds about 1 in 10 applications.</p>

<p>“Opening this
and other funds up to Singapore as a consequence of a free
trade agreement could have catastrophic effects on New
Zealand researchers,” he said.</p>

<p>“A further concern arises
in relation to the inclusion of mutual recognition of
qualifications.  Singapore makes it clear that it will not
recognise New Zealand degrees for the purposes of admission,
registration and qualification for professional practice in
Singapore.<p>

<p>“This means that there will be little
incentive for Singaporean students to study in New Zealand –
supposedly one of the justifications for the inclusion of
education in the first place,” said Mr Crozier.<p>
<p>“The
Government states that it is committed to the
nation-building role of the tertiary education sector.  It
should therefore exclude education from all trade agreements
in order to protect that policy position.”</p>

<p>“AUS strongly
supports international linkages in education and research
but not through the mechanism of trade
agreements.”</p>
