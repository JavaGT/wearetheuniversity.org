University are concerned that the University will not be
able to sustain a projected $4 million cut from the
operating budgets of its academic schools by the end of
2002.</p><p>"We appreciate the need for and desirability of the
University achieving a budget surplus," said Association of
University Staff branch spokesperson Guy Reynolds "but we
don't believe the figure of $4M across the schools can be
achieved without seriously undermining Victoria's academic
reputation."</p><p>"We have already seen cuts over the last year
in several of the schools and departments of the Science and
Humanities faculties.  Early retirements, redundancies, and
a rigorous rationalisation of academic, technical and
administrative functions in those faculties would suggest
there is little or no  'fat' left to shed," said Mr
Reynolds.  "However, if the University is determined to
reduce schools' costs by a further $4M to achieve its
projected $3M surplus this will almost certainly result in
the loss of around 50-70 jobs, probably including in some
cases courses and whole programmes." </p><p>Mr Reynolds
recognise that the combination of harsh government policies
and declining student enrolments are to a certain extent
forcing the University's hand.  However, he says that it's
"a bit rich of management to pronounce in their report on
the deficit reduction project that the decisions will 'not
involve a tradeoff between academic quality and revenue
generation' when this is currently the proposed fate of the
excellently performing Geology department and Antarctic
Research Centre".

<p>He said staff are "utterly dismayed" at
the fate of Geology and the Antarctic Research Centre in the
wake of the recently completed review of the School of Earth
Sciences.  "What hope can staff in the rest of the
University have for their continued survival," said Mr
Reynolds "if the consistently excellent teaching and
research record of Geology staff, and the internationally
admired work of the Antarctic Research Centre, can be so
readily disregarded by a management who seem to conclude
simply, 'You cost too much'".</p><p><br>Guy
