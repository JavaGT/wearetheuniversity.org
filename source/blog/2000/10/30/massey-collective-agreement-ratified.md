<p><img align="left" width="85" height="85" src="http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif" alt="AUS WEB SITE" border="0"><br>Massey University staff
unions ratified a one-year collective employment agreement
last Friday 27th October.  Although staff gained a 1.7% wage
increase, this becomes effective upon ratification rather
than being backdated to the expiry of the previous contract
in July.</p>

<p>Staff were pleased that management finally agreed
to their suggestion to further assist those people leaving
Massey as a result of the redundancies this year.  The
University is accordingly establishing an Employment
Assistance Fund of $250,000 administered jointly by the
Unions and management, to which those leaving can apply for
grants of up to $10,000.<p>

<p>"We also got management to
withdraw proposed clawbacks in retirement clauses, which we
thought was a significant gain given this year's push to be
rid of staff.  Management also agreed to a workloads clause
that requires workload allocations which are 'transparent,
equitable, flexible and that promote the wellbeing and
safety of staff'," said newly elected AUS Massey President
Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>

<p>"Despite these gains, 16% of AUS members
voted to continue industrial action.  This is the highest
level of dissent against a settlement with management that
we have ever encountered.  I think this has to be taken as a
message to management that they will encounter stiff demands
when this agreement expires a year from now.  Staff are
still angry about the management style at Massey University,
and staff will work toward the collegial model of university
governance," said Dr Rhodes.</p>
