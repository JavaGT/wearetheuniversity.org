<p>22 December 1999</p>

<p>Media release - for immediate
release</p>

<p>Waikato Court decision to stand</p>

<p>The Association
of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed Waikato University
Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould's decision to abandon his appeal
against the High Court decision, which struck down his
proposed restructuring of parts of the University.</p>

<p>"The
Association was always confident that the judgment was
legally correct and that the Vice-Chancellor did not have
the managerial powers he claimed.  We are pleased that
Professor Gould has now accepted that", said AUS National
President, Professor Jane Kelsey.</p>

<p>"Staff concerns
about managerial excesses are not confined to Waikato and
this case had resonance throughout the country.  At Victoria
University, similar criticism was a significant factor in
the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor Professor Irving,
announced yesterday.  Problems exist at most other New
Zealand universities.</p>

<p>"Professor Gould's decision is a
timely recognition that current university management
practices will have to change.  The Government has made it
plain that market-driven competition is to end and that
universities are to return to their traditional functions
and values.<p>

<p>"The AUS welcomes that shift, and will work
hard to ensure that the Vice-Chancellors implement the
necessary changes.  We will work constructively and
positively with them towards that end," said Professor
Kelsey.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Professor Kelsey can be contacted on 021 680
