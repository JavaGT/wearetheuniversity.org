release</p>

<p><br>Victoria University urged to 'get it right'
next time</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) is
urging Victoria University's Council to ensure that the
process for appointing a replacement for departing
Vice-Chancellor, Michael Irving, is open and
democratic.</p>

<p>AUS President, Professor Jane Kelsey, said in
Wellington today that as the Vice-Chancellor was the
Council's only employee, there could be no excuses for
getting the process wrong.</p>

<p>"It is important for Victoria
to return to its traditional academic values and to hire a
Vice-Chancellor who can provide the necessary academic
leadership rather than a focus on narrow managerialism."<p>

<p>"Staff at Victoria will now face a further unsettling
time until a new Vice-Chancellor arrives.  Council must move
quickly to stem the growing number of staff departures and
provide students with the certainty that they will receive a
first-class university education," she said.</p>

<p>"The new
Government has clearly signalled that the era of
market-driven competition in tertiary education is over. 
This is therefore a golden opportunity for Victoria
University to rediscover the traditional nature of the
university."</p>
