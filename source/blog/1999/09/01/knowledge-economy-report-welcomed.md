<p>A report into New Zealand's status as a Knowledge Economy
has been welcomed by Information Technology Minister Maurice
Williamson today.</p>

<p>Provided by his Information Technology
Advisory Group (ITAG) in association with the Information
Technology Association of New Zealand (ITANZ), the report
reflects the discussions Mr Williamson has had with ITAG
over the last 18 months.</p>

<p>"I'm pleased it has come out soon
after our Bright Future announcements which dealt with a
number of issues the report raised. I support the sense of
urgency the report contains as it's an excellent
reinforcement of the steps the Government is already
taking."</p>

<p>Mr Williamson said the Government was currently
working on how to attract more science and technology
graduates, attracting skilled migrants and strengthening
research and development (R&amp;D).</p>

<p>"I was encouraged by the
recent release of the New Zealand Research and Experimental
Development Statistics 1997/98 which showed that business
R&amp;D had increased by 30 percent over two years. It also
showed that New Zealand had one of the highest R&amp;D growth
rates in the OECD.</p>

<p>The Knowledge Economy Report
highlighted a need to improve the information and
communication technology (ICT) of both teachers and students
and have this as a bursary subject to encourage more
students to take up science and technology at tertiary
level.</p>

<p>"This point is well placed and one I'm progressing
with my colleague, the Minister of Education."</p>

<p>Mr
Williamson said students were not the only ones who should
be using the Knowledge Economy report to help them decide on
what areas to train in.<p>
<p>"Businesses and workers who are
interested in improving their profitability and
employability need to be looking at how IT is affecting
their jobs, industries and investment in training and
upskilling."</p>

<p>"The Knowledge Economy also provides
excellent opportunities for Maori to overcome current social
and economic disadvantage, because IT will increase the
range and number of jobs in both cities and less populated
areas."</p>

<p>Mr Williamson said the Knowledge Economy Report
was an excellent reinforcement of steps the Government had
already taken and a forceful reminder not to let up on the
speed and focus of repositioning New
Zealand.</p>
