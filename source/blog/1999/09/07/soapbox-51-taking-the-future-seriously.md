<dl><dt><strong>Taking the future
seriously</strong></dt><br><dt><small><em>Matthew
Thomas</em></small></dt><br><dt><small><cite>Soapbox
0051</cite></small></dt></dl><p>At the end of last month,
the Government's Information Technology Advisory Group
released its <cite>The knowledge economy</cite>
report.</p>

<p>The report makes very interesting reading, even if
the constant comparisons between the development of
refrigerated shipping of the 19th century and the
development of the Internet in the 20th century do get on
your nerves. I myself find the constant use of the phrase
`knowledge economy' to be somewhat unnerving in itself,
especially when it is used by people who don't really know
-- or care -- what it means. But more of that in a
moment.</p>

<p>The report itself has some disturbing things to
say about New Zealand. We have, it seems, has dropped the
ball in the race to create an economy which will make us
better off in the next century. New Zealand has a woeful
record on IT education, and one of the worst tax
environments for privately funded <abbr title="research and
development">R&amp;D</abbr> in the <abbr title="Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development">OECD</abbr>. And
because our economy is still centred on primary industries,
and we're still to some extent stuck in the 1950s mindset of
being the bread basket of the world, we risk turning into
the basket case of the world. Or as the report itself puts
it: `If New Zealanders do not seize the opportunities
provided by the knowledge economy, we will survive only as
an amusement park and holiday land for the citizens of more
successful developed economies'.<p>
<p>The simple facts are
these. Concentrating on primary industries such as forestry,
meat, and fruit production is not the way to generate wealth
in the 21st century, because such goods can almost always be
produced more cheaply elsewhere. Fiddling around with
biotechnology or organic production can help these primary
industries to some extent, but the real industries of the
future are those involving the production, analysis, and
communication of information. Computer hardware and
software, Internet development, telecommunications, and
other high-technology goods are the sort of industries which
New Zealand must invest in, and quickly, if we are not to be
left behind.</p>

<p>What's disappointing about the
<cite>Knowledge economy</cite> report is that it doesn't
have much to offer in the way of concrete suggestions for
the Government on how it can bring New Zealand into this
knowledge economy. There are, to be sure, some good ideas on
how to improve education in the field of information
technology. And there are lots of vague ideas about
`removing obstacles', `championing the way ahead', `setting
out a vision and a clear direction', and so on. But that's
about it.</p>

<p>So, in this election year, the onus falls on
political parties to tell us what they would do, or are
doing, in Government to encourage the knowledge economy. And
this is where things get worrying.</p>

<p>The Government claimed
to have the knowledge economy problem licked last month,
with its announcement of the `Bright Future: Five steps
ahead' package. Indeed, <abbr title="Information
Technology">IT</abbr> minister Maurice Williamson said that
<abbr title="Information Technology Advisory
Group">ITAG</abbr>'s  <cite>Knowledge economy</cite> report
was `an excellent reinforcement of the steps the Government
is already taking'.</p>

<p>But really, the Bright Future package
was distinctly underwhelming: the plethora of press releases
which surrounded the release of the package was, perhaps,
the most impressive thing about it. Because these `five
steps ahead' weren't really anything specifically to do with
knowledge industries.</p>

<p>To see what I mean, just take a look
at the five steps, as described by Bill English on the day
of the launch of the programme. First, there's maintaining
the Government's current economic policy. Second, there's
cutting taxes. Third, there's `making the economy more
competitive'. Fourthly, there's `considering' the role of
Government in the knowledge economy. And fifthly, `offering
more choice and flexibility to everyone who uses public
services'.</p>

<p>When I read these five steps, I was so excited
I almost fell asleep. I mean, really. Is this supposed to be
the kind of visionary stuff that will lead New Zealand into
the next century? Do these five steps even sound much like
they show any commitment to the knowledge economy at all? Or
are they just the same old National Party policy, dressed up
in the emperor's new clothes?</p>

<p>Labour, meanwhile, is just
as bad. The party's commerce spokesperson, Paul Swain, said
last month that Labour will make the move of New Zealand to
a knowledge-based economy `the centre-piece of its economic
policy', but it doesn't seem to have a clear direction on
how to get there. Labour's industry development policy paper
includes the breathtaking assertion that `New Zealand's
future depends on our ability to build a knowledge-driven
economy', but it doesn't offer any obvious
knowledge-industry-specific measures -- such as increasing
Government's use of the Internet and other information
technology, for example.</p>

<p>And the minor parties don't offer
much hope either. The Alliance responded to the Bright
Future package by claiming that the best way of creating a
knowledge economy was making tertiary education free, and
ACT criticized how much the programme would cost. Both
utterly predictable, and both, really, missing the
point.</p>

<p>What's my interest in this? Well, all going
according to plan, at the end of this year I should have
completed a Bachelor of Commerce degree -- majoring in
Computer Science. I'm one of the too-few information
technology graduates a year which the report talks about.
And I am afraid.</p>

<p>I am afraid that in order to get a decent
job, I will have to leave New Zealand -- that I will have to
go to Australia, or the United States, or Europe, in order
to find a position which doesn't undervalue my skills.</p>

<p>And I don't want to have to do that. Because I happen to
like it here.</p>
