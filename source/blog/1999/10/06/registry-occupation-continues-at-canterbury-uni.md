<p><strong>Registry occupation continues at University of
Canterbury</strong></p>

<p><cite>Matthew Thomas</cite></p>

<p>Staff
arriving for work at the University of Canterbury Registry
have been turned away by students this morning, as an
occupation of the Registry continues.</p>

<p>The occupation began
at 2 pm yesterday, after a noisy hour-long rally against fee
rises which was attended by about 3000 students.</p>

<p>The rally
heard from several speakers -- including outgoing president
of the University of Canterbury Students Association, Darel
Hall, president-elect Jarrod Gilbert, and representatives of
academic staff -- who all said they were against the fee
rises. The crowd gave a hostile reception to a speech by the
Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Daryl LeGrew,
who has proposed a fee rise of an average of 45 percent,
from the previous flat fee of $3210 per year.</p>

<p>Professor
LeGrew's proposal includes uncapping of fees, so that
students such as engineers, who typically take more than a
full-time course each year, would pay more than other
students. The proposal also includes the introduction of
differentiated fees, with science and engineering students
paying more than commerce and arts students.</p>

<p>Professor
LeGrew said that the Government was under-funding the
University by over $100 million, that fees have previously
been kept low by using cash reserves which are now no longer
available, and that the fee rise was necessary to maintain
academic standards. Student representatives have argued that
LeGrew is using Government under-funding as an excuse to
raise fees by more than is necessary, to pay for lavish
renovations of administration facilities and a new computer
system.<p>
<p>At the end of the rally, with students outside
chanting `Let us in', a group of students found their way
into the ground floor of the Registry, and unlocked the
doors to the crowd outside. Around two hundred students
entered the building, occupying all six storeys. A group of
around one hundred students stayed in the Registry
overnight.</p>

<p>Inside the Registry, there is the appearance
more of a youth hostel than an administration building.
Students sit in groups, playing cards or board games, and
discussing media coverage of the occupation. Banners reading
`No more fee rises' and `Enough is enough' fly from windows
on the sixth floor, and the main doors to the Registry are
festooned with protest placards.<p>

<p>University security
guards have remained in the building, with the cooperation
of the students, to guard student and administration
records. Registry staff who turned up for work this morning
have met in a nearby building to wait until the occupation
finishes. Students are currently discussing who to let into
the Registry -- University spokespeople have asked to speak
to the students inside the Registry, and the publishers of
the official University weekly the <cite>Canterbury
Chronicle</cite> are also seeking to enter.</p>

<p>The University
Council is meeting at 3 o'clock this afternoon in the
University's Ngaio Marsh Theatre, to finalize the fees for
next year. It is expected that some of the students
occupying the Registry will march to the meeting, while
others will continue the occupation. A meeting of students
to decide whether to continue the occupation will be held
following the Council meeting.</p>

<p>This is the second
occupation of the Registry in the past month. Earlier, a
smaller group of students occupied the building in protest
against less severe fee rise proposals, and a petition
calling for a zero fee increase has since been signed by
over 6500 students.</p>
