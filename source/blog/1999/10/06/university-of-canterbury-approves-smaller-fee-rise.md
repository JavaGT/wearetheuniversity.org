<p><strong>University of Canterbury approves smaller fee
rise</strong></p>

<p><cite>Matthew Thomas</cite></p>

<p>In a packed
meeting, the University Council of the University of
Canterbury has just approved fee rises to generate an
additional $8.8 million income next year.</p>

<p>The fees motion,
which was a reduction of an earlier proposal to raise an
additional $13 million from fees, appeared to be agreed to
by almost all councillors in the oral vote, with only the
two Students Association representatives -- president Darel
Hall, and executive member Kyle Millar -- voting against
it.</p>

<p>In a long presentation, during which an electronic
ticker on the stage showed New Zealand student debt climbing
close to $3.63 billion, University vice-chancellor Professor
Daryl LeGrew stressed that the financial situation of the
University was perilous. `Without financial reform, the
University may be in a high-risk situation', he
said.</p>

<p>Professor LeGrew said that at current funding and
expenditure levels, there would be a shortfall of $19
million, and he placed the blame for the shortfall at the
feet of the Government: `the Government is  short-changing
this university, as it has been short-changing other
universities'.</p>

<p>LeGrew proposed that $8.8 million of the
shortfall be met by increased fees, with the remaining $7.2
million coming from cost savings.</p>

<p>Several councillors
expressed concern at the steepness of even the modified
proposal, but most said they saw it as necessary for the
continuing viability of the University.<p>
<p>As part of the
decision, University of Canterbury fees will now be uncapped
and differentiated. Five bands will be introduced: ranging
from arts students in Band 1, paying $3410 (up 6 percent),
to engineering and some science students in Band 5, paying
$4210 (up 30 percent).</p>

<p>This is less extreme than an
earlier proposal put forward by Professor LeGrew, which
student representatives said would have led to an average
fee rise of 45 percent. The original proposal led to an
occupation of the university registry by hundreds of
students, after a rally against fee increases yesterday
afternoon.</p>

<p>The students are now meeting to decide whether
to continue the occupation.</p>
