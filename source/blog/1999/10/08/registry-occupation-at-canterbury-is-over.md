<p><strong>Registry occupation at Canterbury is
over</strong></p>

<p><cite>Matthew Thomas</cite></p>

<p>After some 53
hours, the student occupation of the registry building at
the University of Canterbury is over.</p>

<p>The occupation ended
at about 7 pm, after extended negotiations between student
representatives, members of the Association of University
Staff (AUS), University vice-chancellor Daryl LeGrew, and
other University officials.</p>

<p>University of Canterbury
Students Association president-elect Jarrod Gilbert said
that Professor LeGrew had agreed to three proposals put
forward by the students and AUS.</p>

<p>Firstly,
vice-chancellors, students, and academic staff from all New
Zealand universities will take part in a conference in
mid-November, to present a united view to politicians on the
subject of university funding.</p>

<p>Secondly, Mr Gilbert said
Professor LeGrew had given assurances that student fees
would not rise, between 2000 and 2001, by any more than
could be excused by inflation or by a reduction in
Government funding.</p>

<p>And thirdly, he said academic staff
have been given assurances that cost-cutting moves carried
out by the university will not affect lecturer-to-student
ratios.</p>

<p>The registry occupation began at 2 pm on Tuesday,
after a protest rally against what students described as a
45-percent average fee increase. A smaller increase, of
between 6 percent and 33 percent depending on the course,
was approved by the University Council on Wednesday
afternoon. At a rally following the University Council
meeting, students decided to continue the occupation for a
second night.<p>
<p>Shortly after 9 o'clock this morning, in
keeping with a prior agreement with the occupiers,
University officials gave a warning that they were about to
call the police. Students swarmed into the registry to help
resist any eviction attempt, swelling numbers inside the
building to several hundred. Some lecturers reportedly ended
their lectures immediately and encouraged their students to
join the occupation. The police never arrived.</p>

<p>A rally at
midday today attracted more students to the occupation. It
also attracted a number of politicians to speak, including
the leader of the Alliance, Jim Anderton, as well as
representatives from New Zealand First, Labour, and
National.</p>

<p>The New Zealand First and Labour representatives
were heckled by some students, and National's spokesperson,
Christchurch Central candidate John Stringer, was shouted
down completely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, negotiations between students
and the vice-chancellor broke down this morning, but were
restarted at 2 o'clock this afternoon, resulting in this
evening's agreement.</p>

<p>Jarrod Gilbert said he was pleased
with what the occupation had achieved. `I think it's a great
result', he said.</p>

<p>`We came to the negotiating table with
three things ... we've got those three things. And the fees
aren't as high as we were expecting, as well.'</p>

<p>The
placards and banners have gone from the Registry building,
along with the students. No longer is the sound of dance
music coming from the sixth floor. No longer are all
visitors to the Registry challenged at the door. And no
longer are the rooms littered with sleeping bags, backpacks,
and newspapers.</p>

<p>And now, the only people occupying the
Registry are the security guards -- and the
cleaners.</p>
