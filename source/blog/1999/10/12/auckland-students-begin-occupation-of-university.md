         Compiled by Selwyn Manning</p><p>Another student occupation
began at Auckland University at around 12.30 this afternoon
when about 100 students stormed the Old Arts Building.
</p><p>They are calling for the Auckland University Council to
announce no fee rises for next year. </p><p>Fee setting at
Auckland is to get under way in the middle of exam time. The
students are building on last week's protest action at
Victoria and Canterbury universities.</p><p>Education is fast
becoming a thorn in the side of the National minority
Government. Last week it moved to appease anger from
students over compounding terciary interest rates. But any
moves this close to the general election are bound to be
viewed cynically.</p><p>The focus of today's Auckland rally will
be the smashing of a debt wall, a symbolic representation of
the $3billion that students collectively owe to the loans
scheme, although other actions have also been foreshadowed.
</p><p>“The success of the Canterbury occupation has given a
clear indication to students how they can fight back against
the continuation of underfunding in the tertiary sector.
Students were able to force the university to back down from
a 45% fee increase, saving an average of $800 per student,”
said Kane Forbes, student protest organiser.</p><p>“This is the
single biggest concession ever won for students and now
Auckland students must act to ensure that our own fees are
not subjected to huge fee increases. Our University Council
has deliberately decided to set fees after students have
left campus for the year. A clear attempt to silence
students. This protest is about making sure that we will not
be silenced,” concluded Kane Forbes.

<p>Meanwhile, Karen
Skinner Co-President of the New Zealand University Students’
Association (NZUSA) said today: “University councils
attempts to silence students by placing fee setting during
exam time has not succeeded.”</p><p>Two more campus’s are today
taking action against growing student fees and debt. At
Auckland, students have smashed a ‘wall of debt’ and are now
occupying part of their University. At Otago students will
be ‘attending’ their University council meeting at
2pm.</p><p>“Our fight is not just with the University, but with
the government who has continually failed to deal with the
growing tertiary education crisis” said Ms Skinner. “Jenny
Shipley and the National party have created a debt time
bomb. Young people are beginning to suffer the
consequences.”</p><p>“We challenge Jenny Shipley and Max
Bradford to tell the public when they project that the level
of student debt will stop growing. Student debt is currently
at over $3 billion. How much do we have to owe before the
government will admit that the scheme is out of control and
increase funding to our Universities?” concluded Ms
Skinner.</p><p></p><p></p><p>
