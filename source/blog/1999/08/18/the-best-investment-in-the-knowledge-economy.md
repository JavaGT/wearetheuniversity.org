<p><b>The best investment in the knowledge economy is free
education.</b></p>

<p>Liz Gordon MP Wed Aug 18 1999</p>

<p><img src="http://www.alliance.org.nz/pics/electorates/06Liz_Gordon_MP.jpg" border="0" align="left" valign="top" alt="Liz Gordon
MP"> The Alliance said the best way to invest in the
knowledge economy is to make tertiary education free rather
than to patch up the user pays system which turns people
away from studying science and technology.</p>

<p>'Another costly
review is not needed to tell us that the best way to invest
in the knowledge economy is to remove barriers to learning
and make tertiary education free,' Alliance Education
spokesperson Dr Liz Gordon said.</p>

<p>'All the signals the
government sends to students though it's userpays education
system discourage students from taking science and
technology courses. The scholarships for postgraduate
students will not change this pattern if potential science
undergraduate students cannot afford a science
career.</p>

<p>'Average fees for commerce students this year are
between $2,650 and $3,500 whereas science fees this year
range between $3,120 and $3,900 between 11 and 18% higher.<p>

<p>'At the same time graduate starting salaries for commerce
students were between $40,000 and $48,000. Science students
only earnt between $28,500 and $38,000, 21 to 29%
lower.</p>

<p>'For young people deciding to do a degree and
wanting to pay off a student loan of at least $20,000 the
choice of a science degree over a commerce degree is a brave
one.<p>
<p>'The student loans scheme is now in its eighth year.
250,000 students owe $3 billion. Many of these students are
leaving the country with huge loans never to return, not
just because they can avoid their debt but because they can
earn much more overseas.</p>

<p>'This government has given away
tax cuts worth $2,500 million per year. Free education would
cost about $500 million a year. Free education would cost a
fifth of the cost of the tax cuts. These figures clearly
show that this government's priorities are not in developing
the knowledge economy.</p>

<p>'The Alliance's partnership 2000
plan to invest in science research and technology far
surpasses the government 5 point reelection plan. In
conjunction with the Alliance tertiary education policy to
be announced shortly we are investing in the knowledge
economy where it really counts,' Alliance Education
spokesperson Liz Gordon
said.<br><p>
