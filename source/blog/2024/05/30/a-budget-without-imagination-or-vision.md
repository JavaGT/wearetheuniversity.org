<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is still
waiting for a Budget that will solve any of the real issues
faced by the tertiary education sector.</p>

<p>Minister of
Finance Nicola Willis talked a lot about reprioritisation in
her Budget 2024 speech.</p>

<p>But Te Pou Ahurei | National
Secretary Sandra Grey says “the Budget reprioritises the
burden of keeping tertiary education funding in line with
inflation onto students, with their fees set to increase by
6% to offset a miserable 2.5% increase in SAC
funding.”</p>

<p>“Along with the removal of fees free
from the first year of study, this is a Budget that will
limit opportunities, block pathways, increase inequalities
and remove the ability of many young people from low-income
families to see a future for themselves – all to allow the
sector to stand still.”</p>

<p>“This Budget lacks
imagination and vision. It does nothing to deliver more well
educated and highly skilled workers like builders, plumbers,
hairdressers, mechanics, and engineers for our economic
wellbeing.”</p>

<p>“Real cuts to funding over the next
three years will result in communities losing local
provision. The abolition of Workforce Development Councils
will remove employer voice from decisions that impact their
future.”</p>

<p>“Our students who will be our future
nurses and doctors will borrow more, our institutions will
have fewer staff and the quality of education will continue
to suffer.”</p>

<p>“The Minister seems to think moving
fees free to the final year of study will encourage
completion. It won’t. What stops students from completing
study is rent, food, transportation, need to work, and
mental health.”</p>

<p>“In real terms, because of this
Budget, our workers are worse off, our students are worse
off, our employers are worse off, and our institutions are
worse off. We all need to join the fight-back and stand up
for our
future.”</p>
