	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union has
written to five of the eight university employers to
commence renewal of the collective employment agreements our
union negotiates across these workplaces.</p><p>The Vice
Chancellors of Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa | Massey University,
Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University, Te Whare Wānaka o
Aoraki | Lincoln University, Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha |
The University of Canterbury and Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka |
The University of Otago all received ‘initiation
notices’ today.</p><p>The last time these agreements were
all negotiated together, in 2022, there was widespread
industrial action across all eight of Aotearoa’s
universities which attracted nationwide media attention as
staff demanded pay increases to match inflation.</p><p>Te
Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra Grey says TEU members
across the university sector remain unified and determined
to improve their terms and conditions of
employment.</p><p>“Many universities are reporting
surpluses and they all have choices about where they invest
their considerable operating budgets.”</p><p>“Two years
ago we highlighted the fact that they have been spending
less and less of their operating expenditure on staff. That
trend has continued. The vice chancellors have been
prioritising buildings over people and that has got to
stop.”</p><p>“Our message to Aotearoa’s university
employers, as we head into collective agreement
negotiations, is very simple: you must start putting people
first, and investing the vast majority of the public money
entrusted to you into staffing.”</p>

<p>“We cannot afford
to lose any more good staff because their pay is falling
behind inflation while their workloads keep
growing.”</p><p>Negotiations will be initiated at Waipapa
Taumata Rau | The University of Auckland in two months’
time. Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato | The University of
Waikato and Te Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki Makau Rau | Auckland
University of Technology have been in the process renewing
their collective agreements since late last
year.</p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
