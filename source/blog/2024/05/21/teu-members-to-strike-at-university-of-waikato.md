         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union members
will strike at Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato | The University
of Waikato on Friday, following eight months of
negotiations, and a mediation session, that have yielded
little movement from the employer.</p><p>Kaiwhakahaere |
Organiser Shane Vugler says negotiations have “hit a
wall.”</p><p>“The university has budgeted for a $24
million increase in revenue in 2024, of which only $4
million is allocated to salary improvement. Since the budget
was set, between $6-7 million is being cut from personnel
costs through restructuring, redundancy, enhanced retirement
and a hiring freeze.”</p><p>“As a result of these
austerity measures, compounded by previous cuts and a
significant increase in student numbers this year, our
members’ workloads have grown
exponentially.”</p><p>“Over the course of negotiations,
TEU have reduced our claim significantly, and it now sits at
5%. Meanwhile, after eight months at the table, the
university has only increased their offer by 0.1% to an
anaemic 2.85% (or 3.5% if we agree to a delayed increase
which would deliver less money than the 2.85% offer over the
full term of the agreement).”</p><p>“Our 5% claim fits
within their $4 million budget for salary increases if they
also agree to a three-month delay before they pass the
increase on to non-members, who do not do any of the mahi or
pay the union fees that enable us to
negotiate.”</p><p>“Our members are rightly very angry,
and they call on the Vice Chancellor to send his team back
to the table with a mandate to increase their
offer.”</p><p>The strike will run for 3.5hrs from
9am-12:30pm on Friday and will include a rally outside the
Pā at
11:30am.</p>
