<p>In an extraordinary step, Auditor-General John Ryan has
written
an open letter to Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato | The
University of Waikato Chancellor Rt Hon Sir Anand Satyanand
to make serious criticisms of the university’s procurement
processes.</p>

<p>The Auditor General says his office has
“not been provided with any formal record, such as a
business case or procurement plan (or equivalent document),
that sets out the services that were needed and how the
procurement would be done. We have also not been provided
with a satisfactory explanation or analysis and
documentation to support the Vice-Chancellor’s view that
the contractor was the only suitable option to deliver the
services.”</p>

<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education
Union Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Shane Vugler shares the
Auditor General’s concerns. “Procurement policies and
processes are there to protect universities and state sector
organisations from accusations of corruption and/or
reputational a damage from the perception of
corruption.”</p>

<p>“When a Vice Chancellor uses his
power, as the Auditor General puts it, “to put the usual
[procurement] processes to one side” then as a consequence
he puts the university’s integrity and reputation at
risk.”</p>

<p>“While the university continues to pay
Joyce Advisory Limited undisclosed sums of money for
undocumented services and outcomes, he is cutting $6-7
million out of the university’s personnel costs. These
cuts undermine the scope and quality of programmes we are
able to deliver to students at the University of Waikato.
They also significantly increase workloads of staff at a
time when student numbers have increased
significantly.”</p>

<p>TEU members call on the Chancellor
to take action, particularly in light of the Auditor
General’s damning observation that “the University does
not seem to appreciate that it is accountable to Parliament
and the public for whether it has followed appropriate
processes when spending public money.”</p>

<p>Vugler says
“it’s time for the Vice Chancellor to be held
accountable.”</p>

<p>TEU will follow up with the Minister,
TEC and the Chancellor to clarify next
steps.</p>
