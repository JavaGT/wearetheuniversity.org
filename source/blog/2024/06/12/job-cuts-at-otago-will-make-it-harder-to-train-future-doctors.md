<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union was
dismayed to receive a management of change proposal from
Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka | The University of Otago last week
that, if implemented, would result in significant job losses
in the School of Biomedical Sciences.</p>

<p>The school has
been required by the Acting Health Sciences Pro-Vice
Chancellor to find $7.1 million in savings, but
Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Phil Edwards says this is
nonsensical given the school performs well financially and
returns a high proportion of its income back to university
coffers.</p>

<p>“This is a penny-pinching exercise that
will do lasting damage to a part of the university that more
than pays its way, is projected to grow its enrolments and
plays an important role in training future doctors – a
profession the country is desperate for more
of.”</p>

<p>"The government’s Budget has contributed to
this state of affairs, where the country is crying out for
more doctors but universities do not have the funding to
train them. New funding was only provided for an additional
25 doctors a year across the Otago and Auckland medical
schools".</p>

<p>“If the proposed changes go ahead we will
see fewer staff teaching a growing number of students which
will put the quality of education and research at risk,
which will in turn impact on future financial
viability.”</p>

<p>“We are also deeply concerned that the
proposed selection criteria, which is weighted against early
career academics, will result in future shortages of people
who can teach and research in this strategically vital
area.”</p>

<p>“We call on the university to halt this
review immediately and work with staff on more sensible
options for addressing the university’s financial
pressures.”</p>
