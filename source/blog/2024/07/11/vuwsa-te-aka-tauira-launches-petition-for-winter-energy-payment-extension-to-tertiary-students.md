	 <p>
         </p><p>At 10 am today, VUWSA - Te Aka Tauira launched a petition
urging the Government to extend the Winter Energy Payment to
include tertiary students.</p><p>"Energy companies are
announcing record profits while students are ending up in
the hospital with respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia,"
said VUWSA’s Equity Officer Josh Robinson. "This
experience is often seen as a rite of passage for students,
but in 2024, it is untenable."</p><blockquote><p>The Winter
Energy Payment is crucial for those struggling with the cost
of living to keep their homes warm and dry across Aotearoa.
Yet, tertiary students remain ineligible for this support,
despite living in some of the poorest conditions in
Aotearoa, in the coldest and dampest accommodations, and on
highly strained incomes. Access to the Winter Energy Payment
would help end the need for students to choose between a
warm home and food.</p></blockquote><p>“No one should have
to choose between staying warm and having food,” said
VUWSA President Marcail Parkinson. “It’s completely
unacceptable that in 2024 we still see students frequently
end up in the hospital with preventable respiratory
illnesses due to the quality of their accommodation. We know
that students live in some of the worst accommodations in
Aotearoa and have highly strained incomes as well as large
student loans. I applaud the incredible achievements of the
Winter Energy Payment so far in helping those who cannot
afford to keep their homes warm. However, I urge the
government to fix the student-sized hole in this support net
as soon as possible if they truly want a healthy and engaged
population of learners.”</p>

<p>Students shared their
personal stories about how receiving the Winter Energy
Payment would impact their lives. One student expressed, "I
wouldn’t wake up shivering in my bed each morning."
Another highlighted a common dilemma, saying, "I wouldn't
have to choose between heating and food." The stark reality
was underscored by a student who shared, "I wouldn't get
hypothermia... again."</p><p>The Winter Energy Payment,
introduced in 2017 by the then Labour Government, has been
available to all beneficiary groups except students. This
petition aims to rectify this oversight and ensure that
students are not left out in the cold.</p><p>The launch of
this petition coincided with VUWSA’s highly successful
annual Winter Clothing Drive, an initiative coordinated with
VUW Student Finance. The Clothing Drive provides donated
winter clothing from staff to all students free of charge.
This initiative, started in 2023, aims to alleviate student
hardship during winter and provide students with clothing
and bedding to keep themselves warm and healthy.</p><p>Te
