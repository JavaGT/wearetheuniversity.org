<p>A fresh round of staff cuts announced this week at the
University of Waikato is expected to be the first of many
across the university sector according to Te Hautū
Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union.</p>

<p>In a document
emailed to staff on Monday, Pro Vice Chancellor Patrick
Leman wrote that “Arts, Law, Psychology and Social
Sciences has a savings target of $1.3m against projected
revenue and spend.” He went on to state that
reorganisation “could be followed by a careful
consideration of staffing in new Schools and a further
review process to identify further potential
savings.”</p>

<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Shane Vugler
says “the initial proposal indicates a small number of job
losses amongst deans, school managers and school
administrators and we are expecting this to be followed up
by a second stage that will target academic staff and have a
greater impact on FTE. We also expect further restructuring
in other faculties that will aim to balance the
books.”</p>

<p>The university’s most recent annual report
showed a deficit of $16.8 million. Four other universities
are projecting significant deficits, which the union
predicts will lead to yet more cuts that will have an impact
on the provision of quality public education.</p>

<p>Vugler
says “the most disturbing thing about all this is the
University of Waikato is expecting significant enrolment
growth in both domestic and international students this year
– it’s a time when they should be growing not cutting.
Fewer staff and more students could spell disaster for our
members, who tell us they are already overwhelmed by high
workloads.”</p>

<p>“This from a university that has
heavily committed itself to an expensive and unnecessary new
medical school that it will be stretched to deliver. It
would be well advised to ditch that idea and focus on
maintaining the programmes it already runs and the staff who
deliver
them.”</p>
