	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
becoming increasingly troubled by the behaviour of Minister
of Tertiary Education and Skills Penny Simmonds.</p><p>In a
lengthy interview on Radio NZ yesterday, Simmonds indicated
(amongst other things) that she expects as many as ten
standalone polytechnics by the end of 2025, that there will
be significant job losses, and that viability would be
achieved through selling assets and more online
learning.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei Takirua – Ahumahi |
Assistant National Secretary – Industrial, Daniel
Benson-Guiu says “the Minister is making all this up as
she goes along.”</p><p>“Penny Simmonds created a
proposal document, set a timeframe for community feedback,
sent officials around the country to engage at the
taxpayer’s expense yet she has clearly predetermined the
outcomes of this sham
consultation.”</p><blockquote><p>“It’s deeply
concerning that the Minister is interfering with how the
sector is run by ignoring advice from officials,
foreshadowing job cuts and asset sales, and pushing students
towards online delivery whether it works for them or
not.”</p></blockquote><p>“We have repeatedly asked for
the information we need for our members to understand what
is being proposed and give meaningful, constructive feedback
but the Minister is refusing to respond directly to us as
one of the sector’s key stakeholders.”</p><p>"She is not
acting in good faith."</p><p>"It’s time for the Prime
Minister to bring Penny Simmonds into line. She is no longer
the Chief Executive of a small regional Polytechnic. If she
can’t act in the best interests of the entire tertiary
education sector and Aotearoa’s future workforce then she
should be moved aside for someone who
can.”</p>
