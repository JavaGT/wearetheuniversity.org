<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary
Education Union members at six universities came together in
force at paid union meetings yesterday, and called for a
strike vote.</p>

<p>If members vote to strike, it will be the
biggest show of force in the tertiary education sector since
7,000 union members at all eight universities took
action in 2022.</p>

<p>Members at Waipapa Taumata Rau |
The University of Auckland, Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa |
Massey University, Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University, Te
Whare Wānaka o Aoraki | Lincoln University, Te Whare
Wānanga o Waitaha | The University of Canterbury and
Ōtākou Whakaihu Waka | The University of Otago
overwhelmingly expressed their frustration with slow
progress in pay negotiations.</p>

<p>TEU, along with other
unions at some universities, have tabled claims for a 6% pay
increase and for wages and salaries for the lowest paid
members to be no lower than the Living Wage. Current
employer offers for general pay increases range from 1.5% to
3%.</p>

<p>Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary Sandra Grey
says university staff have been undervalued for far too
long. “Pay growth in the sector has been much slower than
the rest of the Aotearoa workforce, at a time when inflation
has been at 30-year highs.”</p>

<p>“We’re talking about
academic staff, but also about administrators, librarians,
security staff, gardeners, and many other professions, some
of whom are paid below the living wage. That’s
unacceptable. Nobody in Aotearoa, let alone working at a
university, should be paid less than what it costs to
live.”</p>

<p>A TEU member at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha |
The University of Canterbury, Kaspar Middendorf, says they
voted for the strike ballot to be held because “I’m sick
of low pay offers year after year. This year especially,
when my university is making a surplus, yet we have been
presented with one of the lowest pay offers in the
country.”</p>

<p>“Our members are also angry that our
employer is refusing to pay our lowest paid colleagues a
living wage. We want everyone at University of Canterbury to
be paid enough to live on and we don’t know why that would
even be controversial.”</p>

<p>Te Wānanga Aronui O Tamaki
Makau Rau | Auckland University of Technology members are
not negotiating this year, while Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato
| The University of Waikato is currently beginning a fresh
set of negotiations following their recent negotiations
campaign.</p>
