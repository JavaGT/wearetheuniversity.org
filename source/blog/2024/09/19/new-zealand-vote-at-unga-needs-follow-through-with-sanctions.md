<p>It’s pleasing to see New Zealand vote in favour of the
United Nations General Assembly resolution reinforcing the
International Court of Justice finding that Israel’s
occupation in Palestine is illegal.</p>

<p>However, this vote
will only have practical meaning if New Zealand follows
through on the resolution’s requirement that we ban
imports from companies operating in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories.</p>

<p>The UN resolution calls on states to
"take steps towards ceasing the importation of any products
originating in the Israeli settlements, as well as the
provision or transfer of arms, munitions and related
equipment to Israel ... where there are reasonable grounds
to suspect that they may be used in the Occupied Palestinian
Territory."</p>

<p>We also argue that the resolution also
requires the government to suspend Rakon Limited export of
crystal oscillators to the US because these are almost
certainly contained in the US-supplied missiles being used
by Israel to genocidal effect in Gaza.</p>

<p>We have
communicated to the Prime Minister our expectations that
legislation to enact this will be brought before parliament
shortly.</p>
