           <h1>Four Universities To Strike On Thursday</h1>

	 <p>
         </p><p>4,000 Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union
members across four universities will strike for four hours
on Thursday.</p><blockquote><p>TEU members at Waipapa
Taumata Rau | The University of Auckland, Te Kunenga ki
Pūrehuroa | Massey University, Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha
| The University of Canterbury and Te Whare Wānaka o Aoraki
| Lincoln University will take action in response to
inadequate pay offers and employer refusals to ensure all
staff are paid above the Living Wage.</p></blockquote><p>Te
Pou Ahurei Takirua – Ahumahi | Assistant National
Secretary – Industrial, Daniel Benson-Guiu, says the
strikes should come as no surprise to employers. “Pay
growth in the universities has been much slower than the
rest of the Aotearoa workforce, at a time when inflation has
been at 30-year highs. Our members will not take that lying
down. They fought two years ago when 7,000 of our members
took action, they are fighting now and they will keep
fighting until they get the recognition they are
owed.”</p><p>Te Awatea Ward, TEU Branch President at
Massey University, says she is striking because “we
don’t feel heard by our employer. They aren’t
prioritising us – their staff. We want a pay offer that
reflects our importance and the role we play in delivering
education. Without us there is no university.”</p><p>Te
Herenga Waka | Victoria University and Ōtākou Whakaihu
Waka | The University of Otago are not striking at this time
due to ongoing negotiations with university
management.</p>
