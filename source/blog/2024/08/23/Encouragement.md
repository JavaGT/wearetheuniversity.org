Kia ora, Java.

Thank you kindly for the mahi that you and your colleagues undertook with yesterday’s forum. It was great to hear questions asked of what is an underthought, dictatorial and clumsily implemented kaupapa. I thought that the Provost didn’t defend it at all well – although that seems to be her MO with controversial matters: to run interference for Dawn.
