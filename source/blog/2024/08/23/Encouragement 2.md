Kia ora Java,
 
[REDACTED]
 
I’m just writing to say thank you for your hard work on student engagement in this course optimisation process. I attended the event yesterday at the quad, and I think you did a fantastic job with the pointed questions to our Provost. The questions from students in the audience were also outstanding. I thought the attendance was terrific. The provost was clearly on defense, and (sadly) gave us a bunch of half-truths and I reckon some bald faced lies. We staff have grown familiar with the central leadership’s poor leadership, and I’m so glad that students have had some (perhaps) rare exposure to this as well.

Thank you again, and congrats on a successful event.
