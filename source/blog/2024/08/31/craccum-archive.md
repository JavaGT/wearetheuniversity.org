- INTERVIEW WITH THE MEDIA OFFICER - ZAVARA FARQUHAR
Why do you like asking people about their lives so much? Are you trying to live vicariously through them to - fill some kind of void in your own life?
- So at least you don’t pretend that you’re doing law ‘for the community’?
- Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Labour Party?
- Really. Why.
- Shoot, Shag, Marry – Kim Dotcom, Laila Harre, Hone Harawira
- So you’re a racist gold-digger
What’s your stance on the US Presidential Election? Hillary or Bernie? Donald or Ted? Who’s going to win in - November?
- Would you rather have as President of the United States? Donald Trump or Joseph Kony?
- What do you think of the Pokemon I’ve assigned you?
- What has been the most rewarding part of being on the AUSA Executive so far?
- WHY SHOULD I VOTE IN THE AUSA BY-ELECTION?

- Hey there! How are you?
- Yeah I’m from Wellington, so I’m not very good with these places.
- For this year’s Comedy Fest you’re performing “Valley of the LOLS”, is that right?
- So your demographic audience is 24 year old women with anxieties.
- So what have you learnt as a 24 year old woman?
- Any shows you’re especially keen to see?
I just spent the entire morning watching sketches from Funny Girls... How do you come up with an idea for a - sketch?
- So is Funny Girls coming back?
- Have you been watching e Bachelor NZ?
- Do you still keep in contact with Tim, Matt and Connor from U Live?
- Have you had any awkward meetings with famous people?
- I loved the interview with you and Amy Poehler.
- is is your second time coming to New Zealand, right? So what have you learnt about New Zealanders?
- Now what can we expect for your show at this year’s Comedy Fest?
- Your face was used for the Internet Meme ‘Confused Muslim,’ what was that like?
Did you get people coming up to you like “Oh you’re that internet meme” and you were like “Noooo... I’m a - comedian...”
In your stand-up, you talk a lot about your experiences as a British Asian. Do you use stand-up as a - platform to discuss race?
- Following that thread, do you think there is a line between humour and political correctness?
- Do you think being British Asian also influenced the humour you have now?
- And have you got any plans for exploring Auckland?
