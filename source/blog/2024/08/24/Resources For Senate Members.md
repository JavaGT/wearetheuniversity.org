# Management is attempting to make it more difficult than usual for Senate to participate
Please contact everyone you possibly can to make sure they are aware of the [upcoming special meeting of Senate](/2024/08/22/dawn-freshwater-all-staff-email/) on Tuesday 27th August. 

**Management are requiring the senate meeting be in-person only and no proxy voting, this is not the usual senate process, this is a deliberate and blatent tactic to skirt usual accountability**. Vice Chancellor Dawn Freshwater frequently holds online meetings for Senate and Council.

While details continue to be negotiated with organisers for the special meeting, this is further evident of **a fast-track mentality** and with little warning, <mark>**senate members need to be prepared to show in person**</mark>.

## Students
Share this page with other students, as well as teachers, friends, and media. We need to make sure that everyone knows what is happening. Particularly, **members of senate need to know that their in-person attendance is crucial**.

## Members of Senate
Please, for the wellbeing of the university, **attend the meeting**. This is a critical moment for the university and the future of education in New Zealand. **We need you to be there**. **Please encourage your colleagues to attend as well**.
We have compiled a list of resources to support thoughtful discussion and decision-making. Please review the following resources before the meeting:
### [The role of Senate](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/the-university/governance-and-committees/committees/senate.html)
The Senate's **statutory authority derives from the Education Act**, which empowers Council to establish an Academic Board (in the case of this University the Academic Board is called Senate) **to: Advise the Council on matters relating to courses of study** or training, awards, and other academic matters.

### [Student feedback regarding the pedagogical value of small courses (220+ submissions)](https://burn-it.github.io/Disorientation/small-classes/all/)
  - "I love small courses! They offer opportunities to build communities, engage with lecturers, and dive deeper into subject material through interactive class conversations and activities. **I also feel more supported** as a student when I'm in a small course, because **the lecturers care about me**. This motivates me to attend class, put effort in on assignments, and engage more deeply and critically with course material."
  - "They were far and away **my favourite courses**. I **learnt the most**, **connected with my peers and the academic staff**, and felt the most deeply connected to the university. **I would not have stayed** studying here for so long if I hadn't had that connection. These courses were the norm for me in my language classes and my Classics classes beyond stage I courses, and **they are the reason I loved my degree**"

### [Staff feedback regarding transparency, consultation and decision-making processes for the cuts (20+ Submissions)](https://padlet.com/teuuoacm/faculty-course-cutting-gxg4jh0vc4bxjlwu)
  - "As both staff and a student, I haven't been made aware of such changes until it leaked by people who heard third-hand what was going on, and even then **it wasn't what was going on, because the administration hasn't made that clear**"
  - "**I do not feel fully informed** and the student emails we receive are almost a copy/paste of the staff emails with **no real explanation** of the decisions being made"
  - "Instead of coming clean and clarifying and setting the record straight about what's actually happening, faculty **management has chosen to clarify things in meetings behind closed doors** and not allay the (very real) concerns of rank and file students and staff. **the students should NOT have to create a forum to demand answers**"
  - "It's good that the uni (at this stage ...) is saying at least that they hope to protect Maori, Pacific and local content. However, little is known about WHO is making the final decision and on WHAT basis"

### [The Student Charter](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/forms-policies-and-guidelines/student-policies-and-guidelines/student-charter.html)
- This Student Charter sets out the principles underpinning the relationship between you and the University of Auckland, promising to:  
  * "make every endeavour to provide clear, timely and accurate information to you about:  
    * "University policies and procedures;"  
      * Management has not provided any information to students about how restructuring procedures are carried out, what courses will be cut, how many, on what basis.  
      * All information students have found out has been either after faculty were given tight deadlines to make decisions, or after decisions have been made. This is hardly "timely."  
    * "programmes of study, courses, and their assessment requirements;"  
      * Any course changes, regardless of how strongly the Provost insists on us "still \[being\] able to complete \[our\] programmes," will affect our programmes of study. Management has not given us any information about how our programmes will be affected.  
    * "academic, welfare and student experience support services;"   
      * The combination of faculties will have profound impacts on previously-separated support services, the past experience of centralisation of student support services into StudentHubs — where previously an Arts Students Centre existed in the case of the Arts Faculty, a service much more respected than StudentHubs by students’ testimonies — gives us insights into how these might affect us.  
      * Management has not provided students with any information on this by their own accord.  
    * "educational options that meet your needs;"   
      * See above section about pedagogical value of small courses, and programmes of study.  
  * "provide opportunities for you to represent your views, and the views of other students, in a way that emphasises partnership in decision-making by:"  
    * "consulting with students before major decisions affecting students are made;"  
      * The management has not provided any details for the proposed cuts, what we know students have derived themselves with the support of concerned staff.  
      * The Provost vaguely gestures at "student engagement" with the restructuring process, but refuses to answer when asked directly whether students have been consulted.  
      * Justifications of cuts are broad, vague, and inconsistent.  
    * "valuing and responding to student feedback;"  
      * Students have been provided no means to communicate feedback to the management directly about the cuts.  
      * There is no lack of student feedback ([https://burn-it.github.io/Disorientation/small-classes/](https://burn-it.github.io/Disorientation/small-classes/)), but the management refuses to take them into account.  
  * "recognise that it has a duty to support and provide, as best it can, for your health, safety and wellbeing."  
    * The rapidity and uncertainty around management decisions have been anxiety-inducing to say the least. Given the vague and deeply unsatisfactory answers the Provost gave at the forum, the management is evidently uninterested in alleviating this anxiety.  
  * "enable you to make complaints, without being disadvantaged, by ensuring that you:"  
    * "are kept informed about the process, outcome, and reasons for any decision in a timely manner;"  
    * "have the right to be heard;"  
    * "are treated respectfully, fairly and impartially."  
  * "ensure that all staff are aware of and follow the University’s policies and procedures"  
    * It is questionable whether management is aware of the Student Charter
