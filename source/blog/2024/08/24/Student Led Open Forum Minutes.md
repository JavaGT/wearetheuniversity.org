| Prov. Linton acknowledges the concern and worry regarding the ordeal with the course cuts and general future direction of the University of Auckland (UoA). Prov. Linton’s statements of regular UoA practices: Yearly review of evaluation of pre-existing courses and programmes Looking towards 2026: UoA is committed to continue offering a variety of programmes New courses are constantly being added Pre-existing courses are reviewed and cut if necessary–low student numbers, duplicate or too similar to other courses, teaches outdated content, etc. Adjustments and tweaks necessary to “optimise” offerings A joint approach is taken when reviewing curriculum: Interfaculty and intrafaculty review to for course and programme refinement No decisions have been made regarding the concerned course cuts  Prov. Linton assures students and staff these course cuts are part of UoA’s regular practices. This year’s review of courses is not specifically part of the curriculum transformation project |

Following Prov. Linton’s address, the panel engaged in questions and discussions regarding general student and staff concerns.

| Communication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Both staff and student bodies feel there is a lack of clear communication and coordination.  **Staff** There has been a lack of communication with UoA staff. Prov. Linton states: A communication has been put out today (22/08/2024) There has been communication within faculties Focused on delivery communications within/between faculties instead of ‘big broadcast’ **Student Communication** There has been no official communication regarding the course cuts to students as of today (22/08/2024). Information and awareness has been coordinated by students within the student body without official communication. No broadcast message to all students yet Prov. Linton claims there is engagement with a variety of student groups involved in curriculum development in different areas. “Students are involved in conversations..” Student reps, faculty reps, AUSA, university executives “There are lots and lots of places where we talk to and engage with students”                                                                                                                                          |
| **Senate Consultation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Disregarding the fragmented communication between administration, staff and student bodies, communication with the senate has been largely fragmented. Prov. Linton states: senate consultation is part of UoA’s academically lead processes All decisions regarding academic progress pass through senate–includes decisions from any faculty, and all processes leading up to decisions Includes planning, discussions, meetings, proposals, decisions, etc. Regarding course cuts: So far, procedures and discussions have not reached stages in which senate would be involved “Nothing yet to go to senate”  “No different from how we always operate” Special Senate Meeting A special senate meeting will be held 27/08/2024: The meeting has been called regarding the abruptness of the course cuts decisions Meeting has been accepted to offer senate opportunity to ask questions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Concerns have been raised regarding the rushed nature of the proposed course cuts. Prov. Linton states the whole process will be worked on for the next period of time Instead of spending more time on initial consultation, goal is for a more ‘focused approach’ The reason for going fast was to have a “focused look” Prov. Linton:  Regarding the processes; “A bit ambitious with our timeline” “I also acknowledge communications could’ve been better within the university”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Necessity of Course Cuts**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Why reduce course offerings; why make course cuts? Prov. Linton states: New courses are constantly being added; “We actually add new courses all the time” Course numbers need to be balanced Resource limitations restrict number of courses UoA can uphold With constant addition of the new, some of the old needs to be removed “We do add, we do review, we do remove some, that’s what happens” Review of pre-existing and new courses are essential in maintaining relevant programmes–UoA aims to “remain contemporary” Informal Forum Survey Forum attendees present were asked to raise their hand in response to the question:  Have you experienced a negative impact from course cuts in your major? ≈ 85% Have you experienced a positive impact from course additions in your major? ≈15%  **Selection for Which Courses are Cut** Unclear answers on consultation process regarding which courses are selected to be cut Provost not in charge Responsibility is of the respective faculties Intrafaculty discussions are to engage with their students in their own way–there is to be room for student involvement |

| Prov. Linton acknowledges the pedagogical effectiveness of small class sizes.  Smaller classes indeed offer a valuable way of learning Course sizes are not a driving factor in course cuts With the 2026 curriculum transformation: Small classes will continue at UoA in other forms “New ways to be in a small class even if you’re in a big class” New class structures that allow for connected cohorts and building relations  Courses 60 and under A primary concern of students was that courses with student numbers lower than 60 would be in range for potential cuts. According to Prov. Linton: “Nothing special about number 60” Class size is not an overriding factor when considering cuts This process is happening to all faculties, not just arts Student experience with course cuts and additions depends on individual position Arts has been reducing courses but other faculties have been increasing course numbers This matter of class size has been miscommunicated                                                                                                                                     |

| Referring to the new faculty that will combine the faculties of Arts, Education and Social Work and parts of Creative Arts and Industries from 2025; How will courses be affected? Is this transition a reason for course cuts? Prov. Linton: All programmes and courses will remain  Courses will simply move into their respective new faculties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| According to Prov. Linton: “This isn’t about money \[...\] absolutely isn’t about the money” Review of courses and programmes to ensure balance is regular practice Contradictory to Prov. Linton’s statement, science faculty reportedly received news of necessity to cut courses due to financial pressures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| A student questioned the processes that determined whether or not a course should be kept or cut; what defines a course as useful or relevant; are students involved in this decision making? Prov. Linton re-emphasises the UoA’s academic leadership approach: Respective faculties decide which courses are kept Each faculty is responsible for democratic engagement with their students                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| A global studies student stated the impact of course cuts on languages and arts subjects.  UoA has already lost many language courses with many more in scope of being cut Some students in programmes with mandatory language course requirements are unable to complete their programmes Students pay for the courses that the UoA is failing to deliver Prov. Linton: Acknowledges the distress of affected students Languages are a particular area under pressure Faculty of Arts currently working to preserve languages at UoA UoA committed to continue offering languages “Faculties are working really hard” |
