<p>Tomorrow at lunchtime, students and staff at Victoria
University of Wellington will gather in front of the
building where the Vice-Chancellor’s office is located, in
protest of the university’s recently-announced investments
in Israeli government bonds.</p>

<p>In July, the University
Foundation disclosed
to <i>Salient</i>, the university magazine, that it has
almost $50,000 invested in Israeli government bonds. Israeli
bonds finance the apartheid state’s military campaign and
the ongoing genocide in Gaza.</p>

<p>“For months, we’ve
had students and staff writing to the Foundation and the
Vice-Chancellor, demanding that the university divests from
apartheid and genocide. And the university has been
consistently ignoring our voices.” said Nabilah Husna
Abdul Rahman, an organiser from Student Justice for
Palestine Pōneke. “At SJPP, we’ve been using many
tactics to get the University Foundation and the Vice
Chancellor to disclose where they have invested in Israel.
Our requests and meetings have only been met with the
leaders’ denial of responsibility and lack of
accountability to the university
community.”</p>

<p>“Right now, our University leaders do
not seem to care about the International Court of Justice
ruling which declared Israel an apartheid state, and that
universities could be complicit in supporting apartheid
should they fail to review all diplomatic, political, and
economic ties with Israel. But as students and staff, we
should want no part of this.”</p>

<p>“In a week, the Uni
is having its Open Day to recruit new students into an
institution that puts its money in a rogue, genocidal state.
So we have a simple message to those thinking of studying
here. If you’re looking for an educational experience that
isn’t complicit in the devastation of an entire nation,
you may want to reconsider.”</p>

<p>A journal article
published in the medical journal Lancet
has reported that the accumulative effects of the genocide
in Gaza could mean the death toll could reach more than
186,000 people.</p>

<p><i>The rally will be happening Friday,
16 August, 12.30pm at the Hunter Lawn
(Kelburn).</i></p>
