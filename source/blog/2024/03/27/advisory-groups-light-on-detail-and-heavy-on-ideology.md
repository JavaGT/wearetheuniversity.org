           <h1>Advisory Groups Light On Detail And Heavy On Ideology</h1>

             <b>Press Release: <a href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Tertiary_Education_Union">Tertiary Education Union</a></b></span>

         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union says the
government’s announcement
today of two advisory groups to “explore issues facing
the science sector” and “consider the effectiveness of
the current university system” is light on details and
heavy on ideology.</p><p>Te Pou Ahurei | National Secretary
Sandra Grey says “we don’t yet know what the terms of
reference are, who will make up the advisory groups or who
will have input, but we do know that economic performance is
the overwhelming priority.”</p><p>“It’s critical that
any review of higher education must feature staff and
student voices at its heart – there is no science sector
or tertiary education system without us.”</p><p>“We laud
the aims stated the announcement to “achieve better social
outcomes” and “equity for all learners, including
Māori, Pasifika and disadvantaged learners”, but you
can’t do that by viewing education as a business and a
tool to lift economic growth. You have to invest in
education as a public good, which means investing in staff
and students.”</p><p>“If this government is prepared to
do that we will be pleasantly
surprised.”</p>
