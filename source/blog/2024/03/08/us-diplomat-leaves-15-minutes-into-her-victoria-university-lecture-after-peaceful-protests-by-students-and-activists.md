	 <p>
         </p><p>Students and activist groups today protested a planned
lecture by the USA’s Under Secretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security, Dr. Bonnie Jenkins, at
the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW). Dr. Jenkins is
a senior official in charge of AUKUS implementation, a
military alliance currently between Australia, UK and USA. A
number of groups including Justice for Palestine, Student
Justice for Palestine — Pōneke (SJP), Stop AUKUS and
Peace Action Wellington rallied around 150 people, mostly
students, outside the university venue in Pipitea to protest
further collaborations with the USA. This action was
particularly prescient in light of the ongoing US-funded
genocide in Gaza.</p><p>Simultaneously, a peaceful protest
was undertaken inside the lecture hall. An activist began
the lecture by calling for “a moment of silence for all
the Palestinians killed by the US-funded genocide in
Gaza”. He then spoke up about the weapons that the US was
sending to Gaza, before eventually being ejected from the
lecture theatre. Shortly after, another activist stood up
and said “Karetao o te Kāwana kakīwhero!” (“Puppets
of this redneck government.") quoting the women's Super
Rugby Aupiki team Hurricanes Poua’s revamped
haka. “Mai te awa ki te moana (From the river to the
sea), free free Palestine!”</p><p>Dr. Jenkins was ushered
away for the second time, and subsequently a couple of
activists took to speaking and playing an informative video
about how AUKUS represents US imperialism. When organisers
later came in to announce that Dr. Jenkins will not be
continuing with her lecture, chants of “Free, free
Palestine!” filled the room.</p>

<p>“For five months,
Aotearoa has been calling for our government to do more to
stop the genocide in Gaza. And for years, we have been
calling our governments to stand against Israel’s
occupation of Palestine,” says Samira Zaiton, a Justice
for Palestine organiser. “We are now at the juncture of
tightening relations with settler colonies who will only
destroy more lives, more homes and more lands and waters. We
want no part in this. We want no part in
AUKUS.”</p><p>Jenkins’ lecture was organised by Victoria
University’s Centre for Strategic Studies, and claimed to
address “security challenges in the 21st century”.
Valerie Morse, an organiser with Peace Action Wellington,
says: “Experts on foreign policy and regional diplomacy
have done careful research on the disastrous consequences of
involving ourselves with AUKUS. Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa is not a
nuclear testing ground and sacrifice zone for US
wars.”</p><p>Videos
