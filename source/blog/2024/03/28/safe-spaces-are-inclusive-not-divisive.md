	 <p>
         </p><p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union is
appalled by some of the rhetoric coming out of Parliament
related to safe spaces for different cultures and genders in
universities.</p><p>A study space for Māori and Pasifika
students at Waipapa Taumata Rau | The University of Auckland
has sparked inflammatory comments, that were kicked off by a
social media post by ACT MP Dr Parmjeet Parmar.</p><p>But
Tumu Whakarae | National President Dr Julie Douglas says
“what’s divisive is political parties grandstanding and
over simplifying.”</p><p>“Campus spaces where people can
freely express their lived experiences in a safe and
supportive environment with those of a similar world view
contributes to wellbeing and academic
achievement.”</p><p>“Far from being divisive, these
spaces allow students to feel more at home in academic life
in what are Anglocentric colonial
institutions.”</p><p>“Some of the people making
inflammatory comments and bandying around terms like
‘apartheid’ and the ‘KKK’ on this for political gain
might look in the mirror to see the types of accusations
they are
making.”</p>
