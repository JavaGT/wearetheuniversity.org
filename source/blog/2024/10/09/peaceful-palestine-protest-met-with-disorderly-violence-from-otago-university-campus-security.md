<p>Close to 200 protestors marched through the University of
Otago’s Link and to the Clocktower today singing and
chanting in support of a free Palestine. This is the most
recent in a series of peaceful student actions calling on
the university to publicly condemn the genocide in Palestine
and to boycott and divest from Israeli
corporations.</p>

<p>Following speeches at the clocktower, an
Otago Students for Justice in Palestine (OSJP) organiser
gave a rallying cry for students to enter the clocktower and
begin a sit-in, a move carefully planned by OSJP harkening
back to current Vice-Chancellor Grant Robertson’s very own
clocktower occupation in his university days.</p>

<p>The
energy changed quickly when students were met with violence.
Campus Watch and Proctor Dave Scott forcefully held the
protestors back at the door, shouting and pushing them back
through the entrance. A Campus Watch officer grappled a
student who had made it past the front doors and was
standing in the entranceway. In an attempt to wrestle her
backwards, he collided with an interior glass door which
shattered.</p>

<p>“I was appalled to see Campus Watch put
guarding the Clocktower above the safety of our students. We
are a peaceful group, and that was a totally excessive
response,” said an OSJP spokesperson.</p>

<p>Upon seeing
broken glass, OSJP called off the sit-in and the group
retreated to the outside stairs. The rally continued in the
form of a 100-strong chain of people along the
clocktower’s front wall as well as further waiata and
chanting. The morale of the protest remained high despite
the unexpected violence of the university security and the
arrest of one student.</p>

<p>“It is important to remember
why we are here: tens of thousands of people are being
slaughtered in Palestine and our university has done
nothing. We will continue to call on them to endorse the
Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement for a free
Palestine,” said
Schulz.</p>
