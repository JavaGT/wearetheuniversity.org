Today university management decide if they commit to proposed course cuts, or rethink as requested by students, staff, and Senate. Staff are picketing outside this meeting at 3:30pm outside the Clocktower. We join them at 4pm, after the Students for Palestine rally concludes. It is critical we show our support and rally for student choice; this is our best chance to show the University that we will not stand for them cutting our courses!
