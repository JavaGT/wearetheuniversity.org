<p>An alarming decision was made by Victoria University to
host Yael Holan, the Deputy Chief of Mission for the Embassy
of Israel as a guest speaker in an International
Relations course on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>The decision
to host the Israeli Embassy official comes at a time where
Israel is two weeks into a mass bombing campaign across
Lebanon. The guest lecture was originally planned to be held
in-person but was moved online.</p>

<p>Student Justice for
Palestine Pōneke (SJPP) organisers were informed that Holan
relayed several falsehoods during her lecture, including
incorrectly describing Israel’s colonial occupation of
Palestine in the following way: “If we want to parallel it
to New Zealand, Jews are the tangata whenua of the land of
Israel.” This was reported by a Jewish student in the
class, who opposed the statement. The class did not engage
with her during her lecture except to pose critical
questions at the end of her presentation.</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://mc-store1.s3.amazonaws.com/media/nn/beta1-scoop-co-nz/posts/0jEhm4ERAAwiYqJT.jpg"><figcaption><i>(Photo/Supplied)</i></figcaption></figure><p>In
response to this statement, SJPP organiser Leila (Tainui
Waikato) says, “This false equivalence shows how Holan
fails to acknowledge her context within Aotearoa New Zealand
including her responsibilities to te Tiriti o Waitangi. The
actions of the Zionist state of Israel, including armed land
grabs, apartheid laws and ethnic cleansing, are reflective
of a settler-colonial entity. Solidarity for tangata whenua
has always been, will always be, must always be with the
Indigenous and oppressed peoples of the world including
Palestinians, ka whawhai tonu mātou.”</p>

<p>“Our
university has made its own commitments to uphold Te
Tiriti o Waitangi, which means it should not be
platforming a representative of the apartheid Israeli state
– a state that has been committing genocide in Palestine
for a year, and has now expanded its violence through
bombarding Lebanon. Why are we giving space to Israeli
officials to spread what is clearly Zionist propaganda in an
educational environment? A course on “international
security” that does not critically confront the way states
like Israel uses these platforms to normalise its colonial,
expansionist violence is an embarrassing indictment of our
University.”</p>

<p>“This decision confirms the need to
have an institutional boycott, divestment and sanctions
(BDS) policy at VUW. The VUW Foundation Board may have
divested from its Israeli Government Bonds, but the
University’s refusal to stand against genocide and
apartheid couldn’t be clearer,” said Hana
Pilkinton-Ching, another SJPP organiser.</p>

<p>The Israeli
state has killed over 41,000 people in Gaza since October 7
last year. Over 1000 people have been killed as a result of
Israeli strikes in Lebanon in less than two
weeks.</p>
