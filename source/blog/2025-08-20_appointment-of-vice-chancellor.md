**Appointment of Vice-Chancellor**

Following Professor Freshwater’s resignation earlier in the year, University Council will now commence an international recruitment process to appoint our next Vice-Chancellor.

As per Council _Vice-Chancellor Review and Executive Remuneration Committee_ Terms of Reference, the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellor, Chair of Finance Committee and Chair of Audit & Risk Committee, together with academic staff representative Professor Julia Tolmie and professional staff representative Gemma Skipper, will form the Appointment Sub-Committee to lead the recruitment process. The final appointment decision will be made by the full Council.

The Appointment Sub-Committee will be supported by Perrett Laver, an international search firm with impressive experience of Vice-Chancellor appointments, and the University’s Academic Executive Search team.

The Appointment Sub-Committee, Perrett Laver and the UoA Academic Executive Search team will work together to ensure we attract a strong field of candidates, undertake a robust and fair process, and provide all candidates with a positive experience whatever the outcome of their application.

Prior to the commencement of the recruitment, there will be opportunity for staff in each of our Faculties, LSRI’s and Service Divisions, as well as student representatives, to meet with myself, and members of the Appointments Committee.

These meetings will be scheduled over the coming weeks.

In advance of those meetings, I invite all members of the University community to consider the following points, on which we are keen to hear your views:

1. The key strategic opportunities and challenges for our University now and into the future.
2. The attributes, expertise and experience we should be seeking in a new Vice-Chancellor to lead the University.
3. Any potential candidates you suggest the search firm should approach?

The Appointment Sub-Committee have committed to undertaking a confidential process that protects the mana and reputation of candidates, the majority of whom will hold significant leadership positions with their current employer, which we must respect.

Any questions about any aspect of the process should be directed to me, as Chair of the Appointment Committee, and not to any other member of the committee. I will keep staff informed of progress at various milestones.
