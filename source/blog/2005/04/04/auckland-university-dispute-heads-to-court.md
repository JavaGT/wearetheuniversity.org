         Association of University Staff  <br>Media Release<br>4
April 2005</p><p>Auckland University dispute heads to
Court</p><p>The Employment Relations Authority has referred a
dispute between the Association of University Staff (AUS)
and the University of Auckland to the Employment Court after
mediation last week failed to resolve the issues between the
parties.</p><p>The AUS commenced legal action against the
University of Auckland's Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon,
after he refused to meet with unions and other university
employers for preliminary national employment agreement
negotiation discussions. Stuart McCutcheon told the AUS he
will only negotiate single-employer collective agreements at
his University, meanwhile he is giving non-union staff a 4.5
percent salary increase.</p><p>In legal proceedings, the AUS has
alleged that the Vice-Chancellor's refusal to participate in
multi-employer is in breach of the obligations set out in
the Employment Relations Act to:</p><p>*         Use his best
endeavours to enter into an arrangement with the AUS, the
other unions representing university staff and the other six
university employers to set out a process for
bargaining.</p><p>*         Meet with the unions for the
purposes of bargaining.</p><p>*         Consider and respond to
proposals made by the unions.</p><p>*         Be active and
constructive in maintaining a productive employment
relationship with the other university employers.</p><p>The AUS
has also alleged that the Vice-Chancellor has undermined the
bargaining process by:

<p>*         Contravening the
Employment Relations Act by communicating directly with
union members about bargaining.</p><p>*         Placing pressure
on the AUS not to participate in or pursue multi-employer
bargaining.</p><p>*         Undermining the authority of the AUS
in bargaining.</p><p>AUS also says that the Vice-Chancellor is
discriminating against union members by giving non-union
staff a 4.5 percent salary increase, whereas union members
will not receive a salary increase unless they abandon
multi-employer bargaining and participate in single-employer
bargaining.</p><p>The AUS is seeking:</p><p>*         An order
requiring the Vice-Chancellor to participate in the
multi-employer bargaining.</p><p>*         A declaration that
the Vice-Chancellor has acted unlawfully by refusing to
participate in multi-employer bargaining.</p><p>*         A
declaration that the Vice-Chancellor has unlawfully
undermined the bargaining by refusing to bargain, and by
making an offer to increase the salaries of non-union
staff.</p><p>AUS has sought an urgent hearing in the Employment
Court, and is now awaiting a hearing date.</p><p>AUS National
President Professor Nigel Haworth said that the unions had
initiated bargaining earlier in the year for new national
collective employment agreements as part of a campaign to
address inadequate funding and salaries in the university
sector. "Union members have endorsed a 30 percent salary
increase for academic staff and 16 percent plus a national
job evaluation scheme for general (non-academic) staff, all
to be implemented over a three year period," he said. "The
AUS is committed to building a strong alliance across all
parties in the university sector in support of adequate
salary levels."</p><p>The AUS and other university unions
represent around 60 percent of the University's core
staff.</p><p>Ends</p><p></p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
