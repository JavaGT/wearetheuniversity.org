<p><br>$65,000 in student debt for Auckland's doctors, no
wonder they want to leave.</p>

<p>Greg Langton president of the
Auckland University Student's Association (AUSA) expressed
outrage at the size of the total average doctor's student
debt today.</p>

<p>"The total average doctor's debt at graduation
is $65,206 and that is just crippling" Mr Langton
said.</p>

<p>"Its worse for our Maori graduate doctors, they come
out owing $81,250. Also, only 1 in 5 students received a
living allowance for the full 6 years of their MB ChB
study"</p>

<p>"Further, 60% of respondents to a survey by the New
Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA) said they
were forced to work part-time while studying, this obviously
impacts the time medical students can devote to their
considerable study."</p>

<p>"Study pressures, debt and the strain
of having to find money to in order to live places huge
pressures on our medical students, they are having real
problems with the stresses and anecdotally we think it is
resulting in such things as a higher suicide rate."</p>

<p>"The
huge debt burden faced by medical students is also forcing
our future doctors overseas, two thirds of respondents
stated that they would consider leaving New Zealand within
three years of graduating" said Patrick Thomsen-Noa, AUSA's
Education Vice President. "If that's not bad enough when the
country is facing a doctor shortage, those doctors who do
stay may not be raising the next generation, 42% of
respondents said that their debt has influenced their
decision on having children."</p>

<p>"AUSA calls for a decrease
in the cost of medical school fees, an immediately increase
the trainee intern grant and the introduction of a living
allowance for all students to address this problem." Mr
Thomsen-Noa stated.</p>

<p>"65,000 dollars in student debt, no
wonder two thirds of them are thinking about leaving the
country." Mr Langton concluded.
