<p><br>Auckland University ordered to reinstate sacked
lecturer</p>

<p>The University of Auckland has been ordered to
reinstate a permanent lecturer it sacked after refusing to
confirm his appointment at the end of an initial period of
employment. The Employment Relations Authority has also
ordered the University to pay the senior lecturer $10,000
compensation and reimburse all salary lost since his
dismissal in November until his reinstatement takes
effect.</p>

<p>Employment Authority Member James Wilson has also
recommended that the University, in consultation with the
Association of University Staff (AUS), review its
continuation policy to ensure it meets minimum standards of
natural justice, is available to and understood by staff and
to ensure that those charged with administering the policy
are provided with guidance and support regarding their
responsibilities.</p>

<p>The Employment Authority ruled that the
lecturer, who had been engaged on an “on-going”, “tenurable
appointment”, subject to the completion of an initial
four-year term, had been unjustifiably dismissed after being
told by University management he had not met the standards
required of a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland.<p>

<p>AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly said AUS had told the
University that its continuation policy and the process it
was using to dismiss him were unfair and did not meet the
basic standards of natural justice. “Instead of listening
and changing tack, the University continued to use the
policy and, in doing so, caused the AUS member great
distress,” Ms Kelly said. “Because of an unfair policy, he
was powerless to defend himself.”<p>

<p>Helen Kelly said the
University’s disregard for staff and its legal obligations
was not the behaviour expected from a large and
well-resourced public sector institution with a statutory
obligation to be a good employer.”</p>

<p>The AUS will now work
with the University to review its appointment and
continuation processes.</p>
