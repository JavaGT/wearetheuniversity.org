<p>The University of Auckland has been ordered to reinstate a
permanent lecturer it sacked after refusing to confirm his
appointment at the end of an initial period of employment.
The Employment Relations Authority has also ordered the
University to pay the senior lecturer $10,000 compensation
and reimburse all salary lost since his dismissal in
November until his reinstatement takes effect.<br>Employment
Authority Member James Wilson has also recommended that the
University, in consultation with the Association of
University Staff (AUS), review its continuation policy to
ensure it meets minimum standards of natural justice, is
available to and understood by staff and to ensure that
those charged with administering the policy are provided
with guidance and support regarding their
responsibilities.<br>The Employment Authority ruled that the
lecturer, who had been engaged on an “on-going”, “tenurable
appointment”, subject to the completion of an initial
four-year term, had been unjustifiably dismissed after being
told by University management he had not met the standards
required of a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland.
<br>AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly said AUS had told the
University that its continuation policy and the process it
was using to dismiss him were unfair and did not meet the
basic standards of natural justice. “Instead of listening
and changing tack, the University continued to use the
policy and, in doing so, caused the AUS member great
distress,” Ms Kelly said. “Because of an unfair policy, he
was powerless to defend himself.”    <br>Helen Kelly said
the University’s disregard for staff and its legal
obligations was not the behaviour expected from a large and
well-resourced public sector institution with a statutory
obligation to be a good employer.”<br>The AUS will now work
with the University to review its appointment and
continuation processes.<br>The AUS will work with the
University to review its appointment and continuation
processes.<p>
