<p>University attempts to induce staff to leave union<br>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) today accused the
University of Auckland of attempting to induce its members
into leaving the union in a dispute over the bargaining of
new national collective employment agreements for university
staff.</p>

<p>In a move described by AUS General Secretary Helen
Kelly as both outrageous and provocative, the University has
said it would be happy to talk to union members about their
pay if they were to leave the union.</p>

<p>It comes as a dispute
between the AUS and University over bargaining deepens. Last
week, the AUS instigated legal action against the University
after its Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon, refused to
enter bargaining for national collective employment
agreements, and then offered non-union staff a 4.5 percent
salary increase.</p>

<p>In a letter to the AUS, the University’s
Human Resources Manager, Kath Clarke, said that if it
receives any enquiries from staff who may want to leave to
become eligible for the non-union pay increase, it would
first recommend they talk to the union. If, however, the
staff member left the union, they would then be happy to
talk to them about their pay.</p>

<p>Helen Kelly said that the
message from the University is clear; that it would give the
4.5 percent pay increase to anyone who resigned from the
union. “The timing of the pay offer to non-union staff, on
the eve on national negotiations in which the University has
refused to participate, can only be viewed as a deliberate
attempt to undermine the proposed national collective
agreements and the national bargaining itself,” she said.
“Not only have non-union staff been offered a pay increase,
but the University has blatantly denied the right of union
members to bargain in the manner in which they initated.  It
is a serious attack on our organisation and is intended to
weaken the union by inducing members to leave.”<p>
<p>Ms Kelly
said that the duty of good faith, prescribed in the
Employment Relations Act, meant that the parties must not
undermine, or do anything that is likely to undermine, the
bargaining, nor to do anything that would exert undue
influence, either directly or indirectly, on a person with
the intention of inducing a person to leave or not to become
a member of a union. “It is our view that the
Vice-Chancellor of the University of Auckland has set out,
in a calculated fashion, to induce AUS members to leave the
union,” she said. “It is clearly unlawful and made the more
serious by the fact that this is a state sector employer
with a statutory obligation to be a good employer.”</p>

<p>An
application to have this matter referred directly to the
Employment Court is currently being considered by the
Employment Relations Authority.</p>
