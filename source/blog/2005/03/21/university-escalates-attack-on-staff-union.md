         University escalates attack on staff union<br>The University
of Auckland has stepped up its attack on the Association of
University Staff (AUS), this time by attempting to prevent
the union from going about its day-to-day business on
campus. The University has implied that it will cut off
access to the University’s email system after the AUS wrote
to non-union staff at the University encouraging them to
join the union.</p><p>The AUS has brought legal action against
the University after its Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon,
refused to enter bargaining for national collective
employment agreements, and offered non-union staff a 4.5
percent salary increase.</p><p>Following a letter from AUS to
non-union staff, the University’s head of Human Resources,
Kath Clarke, wrote saying that the emailed letter was in
breach of the AUS’s duty of good faith towards the
University. “We also note that providing access to the
University email system is a privilege that has been
extended to the AUS to enable you to communicate with your
members,” wrote Ms Clarke. “We are thereby writing to seek
your undertaking that the AUS will ensure that any further
communications issued by it, comply with its duty of good
faith. If the AUS continues to act in breach of its duty of
good faith, we confirm that this will be treated very
seriously by the University.”</p><p>AUS General Secretary Helen
Kelly said the University’s letter clearly threatened that
email access would be stopped if the union again wrote to
non-union staff at the University. She said it was
extraordinary that the University would attempt to restrict
freedom of speech and association, particularly given the
statutory responsibilities universities have to academic
freedom.

<p>“This is unacceptable and intimidatory behaviour
from the University towards its staff and the AUS” said Ms
Kelly. “We have a lawful right to encourage non-union staff
to join the union, and the use of email or of visiting them
at their worksite are perfectly acceptable ways of
communicating this. Right of access to workplaces is a
statutory right for unions provided in the Employment
Relations Act, and it is also supported by the International
Labour Organisation’s declarations on the freedom of
association and the effective recognition of unions.”</p><p>“AUS
will not be intimidated by threats from the University of
Auckland, and we will continue to exercise our lawful right
to communicate with union and non-union staff in any manner
we believe appropriate,” Ms Kelly said.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further
