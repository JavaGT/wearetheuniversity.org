         Staff protest rally at University of Auckland</p><p>A protest
rally will be held outside the University of Auckland
Registry, Princess St., Auckland between 12 noon and 2.00 pm
on Tuesday 15 March 2005.</p><p>This relates to the actions of
the University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart
McCutcheon who has refused to enter bargaining for national
collective employment agreements for university staff and,
in a move which is seen by the Association of University
Staff as an attack on the unions, has offered non-union
staff at the University a salary increase of 4.5
percent.</p><p>The media release below, sent out Friday,
contains further details.</p><p><b> Auckland attempts to scuttle
national university wage bargaining</b></p><p>Staff members at
the University of Auckland are furious at their
Vice-Chancellor's attempts to scuttle national collective
bargaining by offering non-union staff a 4.5 percent salary
increase on the eve of union negotiations. The
Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon, has also refused to
enter national bargaining negotiations with the university
unions, saying that he will only negotiate an Auckland
University agreement. </p><p>Non-union staff members at the
University of Auckland were today offered the 4.5 percent
pay rise, effective from 1 May 2005, without any negotiation
and without notice to the unions. Those staff will be given
the pay rise unless they specifically inform the University
they do not wish to receive it. </p><p>Speaking on behalf of the
combined university unions, the Association of University
Staff (AUS) National President, Professor Nigel Haworth,
said that the refusal of University of Auckland to enter
national multi-employer bargaining compromised the sector's
collective ability to resolve the long-standing underfunding
of New Zealand universities and the consequent inadequate
salary levels.

<p>“The union views the offer to non-union
staff as a clearly calculated attempt by Stuart McCutcheon
to undermine the proposed national bargaining with unions,”
said Professor Haworth. “It is a direct attack on the choice
of that University's staff to belong to and bargain through
a union, and is exceptionally poor employment practice. It
is also a clear breach of good faith.” </p><p>Professor Haworth
said that the Vice-Chancellor's action was more questionable
given that he had not indicated his intentions in an open
and frank discussion about bargaining with AUS officials
earlier in the week. “For a State Sector employer, who is
also Chair of the New Zealand Vice Chancellors Committee,
this is an extraordinary way to respond to his
responsibilities,” he said. “His actions are in direct
contravention to the Government's expectations and
intentions in terms of building good employment
relationships and collective bargaining.” </p><p>Professor
Haworth also warned that the actions of the Vice-Chancellor
were destined to lead to industrial unrest at Auckland .
“The Government has acknowledged that universities have
missed out on their share of public funding, and that
salaries have suffered as a result. We will not stand back
and let Stuart McCutcheon undermine the collective sectoral
approach to resolving funding and salary problems,” he said
</p><p>National discussions between university employers and
unions are scheduled to get underway on 15 March.
