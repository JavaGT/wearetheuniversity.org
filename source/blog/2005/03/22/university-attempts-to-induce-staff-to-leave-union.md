	 <p>
         21 March 2005</p><p>University attempts to induce staff to leave
union</p><p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) today
accused the University of Auckland of attempting to induce
its members into leaving the union in a dispute over the
bargaining of new national collective employment agreements
for university staff.</p><p>In a move described by AUS General
Secretary Helen Kelly as both outrageous and provocative,
the University has said it would be happy to talk to union
members about their pay if they were to leave the
union.</p><p>It comes as a dispute between the AUS and
University over bargaining deepens. Last week, the AUS
instigated legal action against the University after its
Vice-Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon, refused to enter
bargaining for national collective employment agreements,
and then offered non-union staff a 4.5 percent salary
increase.</p><p>In a letter to the AUS, the University’s Human
Resources Manager, Kath Clarke, said that if it receives any
enquiries from staff who may want to leave to become
eligible for the non-union pay increase, it would first
recommend they talk to the union. If, however, the staff
member left the union, they would then be happy to talk to
them about their pay.</p><p>Helen Kelly said that the message
from the University is clear; that it would give the 4.5
percent pay increase to anyone who resigned from the union.
“The timing of the pay offer to non-union staff, on the eve
on national negotiations in which the University has refused
to participate, can only be viewed as a deliberate attempt
to undermine the proposed national collective agreements and
the national bargaining itself,” she said.

<p>“Not only have
non-union staff been offered a pay increase, but the
University has blatantly denied the right of union members
to bargain in the manner in which they initiated.  It is a
serious attack on our organisation and is intended to weaken
the union by inducing members to leave.” </p><p>Ms Kelly said
that the duty of good faith, prescribed in the Employment
Relations Act, meant that the parties must not undermine, or
do anything that is likely to undermine, the bargaining, nor
to do anything that would exert undue influence, either
directly or indirectly, on a person with the intention of
inducing a person to leave or not to become a member of a
union. </p><p>“It is our view that the Vice-Chancellor of the
University of Auckland has set out, in a calculated fashion,
to induce AUS members to leave the union,” she said. “It is
clearly unlawful and made the more serious by the fact that
this is a state sector employer with a statutory obligation
to be a good employer.”</p><p>An application to have this matter
referred directly to the Employment Court is currently being
considered by the Employment Relations Authority.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
