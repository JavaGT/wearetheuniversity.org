	 <p>
         Thursday 3rd of March </p><p>University of Auckland practically
“burning” Cash</p><p>The University of Auckland is under-fire
from students for its ”exorbitant” spend on Advertising
according to figures recently obtained by the New Zealand
University Students Association “The University spent over
$2million dollars on an aggressive marketing campaign that
appears to have had little or no effect on the choices that
students made in choosing their institution of study”” Said
Patrick Thomsen-Noa Education Vice President of the Auckland
University Students Association</p><p>“That 2 million dollars
would be better spent on improving support services for
current students as opposed to attracting more to an already
overcrowded university” Said Thomsen-Noa</p><p>“Sky rocketing
enrolments in the University have placed a strain on the
resources available for students. Burgeoning class sizes and
congested walkways are creating a potentially hazardous
environment.” Said Conor Roberts Administration
Vice-President of the Auckland University Students
Association</p><p>”The University of Auckland happily spent over
half a million dollars in radio advertising and over
$700,000 on newspaper advertisements while pleading poverty
to students as fees were increased by on average of 4.1%The
University are practically burning cash “ said
Roberts</p><p>“This University has hit maximum capacity with a
roll of nearly 35,000. Even the University has admitted this
is an issue and yet they spent the most of any university in
New Zealand last year on advertising and marketing” Said
Thomsen-Noa</p><p>ENDS </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>
