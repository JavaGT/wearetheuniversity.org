<p>12 July 2005</p>

<p>Vice-chancellors have opportunity to resolve
pay dispute say staff unions</p>

<p>University vice-chancellors
have been urged by unions to show leadership in an effort to
avoid strike action planned by staff during the fortnight
between 20 July and 4 August.</p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the
combined university staff unions, Professor Nigel Haworth
said that the Government's establishment of a University
Salaries Group (USG) provided both a welcome and ideal
opportunity for the parties to work in a tripartite process
to consider and resolve the salary issues facing the sector,
rather than becoming embroiled in an industrial
confrontation.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that, in response to
the establishment of the USG, the vice-chancellors had
indicated their intention to try to have the group's terms
of reference broadened to funding-in-general, including for
infrastructure and other facilities. "In other words, they
are willing to squander the first real chance to get real
engagement with government on salary issues, despite their
consistent assertion that realistic salary levels are not
affordable at current funding levels," said Professor
Haworth.  "As a result, we are concerned that
vice-chancellors stand to undermine the first opportunity in
fifteen years to find real solutions to the most serious
problem facing the sector, that of paying competitive
salaries and ensuring the recruitment and retention of
high-quality staff."</p>

<p>"From the Minister's perspective,
this must be disturbing, if only because the
vice-chancellors' position is so clearly at odds with
government's industrial relations and tertiary education
policies," said Professor Haworth. "Staff and students will
look askance at this because, for most, their world is not
the competitive one promoted by the vice-chancellors."<p>
<p>Professor Haworth said that vice-chancellors had become
isolated from the mainstream of thinking about the
university sector in New Zealand, and their participation in
the USG would provide an opportunity for them to reassert a
position as innovative leaders in the sector.</p>

<p>The
university unions today completed a round of meetings at
seven universities which reaffirmed a decision to take
sustained strike action in protect at the vice-chancellors
refusal to agree to national collective employment
agreements for staff and inadequate salary offers of between
2 and 4.5 percent.</p>

<p>The Government's University Salaries
Group will hold its first meeting tomorrow (13 July) to
discuss its membership and terms of
reference.</p>
