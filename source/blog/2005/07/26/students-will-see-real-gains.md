	 <p>
         The Association of University Staff (AUS) has applauded the
announcement today that Labour will end all interest on
student loans for students residing within New Zealand, and
increase the eligibility for student allowances from next
year.</p><p>AUS National President Professor Nigel Haworth said
that the announcement represents the most significant move
in ensuring that university education is affordable since
the introduction of the current student fees and loan
schemes in 1991.</p><p>Professor Haworth said that university
staff had consistently expressed concerns about the effect
of high student loans and debt on students’ access to
university education, and on students’ learning experience.
</p><p>“The evidence suggests some potential students are
deterred from university study by the cost of their
education. Others have their educational progress
compromised by having to work at the same time as they
study,” Professor Haworth said. “Today’s policy announcement
will have a considerable impact as it will allow students to
concentrate on study without worrying about escalating debt
caused by the accrual of interest. It will also be of real
benefit to people temporarily out of the workforce, such as
those looking after children, who also currently accrue
interest on their outstanding loans.” </p><p>Professor Haworth
said that targeted measures, such as the cutting of interest
on student loans to graduates remaining in New Zealand and
making allowances more accessible, were preferable to tax
cuts as a means to ensure the high educational standards
needed for a knowledge-based society.</p><p>Ends</p><p>For further
