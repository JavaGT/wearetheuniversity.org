<p>Students will see real gains with Labour’s tertiary
education policy</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS)
has applauded the announcement today that Labour will end
all interest on student loans for students residing within
New Zealand, and increase the eligibility for student
allowances from next year.</p>

<p>AUS National President
Professor Nigel Haworth said that the announcement
represents the most significant move in ensuring that
university education is affordable since the introduction of
the current student fees and loan schemes in
1991.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that university staff had
consistently expressed concerns about the effect of high
student loans and debt on students’ access to university
education, and on students’ learning experience.<p>

<p>“The
evidence suggests some potential students are deterred from
university study by the cost of their education. Others have
their educational progress compromised by having to work at
the same time as they study,” Professor Haworth said.
“Today’s policy announcement will have a considerable impact
as it will allow students to concentrate on study without
worrying about escalating debt caused by the accrual of
interest. It will also be of real benefit to people
temporarily out of the workforce, such as those looking
after children, who also currently accrue interest on their
outstanding loans.”<p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that targeted
measures, such as the cutting of interest on student loans
to graduates remaining in New Zealand and making allowances
more accessible, were preferable to tax cuts as a means to
ensure the high educational standards needed for a
knowledge-based
society</p>
