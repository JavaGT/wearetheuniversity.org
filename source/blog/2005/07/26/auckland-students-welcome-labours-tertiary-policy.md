<p>Auckland Students welcome Labour’s Tertiary
Policy</p>

<p>University of Auckland students today applauded the
announcement of Labour’s tertiary education policy,
commenting that it would go a long way in working towards
reducing the drivers of the $7billion nationwide student
debt.</p>

<p>“We applaud Labour for taking action on the issues
of student debt”, said Auckland University Students
Association President Greg Langton. “This is a major step in
finally addressing what can only be described as a
generational crisis, and we certainly hope that it signals a
longer term commitment by the party in this area”, he
said.</p>

<p>“Obviously we are disappointed that there was no
change to the Fee Maxima system, which is a bit of a joke
given the fee increase exemptions that the Tertiary
Education Commission are only too keen to give out”, said Mr
Langton. “But we certainly do think that this is a
significant development, and we would be very keen to see it
implemented, to the benefit of students, graduates and their
families”, he added.<p>

<p>AUSA Education Vice President Xavier
Goldie added that students had been campaigning long and
hard to make the Government listen to them about the
societal impacts of debt. “We’ve made it clear that student
debt is preventing graduates from buying a home and starting
a family”, he said. “It’s good to see that Labour are
joining the ranks of the Greens, United Future and New
Zealand first in recognising that it’s about time for the
Government to step up to the plate and make a real change in
this
area”</p>
