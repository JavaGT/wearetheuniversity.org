<p>Where’s the rest, Don?</p>

<p>University of Auckland students are
demanding that Don Brash and the National Party come clean
with their full Tertiary Education Policy to ensure that
students are fully informed before they head to the polls on
Election Day. The call comes in response to the release of a
tax relief policy on student loans by the National Party
today.</p>

<p>“It’s great that National have finally released at
least part of their intentions for the tertiary sector”,
said Auckland University Students Association President Greg
Langton. “We are concerned, however, that National are not
telling the full story when it comes to the costs that
students will have to pay” he said.</p>

<p>Mr Langton added that
it was very difficult for students to take the promises
seriously, when it was National that introduced the Student
Loan Scheme in their last administration, a scheme that
amounted to over $7 billion worth of debt between 460 000
New Zealanders. “We would certainly welcome a change in
policy direction from the National Party. We just don’t know
if this announcement necessarily constitutes that”.<p>

<p>AUSA
Education Vice President Xavier Goldie added that the tax
relief may be totally meaningless for students within the
context of further changes to the tertiary education sector
that National supported.<p>

<p>“We don’t know what National
will do with interest rates on loans, but we do know that
they are in favour of removing the cap on tuition fee
increases”, he said. “It’s patently clear that if those
changes go ahead under a National-led government, then any
tax relief on student loan repayments will mean very little
in real terms. The end result will simply be students
borrowing more from the scheme to pay for the rapidly rising
cost of tertiary education.<p>

<p>“We call on all parties to
take a serious look at the issue of student debt, which
affects more New Zealanders than just the students
themselves. It’s high time that there were real changes to
the system, rather than simply pre-election sweeteners”,
said Mr
Langton.</p>
