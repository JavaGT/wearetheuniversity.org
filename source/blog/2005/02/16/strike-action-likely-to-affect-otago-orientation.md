<p>Strike action likely to affect Otago student orientation
activities</p>

<p>Staff at the Otago University Students'
Association (OUSA) are to embark on industrial action
following the breakdown of collective employment agreement
negotiations with their student employers.</p>

<p>OUSA is
currently offering staff a 3.5% pay increase for the 2
years, from January 2004 to January 2006, with a further
cost of living increase from January 2006. The Association
of University Staff (AUS), which represents staff members,
says the offer fails to adequately compensate for increases
in the cost of living over the period, let alone recognise
the significantly increased workloads faced by staff.</p>

<p>The
AUS is claiming a 3.5% pay increase from January 2004, with
a further 3.2% from January 2005.</p>

<p>"OUSA staff are being
asked to accept another two years of sub-inflation pay
increases, after already having received an increase in 2003
which was lower than the rate of inflation," said Mr Scott.
"Adding insult to injury is that the inadequate pay offer
comes at a time when staff members' workloads have grown in
tandem with burgeoning student enrolments at the
University."</p>

<p>Mr Scott said union members noted that while
OUSA has been calling on the Government to ensure that
student allowances keep pace with the rising cost of living,
it was not prepared to apply the same principle to its own
staff.</p>

<p>Mr Scott said that many OUSA staff themselves are
repaying student loans, as well as facing increasing
mortgages, childcare, and other living expenses.<p>
<p>AUS
members believe that if OUSA is genuinely concerned about
the rising cost of living and the effects of the student
loan scheme, it would set an example by treating its own
employees fairly. "They should practice what they preach,"
said Mr Scott.</p>

<p>The parties attended mediation last
Thursday in an attempt to avert strike action during
Orientation, the Association's busiest time of the year. Mr
Scott said while some mediation discussions had been
positive, not enough had changed to avert the planned
industrial action by union members. Provision of OUSA
services for Summer School students may also be
affected.</p>

<p>A programme of industrial action, including
strike action, begins next week.</p>
