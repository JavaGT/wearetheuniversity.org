	 <p>
         <br>Government called on to ditch private savings proposal
for tertiary Education</p><p>The Association of University Staff
(AUS) today called on the Government not to promote any
moves to encourage private savings for tertiary education
after the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, announced that
''intense policy work'' was underway to help people save for
their children's tertiary education. It is expected that the
Government will propose the funding of private insurance
schemes or individualised savings accounts for tertiary
study following statements by the Prime Minister about
housing, pension and education savings schemes.</p><p>AUS
General Secretary Helen Kelly said a private savings scheme,
to fund individuals into tertiary education, would further
erode the idea that education is a public good, and would
strengthen the notion that tertiary education is a private
benefit which should be increasingly funded through
individual contribution.</p><p>Ms Kelly said AUS was committed
to a publicly-funded, high-quality education system which
provided equal access to all people, and not just those who
could afford to pay. "A private savings scheme is highly
regressive," she said, "and would not only favour those who
can afford to save, but also would discriminate against
low-income families and groups such as women who take time
out from paid employment to meet family
responsibilities."</p><p>'The introduction of individualised
savings or insurance schemes to fund tertiary education
would expose New Zealand to the risk of developing a
two-tier tertiary education system: one for those who are
able to save privately and another, inferior one, for those
dependent on an under funded public system," said Ms
Kelly.</p><p>Ms Kelly also said that an individual savings
scheme could well be used as a means of disguising the
effects of the controversial student loan scheme, but
without reducing the burden on individuals of paying for
their tertiary education. "Adequate funding is a state
responsibility", she said, "and Government's priority should
be to properly fund tertiary education."</p><p>Ends
