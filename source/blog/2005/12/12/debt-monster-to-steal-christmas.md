         Media Statement                     12 December 2005        
For Immediate Release</p><p>Debt Monster to Steal
Christmas</p><p>University of Auckland students expecting a
stress-free Christmas have had their hopes dashed by an
expected late appearance of the dreaded Debt Monster today,
when the University of Auckland Council debates whether to
raise both Undergraduate and Post-Graduate Fees for
2006.</p><p>The Debt Monster will be making an appearance at
3.00pm to steal the presents under the Christmas Tree at the
University of Auckland Clock Tower, before the Council
meeting begins at 3.45pm. It is likely that the Monster’s
presence at the Tree will no doubt result in tension between
himself and Santa Claus, who will be there to place presents
under the tree.</p><p>Auckland University Students Association
(AUSA) President Greg Langton said that the appearance of
both Santa Claus and the Debt Monster, giving and taking
away simultaneously, signified the absurd approach to the
Tertiary Sector by the Government. “On one hand we have the
Government offering Students interest free loans, and on the
other, an absolute refusal by Government to meet the real
costs of providing quality education”, he said. “The end
result is the University of Auckland Council being forced to
increase fees, resulting in higher loans for students
anyway”.</p><p>Mr Langton said the zero-interest policy, while a
welcome relief to the 400,000 New Zealanders with a student
loan, would be a dead duck if the Government didn’t follow
up with other funding changes in the Sector. “While students
may welcome zero interest on their loans, if the Government
doesn’t make any real changes to the way that Tertiary
institutions are funded, it is inevitable that institutions
will raise fees wherever they can, which simply wasn’t the
point, or the intended outcome of the policy”, he
said.

<p>Although acknowledging the Council’s unenviable
position, AUSA Education Vice President Xavier Goldie
expressed disappointment that the Council had left the fee
setting process so late. “Students have already enrolled in
many of the classes and papers that will have their fees
increased on Monday”, he said “It’s poor form to be
increasing these costs after the fact, without letting
students have the opportunity to consider the fees before
enrolling in the papers”.</p><p>AUSA calls on the Government and
new Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen to make real
progress on the issue of long-term tertiary funding, to
ensure that Universities are able to meet rising costs of
providing quality degrees without continually raising
student
fees.</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
