<p>The following media release is forwarded by the Association
of University Staff, an affiliate union of Education
International. This release raises, on the international
stage, includes concerns about the New Zealand Government’s
support for a “Friends of Private Education Exports” lobby
set up to protect and advance the interests of New Zealand’s
private-education exporters in the World Trade Organisation
(WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (or GATS)
negotiations.</p>

<p><br>6th World Trade Organisation Ministerial
Conference</p>

<p>“Take education out of GATS”, teachers
urge</p>

<p>In a statement released today to delegations to the
6th WTO Ministerial Conference, Educational International
(EI), the global union representing more than 29 million
teachers and education workers is calling on member
countries to remove education services from the General
Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).</p>

<p>“Because there are
so many unanswered questions about the impact of GATS on
education, and because there is so much at stake, we believe
all members must adopt a precautionary approach. They must
neither make nor seek any commitments that constrain the
rights of government to regulate education as they see fit,
including research, audio-visual services, and libraries,"
stated Thulas Nxesi, EI President.</p>

<p>The statement, adopted
by participants to EI's higher-education and research
meeting, held last week in Melbourne, Australia, also
recommends that countries make no commitments on private
education services.<p>
<p>“As the boundary between public and
private education becomes increasingly blurred in many
countries, the danger is that commitments taken in private
education could easily expose the public system,” explained
Nxesi.</p>

<p>EI is also concerned about proposals for compulsory
benchmarking and plurilateral approaches to the services
negotiations. According to Nxesi, such changes would put
undue pressure on developing countries and coerce them into
making more extensive commitments in sensitive areas like
education and other public services.</p>

<p>In addition, Thulas
Nxesi says teachers are deeply disturbed by the recent New
Zealand-led establishment of a “friends of education
exports” group that is specifically targeting education
services.</p>

<p>“We believe strongly that, at its root, GATS is
in conflict with educational values. The GATS is a
commercial agreement designed to expand business
opportunities for investors. Education, by contrast, is a
human right that serves the public interest and must not be
treated as a commodity subject to commercial trade rules,”
said Nxesi.</p>
