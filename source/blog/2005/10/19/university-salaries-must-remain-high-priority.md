<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Release<br> 19
October 2005</p>

<p>University salaries must remain high
priority</p>

<p>University salaries and funding must remain a top
priority for the incoming Associate Minister of Education
(Tertiary Education), according to the Association of
University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>Welcoming the incoming
Minister, Dr Michael Cullen, into his new tertiary education
role, AUS National President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said
that such a high-level appointment was clear evidence that
the Government recognises the strategic importance of the
university sector, and is committed to resolving
long-standing funding and salary problems.<p>

<p>A former
Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education) is the
new Minister of Education.</p>

<p>“These appointments shows
that the Government as a whole, and not just individual
ministers, appreciate the extent of the problems facing the
university sector, and that Government is committed to
finding constructive solutions through working with the
unions and vice-chancellors,” said Professor Haworth.</p>

<p>“The Labour Party gave a commitment to continuing the
University’s Tripartite Forum in its tertiary education
manifesto for the recent General Election, and Dr Cullen’s
appointment, supported by that of Mr Maharey, will give
university staff the confidence that the Government is
serious about its manifesto commitment,” said Professor
Haworth. “It also shows that the industrial campaign mounted
by university staff over last two years will deliver
political solutions to funding and salary problems.”<p>
<p>Professor Haworth said that the incoming Ministers'
backgrounds in both finance and tertiary education makes him
ideally suited to continuing the tripartite process. This
will ensure that university staff are paid “fair and
appropriate” salaries, sufficient to recruit and retain
suitable staff, strengthen employee commitment to the
delivery of quality tertiary education research and
teaching, and enable universities to build on the existing
reputation and skill base.<p>

<p>The University
Tripartite Forum is expected to meet again later this month
with the expectation that its initial work will inform
funding decisions for the university sector in the next
Budget.</p>
