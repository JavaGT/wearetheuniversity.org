<p>University staff union concerned at Otago
fee rise</p>

<p>The Otago Branch of the Association of University
Staff (AUS) expressed concern today at the 5 percent fee
increases facing Otago University students next
year.</p>

<p>Branch President Shane Montague-Gallagher said it
appears that the University was in a no-win situation with
fee increases. "With rising costs for the University
exceeding any increases in government funding, it seems the
Council had little choice but to raise fees in this
instance."</p>

<p>"A significant reduction in income in real
terms for the University could compromise standards", said
Mr Montague-Gallagher. "There are serious issues confronting
the University in terms infrastructure, and salaries are
still at a level where it can be difficult to attract new
staff."</p>

<p>"Through years of inadequate salary increases and
increasing student fees, both staff and students have borne
the brunt of under-funding for too long," said Mr
Montague-Gallagher.</p>

<p>"We hope the University Tripartite
Forum, established as a result of the recent industrial
unrest on most university campuses, and which involves
unions, vice-chancellors and government representatives,
will come up with some real solutions that will serve the
sector long-term, said Mr Montague-Gallagher.</p>
