<p>Smart Strikes to Disrupt University of
Canterbury</p>

<p>Industrial conflict at the University of
Canterbury escalated today with members of the Association
of University Staff (AUS) agreeing on a raft of new measures
to advance their claim for the crisis in university salaries
to be addressed.</p>

<p>A new approach, dubbed a “smart strike”
by the AUS, the campaign will cause significant disruption
to the final week of the third term.</p>

<p>The actions
include:</p>

<p>- Staff will not teach for up to 8 hours in the
coming week, striking a lecture at a time.</p>

<p>- Staff will
not submit end-of-year exam papers that are normally
collated at this time.</p>

<p>- Staff will not submit students’
final grades to Registry.</p>

<p>- Staff will withdraw from
participation in the current PBRF round.</p>

<p>- Staff will not
implement Catalyst, the new student services software
package.</p>

<p>- Staff will withdraw their co-operation with
academic committees and ignore compliance requests from
management.</p>

<p>- Staff will work to rule, go slow, and refuse
any overtime work.</p>

<p>- Staff will clog communication
networks of the Vice-Chancellor and senior management.</p>

<p>AUS
members have each lost two days pay in strikes to date, and
have been denied a pay increase that non-union members have
been receiving.<p>

<p>AUS Canterbury Branch President, David
Small, said that this anti-union tactic is serving to
increase the resolve of staff at the university, the
majority of whom are union members.</p>

<p>Dr Small accused the
Vice-Chancellor, Roy Sharp, of maintaining an irresponsible
silence in the current dispute.  “Roy Sharp is at the helm
of a public institution that is an important asset to the
people of Canterbury”, he said. “The people of this region
are entitled to know why he is driving it onto the rocks by
pushing university staff to unprecedented levels of
alienation”.</p>
