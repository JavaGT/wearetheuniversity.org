<p>Ban on student marks withdrawn</p>

<p>The
threatened withholding of students' grades by university
staff has been withdrawn while collective employment
agreement negotiations continue between university unions
and the country's university management.<p>

<p>Last week,
university staff voted  to withhold marks and take strike
action over a two-week period from 20 July unless
satisfactory progress was made in negotiations this
week.</p>

<p>University staff are proposing new national
collective employment agreements for academic and general
staff, and are seeking a major salary boost to address what
have been acknowledged by the Government and university
employers to be inadequate salary levels in the sector.
Industrial action was threatened after employers made salary
offers of between 2 percent and 4.5 percent on the basis of
single-employer employment agreements.</p>

<p>The negotiations,
which resumed in Christchurch this week with the assistance
of an industrial mediator, will continue on 20 and 21
June.</p>

<p>The combined unions' spokesperson, Jeff Rowe, said
that the progress made in negotiation over the past two days
had been sufficient to withdraw the threat of withholding of
marks. He said, however, that proposed strike action may
proceed if the negotiations do not reach a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr Rowe said he was unable to reveal details
of the progress made in negotiations at this
stage.</p>
