<p>Universities salary group to be
established</p>

<p>The Minister of Education, Trevor Mallard, has
given the green light to a proposal to establish a
university salaries group to consider and resolve issues
around salaries in the university sector. The group would
comprise the Minister (or representatives), vice-chancellors
and union representatives.</p>

<p>The Minister has directed
officials to set up, as soon as possible, a University
Tripartite Forum to focus on high-level strategic salary
issues, and provide information to inform future budget and
bargaining strategies.<p>

<p>In establishing the group, the
Minister was responding to a proposal from the university
unions to develop a tripartite mechanism to ensure that
university staff are paid "fair and appropriate" salaries,
sufficient to recruit and retain suitable staff, strengthen
employee commitment to the delivery of quality tertiary
education research and teaching, and enable universities to
build on the existing reputation and skill base.<p>

<p>Combined
unions' spokesperson, Professor Nigel Haworth said that this
was a significant development and would provide the basis
for a constructive approach for all parties to determine
salary levels which would allow New Zealand universities to
maintain pace with the international market.</p>

<p>"This move
will be welcomed by university staff as it will allow a
constructive and cooperative approach to the resolving
salary problems in a manner we have been seeking for a
number of years.</p>

<p>The proposal from the unions and the
Minister's response can be found on the AUS
