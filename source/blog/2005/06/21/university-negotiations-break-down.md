<p>University negotiations break down</p>

<p>Negotiations for new
national collective employment agreements between university
unions and vice-chancellors have broken down. Universities
will now, for the first time ever, face prolonged national
strike action.</p>

<p>The negotiations, which resumed in
Christchurch today, broke down after all of the university
employers maintained their previous refusal to agree to
national collective agreements, insisting on single-employer
agreements with salary increases ranging from 2.0 percent
(Massey) to 4.5 percent (Auckland). Some of the universities
have also now initiated single-employer
bargaining.</p>

<p>Combined university unions’ spokesperson, Jeff
Rowe, said that the unions had hoped that vice-chancellors
would respond positively to an offer by the Government, made
last week, to establish a Universities Salaries Group to
investigate and resolve long-recognised salary problems in
the sector. “The unions had proposed an interim settlement
to these negotiations which would have facilitated the
opportunity for the parties to find long-term solutions to
the salary issues faced by universities,” he said. “The
employers’ rejection of our position, and their luke-warm
support of the Government’s proposal lead us to question
their commitment to resolving these issues at
all.”</p>

<p>Association of University Staff General Secretary,
Helen Kelly, called on university councils to now step into
the dispute, saying it was an important governance matter.
“That the vice-chancellors are jeopardising a significant
opportunity to work constructively with the Government and
unions to find solutions should be of major concern to
councils,” she said. “Even if vice-chancellors are prepared
to risk the long-term quality and reputation of  New Zealand
universities, their councils should not.</p>

<p>The unions will
hold meetings over the next week to consider escalating
industrial action, already proposed to start on 20
July.</p>

<p>Ends<p>
