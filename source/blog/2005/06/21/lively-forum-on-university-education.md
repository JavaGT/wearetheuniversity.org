<p>Forum on University Education</p>

<p>Wednesday 22 June -
12.10pm</p>

<p>Hunter Lecture Theatre 323</p>

<p>Victoria University,
Wellington</p>

<p>Speakers will include the Minister of
Education, Hon Trevor Mallard (Labour), Bill English
(National), Nandor Tanczos (Green), Craig McNair (NZ First)
and Stephen Franks (ACT)</p>

<p>The forum will be introduced by
Helen Kelly, General Secretary of the Association of
University Staff who will outline the critical situation
facing university staff following the breakdown of national
collective employment agreement negotiations today.</p>

<p>Last
week, the Minister of Education agreed to set up a
University Salaries Group, involving employers, unions and
the Government to look at ways of resolving salary problems
in the sector. This week the employers rejected a
cooperative approach.</p>

<p>Against this background the forum
promises to host some lively debate.</p>

<p>Note: The  Hunter
Building is the historic centrepiece building at Victoria
University. It can be reached by the first or second
driveways off to the left ascending Kelburn Parade. Hunter
Lecture Theatre 323 is on the third floor and is reached by
stairs at the south end of the building (not by the central
stairway).<p>
