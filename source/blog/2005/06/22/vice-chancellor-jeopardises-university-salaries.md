<p>Vice-Chancellor jeopardises University
Salaries Group</p>

<p>The University of Auckland Branch of the
Association of University Staff (AUS) says is of serious
concern that Auckland's Vice-Chancellor wishes to broaden
the agenda of the University Salaries Group (USG), which is
being established by the Minister of Education, to include
all university funding issues.<p>

<p>The Minister announced
last week that he is setting up the University Salaries
Group to consider and resolve issues around salaries in the
university sector.<p>

<p>AUS Auckland Branch President,
Associate Professor Peter Wills, said that salaries make up
approximately 56% of that University's expenditure, and
represent the most pressing issue for both AUS members and
the Government, as demonstrated by the establishment of the
USG. "Therefore, it is disappointing that the
Vice-Chancellor is publicly jeopardising the USG
initiative," he said.<p>

<p>"While the Vice-Chancellor is
critical of the unions for having a narrow focus on
improving salaries, it is the unions' view that salaries
have suffered at the expense of other priorities for the
last 15 years, both here and at other universities, and it
is now time for university employers, in cooperation with
the government, to formulate a proper, long-term solution to
the problem for the benefit of both staff and fee-paying
students," said Associate Professor Wills.</p>

<p>"The union has
"won" the establishment of the tripartite salaries group. In
terms of the battle to improve the position of university
staff it is the most significant development for as long as
many of us can remember," said Associate Professor Wills.<p>
<p>"As a union we are also keen to address issues such as
staff/student ratios, and improving the quality of teaching
and research facilities and equipment, but when the
Government acknowledges that university salaries are a major
problem and creates a forum to discuss and resolve the
relevant issues, then everything should be done to use that
limited opportunity to the maximum."<p>

<p>Associate Professor
Wills said he urged the Vice-Chancellor and the University
Council not to squander the opportunity in front of us by
trying to change the Government's mind about what it will
talk about, now that we finally have a hard-earned agreement
on the issue of salaries.<p>
