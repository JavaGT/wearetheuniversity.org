<p>Universities face prolonged strike action, and students face
disruption to the release of their examination results if
differences between university unions and employers over the
negotiation of new national multi-employer collective
agreements are not resolved in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>It is
the first time ever that industrial action has threatened to
close universities across the entire country.</p>

<p>More than 90
percent of staff who participated in a ballot, which closed
today, voted in favour of industrial action, after employers
at seven universities refused to agree to new multi-employer
agreements, and offered salary increases of between 2
percent (at Massey) and 4.5 percent (at Auckland) on a
single-employer basis.</p>

<p>Two days of national strike action
will occur on 20 July and 4 August, with rolling stoppages
scheduled to take place in the intervening period. First
semester examination results will be withheld
indefinitely.</p>

<p>The combined unions’ spokesperson, Helen
Kelly, said that today’s vote was an unprecedented rejection
of the employers’ position. “Unless they take a
fundamentally different stance, serious disruption will
occur,” she said.</p>

<p>Helen Kelly said the result showed
clearly that university staff are no longer prepared to
tolerate their employers’ unwillingness to seriously address
low salaries and inadequate funding in the sector. “The
current salary offers are amongst the lowest in the current
wage round, and show that university employers are not
prepared to work in a collective and collaborative manner to
address what are long-recognised funding and salary
problems,” she said. “Government and the employers both
accept the extent of these problems, and so it seems
extraordinary to us that they will not move towards a
realistic solution.”<p>
<p>Ms Kelly called on the employers to
work with the unions and the Government to address the
issues in a way that would ensure the long-term viability
and high-quality of the New Zealand University
system.</p>

<p>Negotiations will resume in Christchurch next week
with the assistance of an industrial mediator.</p>

<p>Please
note: Today’s result is a provisional one with the final
outcome to be confirmed on Monday.</p>

<p>Ends</p>
