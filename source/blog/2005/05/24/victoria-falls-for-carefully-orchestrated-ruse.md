         PRESS RELEASE : FOR IMMEDIATE USE</p><p>Victoria University
Falls for Carefully Orchestrated Ruse</p><p>While Victoria
University and their student magazine Salient have been
quick to proclaim that their artwork appearing on Craccum’s
front cover is a marketing coup, comments from the Craccum
team should force them to consider otherwise. “Really this
was just a PR stunt –and Victoria bought into it, literally”
said Craccum Co-Editor Stian Overdahl.</p><p>Craccum had decided
to do sell the cover at the beginning of the year, and this
was not done as a desperate attempt to make budget, as
reported by some news sites. “Our financial outlook is fine
and we’re actually way ahead of budget, which is good
because we’ve got some big plans for later on this year.
This was all just one stunt to raise publicity about student
media and the role of advertising”, said Stian Overdahl.    
</p><p>Victoria University were the eventual winners of the sale
on TradeMe for Craccum’s front cover, paying $2500 for the
honour. A press release from Victoria University called the
move, an attempt to recruit students to Wellington, a ‘raid’
as well as saying they had ‘high-jacked’ (sic) the Craccum
cover. Yet from Craccum’s perspective, Victoria University
purchasing the cover played nicely into their hands. 
</p><p>“The concept for the magazine was to completely
‘sell-out’ said Craccum Co-Editor Stian Overdahl. “Selling
the cover was just one facet – Victoria University have paid
two and a half grand to be just another corporation trying
to market itself to students. Will they be receptive to the
message? I don’t think so. Students are sick of their
demographic being targeted by marketers, and in a way this
issue is a response to the constant marketing bombardment
our age-group is exposed to”.

<p>Craccum Co-Editor
Alec Hutchinson stated, “I don’t think that they understand
that they’ve become part of the joke. For this issue, our
focus was on the commoditisation of content, as well as the
role of advertising. Instead of just writing about the issue
we decided to be dynamic, and selling the cover was part of
that. The ultimate goal was to juxtapose Craccum’s
traditional freedom with other parts of the magazine
industry, and hopefully get students to realise the value of
free student media.”  </p><p>The editors say they are incredibly
pleased Salient bought the cover. Co-Editor Alec Hutchinson
stated, “If it had been for example Hewlett Packard that
would have just been money. But with Victoria University it
shows that we’ve completely compromised our values, both
monetarily and ideologically, which was the initial point.
It’s also I guess funny that Victoria have tried to hype
this up into a PR spectacle. At the end of the day it’s up
to the students to decide whether it’s an effective ad or
just more vacuous
marketing.”</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
