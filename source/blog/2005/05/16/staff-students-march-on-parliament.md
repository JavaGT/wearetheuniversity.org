<p>Staff at Victoria University will be joining with students
in a protest march to Parliament this Tuesday lunchtime, 17
May, over the need for more government funding for
universities.</p>

<p>The march will leave the quad at Victoria
University in Kelburn at 12.30pm on Tuesday, and travel down
the Terrace to Parliament. The Minister for Tertiary
Education, Hon Trevor Mallard, will receive a presentation
from the combined group at a little after 1.00pm.</p>

<p>The
staff are members of the Association of University Staff
(AUS) which is claiming a 10% increase in salaries for all
staff this year and a further 10% increase in the subsequent
two years for academic staff, increases they say are
necessary if university salaries are to maintain any
relativity at all to those paid to similarly qualified staff
in New Zealand and overseas.</p>

<p>“This is the minimum we need
for salaries – but universities need increased funding from
government in order to deliver such an increase,” said AUS
Victoria University Branch President, Dr David Weatherburn.
“In fact, under-funding of universities has reached a crisis
point”.<p>

<p>Dr Weatherburn said that Victoria is facing a
fresh round of university budget cuts, which means the
problems caused by low salaries are now being compounded by
further constraints on resources, including the hiring of
new staff.  “With demand growing internationally for
qualified staff, and big increases in academic salaries
continuing to flow through in Australia, we will steadily
become unable to deliver the standard of university
education that New Zealanders want and need, both as
individuals and to build a knowledge-based economy,” he
said.<p>
<p>“Salaries for teachers in New Zealand’s primary and
secondary schools are now higher than many lecturers’
salaries, while the demands for research outputs and
supervision from university staff continue to grow,” said Dr
Weatherburn. “Government funds must be re-invested in the
engine room of the knowledge-based economy.”<p>
