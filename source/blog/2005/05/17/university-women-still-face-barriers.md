<p>Academic women are five times more likely than men to
believe that having time away from the workforce is a
barrier to promotion, and three times as likely to mention
the lack of affordable childcare, according to research
commissioned by the Association of University Staff. The
research, undertaken by the New Zealand Council for
Educational Research, examined gender and promotion at
Massey University as a case study of practices within New
Zealand universities.</p>

<p>Amongst the main findings were that
it showed that the women who participated in the survey were
only half as likely as men to feel they had reached the
academic level to which they had aspired. Not only did fewer
women than men express overall satisfaction with the
promotion processes, but they also reported less
satisfaction with their opportunities for promotion. More
women than men identified barriers to promotion such as high
teaching loads and a lack of time for
research.</p>

<p>Association of University Staff spokesperson,
Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, said the research
showed that while women may have an equal chance for
promotion, they were less likely to apply, particularly
those in the lower academic grades. “This points to the need
for universities to develop mechanisms to ensure that women,
particularly those at lecturer and senior lecturer levels,
have teaching loads which allow time for designated research
and the development of publications records,” she said. “It
also highlights the need for universities to look at the
broader issues which inhibit career development, in
particular the obstacles for women to make the transition
from fixed-term appointments to continuing positions and the
effect of time away from the workforce to tend to family
responsibilities.”<p>
<p>Associate Professor Montgomery thanked
Massey for allowing the research to be conducted at the
University.</p>

<p>The study looked at the experiences of 619
academic staff at Massey University.</p>
