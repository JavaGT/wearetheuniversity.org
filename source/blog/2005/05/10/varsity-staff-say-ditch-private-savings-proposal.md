<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has called on the
Government to ditch proposals for a tertiary education
savings scheme, saying it would be regressive and serve to
strengthen the view that tertiary education is a private
benefit which should be increasingly funded through
individual contribution.</p>

<p>This follows today’s call from
the Government’s for expressions of interest from groups
interested in providing individualised savings accounts from
which withdrawals could only be made for tertiary education
costs. Individuals with such accounts would only be able to
access student loans once they had withdrawn funds from
their tertiary education savings account.</p>

<p>AUS General
Secretary Helen Kelly said that AUS is committed to a
publicly-funded, high-quality education system which
provided equal access to all people, and not just those who
could afford to pay. “A private savings scheme would not
only favour those who can afford to save, but also would
discriminate against low-income families and groups such as
women who take time out from paid employment to meet family
responsibilities,” she said. “It also erodes the notion that
tertiary education is a public good.”</p>

<p>‘The introduction of
individualised savings to fund tertiary education would
expose New Zealand to the risk of developing a two-tier
tertiary education system: one for those who are able to
save privately and another, inferior one, for those
dependent on an under funded public system,” said Ms
Kelly.</p>

<p>Ms Kelly also said that an individual savings
scheme could well be used as a means of disguising the
effects of the controversial student loan scheme, but
without reducing the burden on individuals of paying for
their tertiary education. “Adequate funding is a state
responsibility”, she said, “and Government’s priority should
be to properly fund tertiary education.”<p>

<p>Government is
expected to make on decision on whether to proceed with such
a fund by August.</p>

<p>Ends</p>
