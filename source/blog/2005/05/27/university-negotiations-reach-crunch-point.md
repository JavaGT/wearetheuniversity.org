         Association of University Staff  <br>Media Release<br>27 May
2005</p><p>University negotiations reach crunch
point</p><p>Negotiations between the combined staff unions and
university employers made little progress yesterday after
the employers advised the unions that they were not prepared
to enter into multi-employer collective employment
agreements. As a result, the unions will now be considering
industrial action.</p><p>Most of the employers made salary
offers conditional on the unions accepting single employer
collective agreements. These offers ranged between 2 percent
(Massey) and 4.5 percent (Auckland, who made this offer
earlier and are already paying it to their staff). Victoria
University also made a lower offer to general staff than for
academic staff. Some of the universities are also claiming
significant claw backs to conditions of employment.</p><p>The
combined unions' negotiating team says that the salary
offers are inadequate and will be unacceptable to union
members. The employers claim that they do not have the
ability to pay more in the current funding environment, and
that they have made their best offers.</p><p>The combined unions
have claimed national agreements with salary increases which
would barely bring them into line with their Australian
counterparts, and would have university lecturers with
salaries similar to kindergarten, primary and secondary
school teachers in New Zealand. </p><p>Combined unions lead
advocate, Jeff Rowe, said that this is clear evidence that
the unions' claim for national multi-employer collective
agreements is the only viable strategy that will immediately
alleviate the crisis in university salaries, one which
government ministers have now openly recognised
