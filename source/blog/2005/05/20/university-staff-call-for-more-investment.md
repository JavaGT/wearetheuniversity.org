<p><br>University staff call for more investment in tertiary
education</p>

<p>University staff are calling on the Government
for further investment in high-quality tertiary education,
following the release of yesterday’s Budget.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Funding
for tertiary education in the Budget provided an additional
$75 million over the next four years for the
Performance-Based Research Fund and an increase of 2.6
percent to student component funding over each of the next
four years. $132 million from this and previous budgets will
be used to increase funding rates for strategically relevant
subject areas</p>

<p></p>

<p>“The $75 million increase in the
Performance Based Research Fund will be welcomed by
university staff,” said Professor Nigel Haworth, President
of the Association of University Staff. “The PBRF exercise
has proved that university staff are responsible for the
bulk of academic research in New Zealand, and that quality
should be rewarded by increased funding.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>Professor
Haworth went on to say, however, that there was little else
for universities in the budget, other than an inflation
catch-up for funding rates. “The Government shares our
concern that university salaries have not kept pace with
international rates, but it still needs to address this
issue. Government needs to work with unions and
vice-chancellors to implement mechanisms to fix this
problem, and ensure the recruitment and retention of the
highest quality staff in our universities.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>University
staff welcome the announcement of a funding re-allocation
exercise, scheduled to take place in the next few months,
saying it should shift significant levels of funding away
from low-quality low cost courses and into those run by
universities.<p>

<p></p>

<p>“Trevor Mallard has made it clear that
he wants to move funding away from low-quality providers and
qualifications. If the high-quality of our university
degrees and research is to be protected, he must move that
funding into universities,” said Professor Haworth.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ends</p>
