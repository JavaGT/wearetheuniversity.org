<p>Budget all Fizz, No Bang for
Students</p>

<p>The Government’s Budget is a step in the right
direction in terms of increased student support, but falls
far short of introducing worthwhile change for the majority
of students, says Auckland University Students Association
President Greg Langton.</p>

<p>Langton welcomed changes to the
Student Allowance scheme that would allow students to earn a
more liveable income from part-time work, but said that the
Government had failed to address the key issue of student
debt.</p>

<p>“This is all fizz, but no bang”, he said. “Labour
has been tinkering around edges of the system for the last
five years, without any real commitment to changing the
fundamental flaws inherited from National 6 years
ago.</p>

<p>“Labour are finally realising that they can’t rely on
the student vote, and this is a move to placate their
increasing anger,” says Education Vice President Xavier
Goldie, “Only time will tell if it’s too little too
late”</p>

<p>Langton called on the Government to develop a
tertiary education policy that contained vision. “It’s not
acceptable that we should have the same poor policies
recycled through every year. It’s high time that Labour
stepped up to the plate and came up with something that
really addressed the problems faced by the tertiary
sector.”</p>
