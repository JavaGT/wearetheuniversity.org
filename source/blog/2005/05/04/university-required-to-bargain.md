<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed a
decision by the full bench of the Employment Court requiring
the University of Auckland to participate, with other
universities, in bargaining for multi-employer collective
employment agreements (MECA).<p>

<p>The Court found in favour
of the AUS in relation to its central complaint, that the
Employment Relations Act requires the University to bargain
for a MECA.<p>

<p>The Court rejected the University’s
contention, that it was entitled to refuse to attend MECA
negotiations, stating that the law does not allow the
statutory process to be short-circuited by a party to the
bargaining, as the University attempted.</p>

<p>The Court also
criticised the Vice-Chancellor for the timing, unilateral
nature, and personal distribution of emails to staff, which
it thought “may, in all of the circumstances have undermined
the bargaining”. The Court held that the Vice-Chancellor
should not have made such communications until discussions
with the union about the bargaining process had been
undertaken.<p>

<p>AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly said that
the union wanted national bargaining because it would be
good for the entire university sector. “Salaries of the
magnitude needed in the sector, to ensure the recruitment
and retention of high-quality staff, would be achieved
through national collective agreements, and properly funded
by government,” she said.  “The Vice-Chancellor has been
short-sighted in his actions by opposing the MECA, and
bargaining had been delayed for months as a result.”<p>
<p>Ms
Kelly said the Vice-Chancellor had wasted valuable public
funding pursuing a bargaining strategy on legal advice that
which has been proven incorrect. “We hope he will now simply
get on with it and bargain,” she said.</p>
