<p>Unions, universities welcome extra funding<br>The combined
university unions and vice-chancellors have welcomed the
announcement today by the Minister for Tertiary Education,
Dr Michael Cullen, that university funding will be boosted
by $26 million per annum.</p>

<p>The additional funding has been
designated towards enhancing the long-term quality and
capability of the New Zealand university system, and comes
as a result of tripartite discussions between the
Government, Vice-Chancellors and the unions, constituting
the first step in resolving funding and salary problems in
the sector.</p>

<p>It has been agreed between the unions and
vice-chancellors that the additional funding will be used to
enhance salaries, which are seen as a priority area in terms
of ensuring the long-term sustainability and international
competitiveness of the sector.<p>

<p>Speaking on behalf of the
combined university unions, Association of University Staff
General Secretary, Helen Kelly, said that meetings would be
now be convened with union members at the universities to
determine the bargaining process for this year. “The
tripartite process has proved to be a successful way of
identifying and addressing issues within the university
sector,” she said. “It is our expectation that the second
stage of the tripartite process, already in train, will
build on the collaboration between the parties.”</p>

<p>Professor
Roy Sharp, Chair of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’
Committee, said that the additional funding was the first
step in a process to address the funding and salary issues
which had been identified. “It is gratifying that the
tripartite process has achieved a concrete result for
universities.”</p>
