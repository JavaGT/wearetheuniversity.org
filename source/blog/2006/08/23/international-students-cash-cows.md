<p>International Students “Cash Cows”</p>

<p>The University of
Auckland Council voted this week to increase international
student fees for 2007 by 5%, with the exception of
international students doing medicine who will have to pay
$45,000, up 17% from the 2006 fee level.  Auckland
University Students’ Association (AUSA) President Dan
Bidois said that “we’re unhappy with the outcome given
the current environment where international students are
already burdened with huge financial costs as it
is.”</p>

<p>International students pay an average of $20,000 in
tuition fees to study at The University of Auckland.  On top
of that international students face living expenses, medical
and health insurance costs, a student services levy,
building levy, internet charges and additional course
related costs such as text books and stationary.<p>

<p>“There’s a common misconception that international
students are rich and have money to burn”, said AUSA
Education Vice President Xavier Goldie.  “It is clear to
us that they are not particularly wealthy, with their
families either saving for years or taking out loans to pay
for their children’s education.  Many international
students take up extra part-time work just to cover their
tuition fees and end up living on 2 minute noodles for
dinner”, Mr Goldie added.</p>

<p>Mr Bidois added that he
wasn’t surprised with Councils decision to increase fees
even more for international students.  “There’s a common
feeling among international students that they get treated
by the university like ‘cash cows’ or ‘revenue
generators’ used to fill budget shortfalls in the
university’s finances.  Given that international
enrolments at The University of Auckland were down by almost
18% this year, it seemed almost a given that the university
would use this argument to simply raise fees even more”,
Mr Bidois Added.<p>

<p>Mr Goldie added that AUSA was concerned
that the increased fees would deter more students than it
would bring in.  “Eventually The University of Auckland
may be looking at a situation where the ‘cash cow’
leaves for greener
pastures.”</p>
