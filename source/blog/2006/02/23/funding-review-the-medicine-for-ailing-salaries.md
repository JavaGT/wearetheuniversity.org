<p>Funding review the medicine for ailing
salaries</p>

<p>The announcement that funding arrangements for
Medicine and Dentistry degree programmes will be reviewed
has been welcomed by the Association of University Staff
National President, Professor Nigel Haworth. He said that
Medical and Dental academic staff have for too long
subsidised Medical and Dental teaching at the Universities
of Otago and Auckland through low salaries and poor
conditions of employment, and any move to alleviate this
would find strong support.</p>

<p>The Minister for Tertiary
Education, Dr Michael Cullen, said that the review, to be
carried out this year, will ensure that there is sufficient
funding available to maximise training opportunities in
order that the country continues to produce the
highest-quality graduates.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that
government funding rates for Medicine and Dentistry remain
less in actual terms than they were in 1992, and that
current funding levels are now perilously close to
compromising the quality of the programmes. "It is our view
that the overall funding shortfall in Medicine is around
$81,699 over the cost of a degree, or $NZ13,616 per student
per annum, and in Dentistry by $64,920 over the cost of a
degree, or $12,584 per student per annum," he said. "That
funding shortfall had been borne by students through high
fees and by staff through low salaries."</p>

<p>Professor Haworth
said that a significant problem is the disparity between
salaries paid to Medical and Dental specialists within the
public health system and those in the universities. "Despite
an international acceptance that salary rates should be
comparable, the current difference in base-salaries is
around $20,000 per year," he said. "Under current salary
structures, that differential will balloon to $49,000 within
eight years unless action is taken. That is completely
untenable."<p>
<p>Specialists employed in New Zealand's only
Dental School at the University of Otago are paid around
half the amount received by their colleagues in private
practice.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that a major problem
faced by the universities is their ability to recruit or to
retain specialist staff in an increasing number of clinical
specialties.</p>

<p>The review will be carried out by officials
from the Tertiary Education Commission and Ministry of
Education who are expected to report back to the Minister
later this year to ensure any changes can be in place for
the next academic
year.</p>
