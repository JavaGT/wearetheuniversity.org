<p>University staff pay for poor management
as academic values go down the drain</p>

<p>University of
Auckland staff say they are paying the cost of poor
management and inadequate planning, following confirmation
that twenty-one full time staff academic positions are to be
cut from the University’s Faculty of Arts.<p>

<p>The
Faculty’s Academic Staffing Confirmation Document,
released last week, says that nine academic staff positions
are to be disestablished from the Arts, with a further 12.25
full-time positions to be lost through retirement, natural
attrition and/or voluntary severance. A further thirty-three
jobs are expected to go from the Faculties of Education and
Business.</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS)
Auckland Branch President, Dr Helen Charters, said that the
University’s decision to cut jobs was a crude and
short-sighted action, caused primarily by a management which
has failed to take account of demographic trends, fiddled
with degree structures and increased student fees, and which
has acted in a way that generally entrenches a destructive
market-mentality “bums-on-seats” approach to public
education.</p>

<p>Dr Charters said that the University was
compromising the academic well-being of the University by
making decisions based solely on a short-term financial
basis without consideration to the academic consequences of
its decisions. “The Vice-Chancellor acts as though the
University is a corporation, where each staff member is
expected to turn a profit, and where academic and social
values are given only token acknowledgement,” she said.
“This undermines important functions of a university; to
ensure the advancement of knowledge, to foster and protect
critical thinking and to advance the country’s social and
economic development.”<p>
<p>Dr Charters said that, when
those charged with governance of the University fail in
their duty to defend academic values, it was the moral and
legal responsibility of every academic to speak out. She
said that AUS would continue to fight the proposed job
losses, to defend academic standards and values and seek a
more collaborative relationship with the governors and
managers of the university.</p>
