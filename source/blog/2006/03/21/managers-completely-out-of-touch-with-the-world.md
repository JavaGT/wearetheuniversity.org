<p>University managers "completely out
of touch with the world".</p>

<p>The President of the Canterbury
Branch of the Association of University Staff (AUS), David
Small, has branded as "staggeringly misguided" the "change
proposal" released by the University of Canterbury this
morning calling for eight more redundancies in the
Arts.</p>

<p>The change proposal specifies the programmes from
which academic staff will be made redundant.  "A cursory
glance reveals that this proposal has been drawn up by
people who are completely out of touch with the world around
them," said Dr Small.</p>

<p>He pointed to two of the cuts, those
in Chinese and Religious Studies.</p>

<p>"The whole world is
looking to China as an emerging power Â­ politically,
militarily and economically.  New Zealand politicians,
business leaders and educational institutions, including the
University of Canterbury, have put huge amounts of energy
into developing an understanding of and building
relationships with China.  What kind of signal does the
university think it will send by axing one of only four
academics in its Chinese programme at a time when it is
making a $9.2 million surplus?  Has anybody calculated how
much marketing money the university has wasted with such a
foolish decision?"</p>

<p>"For the last five years, people all
around the world have had their hard-won civil liberties
removed as a result of a seemingly intractable conflict
between people acting largely on religious motivations, and
those in the West who are perceived to be their enemies. 
Just months ago, there was widespread incomprehension in
most Western countries at why so many muslims were so upset
about cartoons being published that they considered
offensive.  There has never been a more important time to
increase understanding in New Zealand and the West about
Islam.  But the University of Canterbury has decided to cut
Religious Studies (which already had a staff member not
replaced at the end of last year) by another staff member
and for that cut to be made in Islamic Studies."<p>
<p>"This is
what happens when decisions with profound academic,
political and economic implications are left in the hands of
short-sighted bean-counters", he said.</p>

<p>Dr Small said that
the situation has clearly got out of hand, and has appealed
to the public to call the managers of this public university
to account.  He has asked people to express their concern by
supporting a rally on campus this Wednesday at 1pm,
organised by the student group, Save Our Staff.</p>
