         29 March 2006 </p><p>Arrival of interest-free student loans
celebrated</p><p>Auckland University students celebrate the
arrival of interest-free student loans </p><p>As students all
over the country wait eagerly for the arrival of
interest-free student loans on April 1st, plans are afoot to
celebrate the occasion in grand style. </p><p>Auckland
University Students' Association (AUSA) President Dan Bidois
says that "the campaign to get interest free loans for
students could not have been achieved without the hard work
and commitment of the New Zealand University Students'
Association (NZUSA) which AUSA is an associate member of."
</p><p>To recognise this dedication to the student cause and
what they have achieved, AUSA is holding a 'Losing Your
Interest' party in the Quad of the Student Union Building
this Friday 31st of March. Billed as a light-hearted
celebration to recognise this major success for the student
movement, the event will feature free food, refreshments,
candy and balloons. Information will be provided to students
explaining how the interest-free student loan system will
work, and clued-up AUSA student representatives will be on
hand to answer any questions that students may have.
</p><p>While the end of interest on student loans is a huge step
forward for the student movement, it is only early days in
the long journey towards a national barrier-free education
for all New Zealanders. </p><p>"We hope to see real positive
changes to the attitudes and behaviours of prospective and
current students due to the scheme. According to a recent
survey of school leavers conducted by NZUSA 78% of
respondents stated that current fee levels were too high. We
hope the introduction of the interest free student loan
scheme will encourage more students to enter tertiary
education studies and further encourage current tertiary
students to seek higher education at post-graduate level",
Mr Bidois added.

<p>With student debt currently estimated at
around $8.4billion there is certainly much more to be done.
AUSA, NZUSA and the many other dedicated students'
associations around the country will continue their efforts,
endeavouring to build upon this success and make it the
foundation for many more. As AUSA Education Vice-President
Xavier Goldie says, "While this is a watershed for the
student movement, we need to see more progressive policies
like this continue to make positive changes for students."
</p><p>"Changes such as a universal student allowance for all
students are such changes that we hope current and future
governments are up to the challenge of implementing." Mr
Bidois said.
