<p>University threatens action against
union</p>

<p>The University of Canterbury has threatened action
against the Association of University Staff (AUS), following
an email petition launched by AUS support of workers locked
out by Progressive Enterprises in their current industrial
dispute.</p>

<p>The threat of action follows an earlier mover by
the University, which saw it block a website-based petition
which invited University employees to add their names to a
statement declaring that they would boycott Countdown,
Woolworths and Foodtown supermarkets in protest against the
current lockout of Progressive Enterprises Distribution
Centre workers.</p>

<p>In a letter to the AUS Canterbury Branch
President, Dr David Small, the University's Director of
Human Resources, Paul O'Flaherty, said that, if words
identifying the signatories as staff members of the
University, were not removed, the University would be forced
to take action against the AUS to stop the petition from
being sent. The letter said that "the words 'employees of
the University of Canterbury' are unacceptable because they
risk external parties seeing this as a UC initiative or
stance."</p>

<p>Dr Small said that, without discussion or
notification, the University ordered an employee to close
down a website being used to gather signatures for the
petition, and that the email petition was subsequently used
to allow staff members to voice support for the locked-out
workers. "The petition never purported to be a formal
University position, but it is a fact that those staff who
signed the petition are members of Canterbury University
staff," he said. "In a similar way, some students are
supporting the locked-out Progressive workers, but it is not
considered for one moment that they represent the formal
view of the University."<p>
<p>Dr Small said that freedom of
expression, the open exchange of ideas and engagement with
the community are fundamentals to the role of a university.
"To threaten presumably legal action against the AUS in such
a manner is not only heavy handed, but runs counter to the
principles of academic freedom and the responsibility of the
institution to act as critic and conscience of society," he
said. "University management is acting like the thought
police."</p>

<p>The AUS has refused to give University management
an assurance that it will alter the words before the
petition is
sent.</p>
