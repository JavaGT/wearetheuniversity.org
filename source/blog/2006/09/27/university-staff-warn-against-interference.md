	 <p>
         The Association of University Staff (AUS) says that academic
research must be free of political interference, in a
response to the announcement today by the Government that it
is to seek a report from the Marsden Fund into the
background of its decision-making processes, .</p><p>The
decision to seek the report follows criticisms from National
Party MP, Dr Paul Hutchison, including comments that that
funding is going towards research on topics associated with
sex and that $9 million of the $38 million of Marsden
funding this year went to projects associated with nine
members of the judging panel.</p><p>The Marsden Fund
allocates annually public money from a contestable pool to
researchers in order to build New Zealand’s fundamental
research knowledge base, contribute to the global
advancement of knowledge, and broaden and deepen the
research skill base in New Zealand. </p><p>AUS National
President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said that Marsden
funding was allocated on the basis of internationally
refereed research proposals, and administered by
internationally respected, senior researchers.</p><p>Professor Haworth said that Dr Hutchison’s assertion
that research funding appeared to be going to “nebulous”
subjects rather than to others such Physics, Chemistry and
Mathematics, is an ill-judged and regrettable attack on the
credibility and reputation of some of New Zealand’s
leading academics, and was perilously close to an attack on
academic freedom.<br>“Academic staff and students in New
Zealand have the duty and right to engage in research and to
regulate the subject matter of academic courses free from
political interference” said Professor Haworth.
“Academic staff conform to the highest ethical standards
in exercising their academic responsibilities, and it is an
affront to those standards and people for Dr Hutchison to
make claims, which, on the face of things, seek to direct
Mardsen funding allocation to subjects approved by the
National Party. This type of politicisation of research will
be noted internationally and will rebound on New Zealand in
terms of its ability to recruit top-class scholars and
become involved in international research efforts”
