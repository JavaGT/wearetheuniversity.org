<p>University staff warn of National’s
leap backwards</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff says
that the National Party is gearing up to return
tertiary-education to the uncontrolled free-market approach
of the 1990’s, encouraging competition rather than
cooperation among public tertiary-education providers, and
making them less accountable for their actions.</p>

<p>In a major
speech to the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic this morning,
National Party Leader, Dr Don Brash, said that, if elected,
National would reduce the education bureaucracy and allow
institutions alone to make decisions according to what he
described as a “high-trust” model with fewer rules about
how they operate.<p>

<p>AUS general Secretary, Helen Kelly said
that, while Dr Brash noted that governments owe it to
taxpayers and students to ensure that the tertiary education
dollar is being spent wisely, it was naïve to believe that
institutions acting in isolation to each other would make
decisions in the best national interest.</p>

<p>“Recent history
shows that deregulation of tertiary education resulted in
the unnecessary duplication of courses, an escalation of
student tuition fees and the breakdown in cooperation and
collaboration among tertiary-education providers,” Ms
Kelly said. “National’s proposals would mean that
current policies, aimed towards a clearly defined long-term
strategy and planned direction for tertiary-education in New
Zealand, would inevitably break down.”<p>
<p>Ms Kelly said
that current policy proposals, such as recognising and
funding different types of tertiary-education providers on
the basis of their distinctive roles, rewarding constructive
behaviour and regulating student tuition fees would 
resulting in better and more productive education outcomes
for the country as a whole, and that these would be
compromised if Dr Brash’s free-market approach
prevailed.</p>

<p>Ms Kelly also said that attacking the
tertiary-education “bureaucracy”, such as proposed by Dr
Brash, would see a return to the types of behaviour such as
the funding rorts and enrolment inducements that had been
evidenced from the likes of the Christchurch Polytechnic and
Institute of Technology in the last few
years.</p>
