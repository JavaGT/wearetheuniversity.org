<p>Media Release     8 May 2006</p>

<p>University Union Accuses VC
of Deliberately Misleading the Ombudsman</p>

<p>The Canterbury
Branch of the Association of University Staff (AUS) is
lodging a formal complaint with the Attorney-General and
Minister of Tertiary Education, Dr Michael Cullen, accusing
the University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy
Sharp, of deliberately giving false information to the
Ombudsman.</p>

<p>The information is basic data about the
financial performance of various university
departments.</p>

<p>The AUS is also alleging that the
university¹s refusal to supply the information prevented
proper consultation over a proposal to make eight academic
staff redundant in the College of Arts. A final announcement
on redundancies is due on Wednesday (May 10).</p>

<p>The dispute
began on 14 March when AUS Canterbury President, David
Small, requested information about the contribution margins
(rate of surplus) of departments outside those targeted in
the College of Arts.  After a month, the VC refused to
provide the information, citing concerns about how the data
might be used.</p>

<p>Dr Small appealed to the Ombudsman on the
grounds that the refusal was not based on any of the lawful
reasons in Section 9 of the Official Information Act.<p>

<p>When the Ombudsman investigated, the VC advised him that
the information being sought ³does not exist².</p>

<p>Dr Small
then wrote to all Heads in the university asking for the
data in relation to their departments.</p>

<p>Within an hour of
that email being circulated, the Vice-Chancellor called and
offered to provide the ³non-existent² information.<p>
<p>By the
time the information was provided, the consultation period
for the redundancies had ended.</p>

<p>Dr Small describes the
university¹s behaviour as ³thoroughly reprehensible and
almost certainly illegal².</p>

<p>³The university knew this
information was needed for proper consultation over the
redundancies and withholding seems like a blatant breach of
the Employment Relations Act.  And then it responded to an
Ombudsman¹s request with a declaration that looks like a
blatant lie.²</p>
