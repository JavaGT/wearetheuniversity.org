<p>New funding arrangements welcome, say
university staff</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS)
has welcomed the announcement of a new funding system for
tertiary education, saying differentiation between the types
of tertiary education organisations will allow the high
overhead costs faced by research-based universities to be
recognised by the Government.</p>

<p>The Minister for Tertiary
Education, Dr Michael Cullen, this morning announced that
the current system, of funding tertiary education simply on
the basis of enrolments would be replaced by one which
recognised the distinctive nature of tertiary education
organisations. Funding would also be determined on the basis
of three year plans, outlining how each institution will
meet the education and training needs of students, employers
and communities.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Professor Nigel
Haworth, said that it had long been accepted that
universities have been disadvantaged by the current
EFTS-based or "bums-on-seats" funding model, and today's
announcement ought to make it possible for universities to
be funded to deliver high-quality university education. "The
three year funding cycle will also allow institutions to
make better long-term strategic decisions," he
said.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth also noted that this announcement
is one aspect of a longer term reform project and emphasised
the AUS commitment to the project's consultation
process.</p>

<p>The new funding system will be phased in from
2008</p>
