<p>Media Release</p>

<p>AUSA
cautiously optimistic about funding</p>

<p>The Auckland
University Students Association (AUSA) cautiously welcomed
the Government’s announcement of a new funding system for
the tertiary sector, unveiled by Tertiary Education Minister
Dr Michael Cullen today.</p>

<p>“AUSA views the new system as a
step in the right direction for the sector”, said AUSA
President Dan Bidois. “Under the current “Bums on
Seats” system, institutions at all levels are compelled to
mass produce graduates with qualifications of dubious
quality to survive. We welcome the move away from that
system, which focuses more on quality teaching and learning
outcomes for students at all levels of the sector”, he
said.</p>

<p>Mr Bidois added that the new “Distinctive
Contributions” component of funding system would better
allow the Government to recognise and fund the unique roles
that the universities, technical institutes, wąnanga and
industry training organisations (ITOs) play in shaping the
graduates of tomorrow. “We are optimistic that the
Distinctive Contributions funding component will better
allow Auckland University to enhance the excellent research
and research informed teaching for which it is renowned”,
he said.</p>

<p>AUSA Education Vice President Xavier Goldie added
that AUSA was concerned that the new system failed to
address the more fundamental problems of chronic sector
under-funding. “We are worried that, while a positive
start, the new funding system will not address the root
problem of universities being under-funded,” he said.
“The University of Auckland is under constant pressure to
cut costs and increase revenue to make up for a government
funding short fall, resulting in higher fees and potentially
lower quality degrees. We hope that the Tertiary Education
Minister takes this opportunity to address those far more
fundamental problems to ensure that his desired outcome of a
higher quality tertiary education sector is
achieved.</p>
