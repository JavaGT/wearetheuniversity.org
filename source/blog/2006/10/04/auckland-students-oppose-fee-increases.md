         Auckland Students Oppose Fee Increases</p><p>The Auckland
University Students Association (AUSA) today signalled their
opposition to the University's intention to increase
domestic tuition fees for 2007, with the launch of their
"Fight the Fees" campaign. </p><p>The University of Auckland
Council are due to consider a vote to increase fees for
2007, across both undergraduate and postgraduate courses, at
their next meeting on Monday 16 October at 4pm. Students
will be protesting the fee increases at that meeting. AUSA
President Dan Bidois said that AUSA would be campaigning
solidly over the next two weeks to highlight the problems
with raising tuition fees as the solution to an increase in
University costs.</p><p>"AUSA recognises that the University's
costs are increasing at a rate higher than the Government is
funding them. The University has indicated that their costs
will rise by margins greater than 5% in 2007, while the
Government has only committed to a 2.5% increase in funding
for that same period" said Mr Bidois. "As a result, the
University is facing a substantial deficit, manifesting in
budget cuts and staff redundancies across several
faculties", he added.</p><p>"However, students at the University
of Auckland already pay the highest tuition fees in the
country. Students are burdened with meeting those fees,
along with the higher costs associated with living in the
Auckland region. All of this results in greater levels of
student hardship and debt", Mr Bidois continued. "We do not
accept that it is the students at the University who should
be saddled with greater financial problems because of the
Government's failure to adequately fund the University
Sector. We call on the Government to step up to its
responsibility to fund Universities in a meaningful way,
allowing them to create and contribute knowledge to our
community without unnecessarily burdening our students and
our graduates with financial hardship."

<p>AUSA Education
Vice President Xavier Goldie urged the University Council
and the Vice Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon to work more
closely with other Tertiary sector organisations such as
AUSA, the New Zealand Union of Students Associations (NZUSA)
and the Association of University Staff (AUS) to pressure
the Government to increase their commitment to quality
University teaching and excellent research.</p><p>"With the new
landscape of the Tertiary sector unfolding as a result of
funding reforms, there are significant opportunities to make
important gains a more equitably and sustainably resourced
University sector", Mr Goldie said. "The University of
Auckland needs to step up to the plate and engage in good
faith with NZUSA and AUS to promote the concerns of the
sector to the Government. Students, staff, academics and
Management are all in this together; none of us want to see
the decline in productivity and quality that underfunding
invariably brings", he added.</p><p>"Raising student fees are
not an innovative, sustainable or long term strategy for
dealing with revenue-cost disparities. They are a drop in
the bucket of what is truly needed for our excellent
University to continue its leadership in the Tertiary
sector, and they only serve to increase student hardship",
he continued. "It's time for a bold, fresh new approach to
the problems that the University faces, and that can only be
achieved by collaboration between all those stakeholders -
staff, students and management - within the sector."</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
