<p>Increase of confidence
for Māori</p>

<p>Māori members of the Association of University
Staff (AUS) today met with the Associate Minister of
Education, Hon Parekura Horomia, and have an increase of
confidence in the consultation process around the Tertiary
Education Strategy.<p>

<p>“Following the meeting this
morning, we are confident that our concerns around the
inclusion of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and a Māori tertiary
component in the Tertiary Education Strategy will be acted
upon by the Minister” said Naomi Manu, AUS Māori
Officer.</p>

<p>“It is important that agencies accountable to
the NZ Government allow a transparent and stringent
consultation process with key stakeholders” said Leighton
Te Kowhai-Tuagalu, AUS Tuarua Māori.  “The meeting with
the Minister today has given us assurances to this
effect.”<p>
