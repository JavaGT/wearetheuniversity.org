<p>Māori University Staff Email Hikoi to
Parliament</p>

<p>Government is currently consulting on the draft
Tertiary Education Strategy (TES) and Statement of Tertiary
Education Priorities which will set the direction for
Tertiary education in the next five years.</p>

<p>Māori staff
and students have been shocked that the Māori component in
this process, the Māori Education Strategy, is not likely
to be included in the next TES until it is released in June
or July of next year.  “The Government has essentially
left a great policy hole for Māori in tertiary education
through their mismanagement in the timing of the release of
these strategies” said the Association of University Staff
(AUS) Māori Officer, Naomi Manu.</p>

<p>“The TES needs to
include a strategy to address the tertiary educational needs
and priorities for Māori that shows a commitment to Te
Tiriti” says AUS Vice-President Māori, Dr Fiona Te Momo.
“The Government needs to refrain from depending solely on
the Māori Education Strategy to provide this service,”
she said.</p>

<p>Māori staff and students are also concerned
about the omission of Te Tiriti o Waitangi from the
discussion documents around the development of the second
TES.</p>

<p>AUS and Te Kahurangi Whaiti are launching a campaign
to have Māori specific priorities included in the second
Tertiary Education Strategy.<p>

<p>The campaign includes an
email hikoi to the submission inbox at the Ministry of
Education.  A brief submission has been written outlining
the concerns around Te Tiriti and the Māori content in the
second TES.  Those would participate in the campaign will
add their name to the submission and it will be
automatically submitted.</p>

<p>“We invite wide participation
in this campaign. We want the Government to know that this
is a real concern to Māori,” said Dr Te Momo.</p>

<p>The
submission can be found at http://www.aus.ac.nz/postcard.asp<p>
