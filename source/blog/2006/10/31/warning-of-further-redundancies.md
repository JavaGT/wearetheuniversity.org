<p>Warning of further redundancies at University of
Auckland</p>

<p>There could be further redundancies among
academic staff at the University of Auckland if the School
of Biological Sciences' risky venture to build a new biotech
centre falls below budget targets.  Members of the
Association of University Staff (AUS) at the school are
watching what is happening in the Business, Education and
Arts Faculties and are worried that they could lose their
jobs.</p>

<p>The Dean of Science has said that the
possibility of redundancies among academic staff cannot be
ruled out in the event that plans to make money from
partnerships with pharmaceutical and agribusiness concerns
fail.</p>

<p>The University's Budget Committee meets on
Tuesday to approve building the multi-million dollar
Institute for Innovation in Biotechnology that will be
attached to the School of Biological Sciences.</p>

<p>“The University is using completely the wrong model
for partnership with biotechnology business interests,”
said Associate-Professor Peter Wills, AUS Auckland Branch
spokesperson.  “There should be an absolute firewall
between the academic and business sides of operations such
as this. Instead, they talk of a seamless connection with
biotechnology companies, they distort the balance of
academic programmes and then they raise the possibility of
redundancies among academic staff.  We are all sympathetic
to the University’s need to develop new sources of
revenue, but academic autonomy and integrity cannot be put
at risk.”<p>
<p>“The plan to graft a large business
enterprise onto the School of Biological Sciences was not
discussed by the school's external Advisory Board. 
Everything is secret, supposedly on the grounds of
commercial sensitivity, but the conflict of interest issues
are enormous.<p>

<p>Academic staff do not get to look properly
into the plan unless they sign up for it even though Vote
Education funds are being diverted away from their
fields,” said Associate Professor Wills.  “Overseas
visitors look in amazement at the failure of the University
to protect academic interests as it pursues money making. 
What is being done here would simply not be allowed in
countries such as the United States.”</p>

<p>Associate-Professor Wills said the plans should be put
on hold until the University could guarantee the integrity
of academic programmes and security of tenure for academic
staff.</p>
