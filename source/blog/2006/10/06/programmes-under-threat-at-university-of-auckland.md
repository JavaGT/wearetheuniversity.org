<p><br>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>6 October
2006</p>

<p>Prestige programmes under threat at University of
Auckland</p>

<p>Senior members of the Association of University
Staff (AUS) at the University of Auckland are outraged that
the Dean of Arts and the Vice-Chancellor have proposed
savage staffing cuts that could destroy prestigious academic
programmes in the Faculty of Arts.  Rather than allow
adequate time for staff to develop less destructive
alternatives, the Vice-Chancellor is determined to proceed
with haste on selecting staff for redundancy.</p>

<p>At a Faculty
meeting on Wednesday, the Dean of Arts refused to consider
an extension of time for consultation, saying this was a
staffing matter that fell outside the body's jurisdiction. 
In a letter addressed to seventeen members of Senate, the
Vice-Chancellor said that he would not extend the period of
consultation on the Arts restructuring proposal because the
delay would turn out to be too costly.</p>

<p>AUS President,
Associate Professor Peter Wills, said the fact is that in
some departments the redundancies will have an enormous
effect on the teaching programmes. "They will have a
significant effect even in departments which may lose only
one member of staff," he said. "The intention to abolish the
Russian programme follows the termination of Indonesian
language a few years ago, ignoring indications from
government that more extensive language education should be
recognised as a vital cornerstone in New Zealand's economic
development."<p>
<p>Associate Professor Wills said that the
proposed redundancies in the Arts Faculty showed that the
University had failed to set a budget that bore any relation
to reality, and had then used bums-on-seats micro-accounting
to decide on academic staffing levels and the constitution
of its courses.<p>

<p>"They encourage inflated projections of
the likely student market and then want to sack staff when
their plans come adrift, but large-scale non-academic
expenditure proceeds regardless. Some staff who may lose
their jobs have given over forty years of service to
students and their disciplines, and are world renowned
scholars who have contributed significantly to creating this
university's status and international rankings.  Others with
lower profiles are equally dedicated to an institution that
is prepared to discard them with apparent impunity.
Ironically they may take the advertising slogan 'The Number
One University in New Zealand' with them," said Associate
Professor Wills.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Wills said that it
was a sad day when the Association of University Staff had
to fight against senior personnel in order to maintain
proper academic standards and processes of
governance.</p>
