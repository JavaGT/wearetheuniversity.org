<p>“Immediate Suspension and Complete
Reassessment of Arts Cuts at Canterbury Needed After Today’s
Government Tertiary Education Announcement”<p>

<p>******</p>

<p>Staff at the University of Canterbury are
welcoming today’s policy announcement by the Minister of
Tertiary Education, and are claiming that it shows the need
for an immediate suspension and complete reassessment of the
University’s plans to make further cuts in the Arts.</p>

<p>“At
the very time the government is announcing a move away from
what it calls ‘the current, overly simplistic, Student
Component funding system’, the University is axing staff
based entirely on that measure,” said Association of
University Staff (AUS) Canterbury President, David
Small.</p>

<p>Dr Small said that there is widespread support
among staff for Dr Cullen’s view that universities are more
effective in their basic mission of serving the public when
they organise their research and teaching around a plan that
is responsive to the economic and social needs of their
community and the country, and that is developed in
consultation with the university’s diverse
stakeholders.</p>

<p>He said that the university’s plan to cut
eight positions in Arts was being implemented without any
consideration of factors that the Minister identified as
essential for a university, such as fostering “critical
thinking and innovation”, acting as “the conscience and
critic of society”, and supporting “the flexibility and
innovation that comes with independence of thought”.<p>
<p>Dr
Small said that Dr Cullen’s statement reinforces AUS’s
argument that it is simply unacceptable for a New Zealand
university today to be using such a blunt financial
instrument to make cuts with profound academic, social and
economic costs, and to remain completely unmoved by such
widespread opposition from within the university and the
wider community.</p>

<p>Last year, the University of Canterbury
recorded a financial surplus of $9.2 million, up 50% on the
previous year, $2.5 million ahead of budget, and at the
upper end of government guidelines on appropriate levels of
surplus for a university.<p>

<p>Despite this, it is continuing
with plans to cut $2million from the Arts, a move that it
claims requires forced redundancies among academic staff. 
The programmes targetted are Russian, Islamic Studies, Asian
History, Education, American Studies, English, Chinese, and
Music.<p>

<p>The cuts are being made in the absence of an
academic plan and in the face of a unanimous vote of
condemnation from the Faculty of Humanities and Social
Sciences.  The university released a change proposal on 20
March with submissions closing on 20 April.</p>
