<p>NZQA research worthless, says university staff<br>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has labelled as
worthless research released yesterday by the New Zealand
Qualifications Authority, purporting to show that New
Zealanders have what is described as a “middling” level of
confidence in the quality of tertiary education provided.<p>

<p>A telephone survey of 750 New Zealanders aged eighteen
years or over conducted by UMR Research, indicated that 36
percent of those surveyed have a positive view of the
quality of tertiary education, 36 percent a neutral view and
24 percent a negative view. Few respondents hold strong
opinions, with 9 percent saying they have a lot of
confidence and an equal number having “hardly any
confidence”.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Professor Nigel
Haworth said today that the publication of these results was
disappointing and contributed little to the current debate
about the future of the tertiary sector. In particular, the
report failed to define tertiary education or to distinguish
between a wide range of tertiary education providers, or the
types of education or the qualifications each provided.<p>

<p>Moreover, Professor Haworth said that public confidence
in some areas of the tertiary education sector may have been
undermined because of the politicisiation of some
high-profile occurrences incidents over the past few years.<p>

<p>“This new information fails to provide any basis on which
to improve quality,” Professor Haworth said. “The report
tells us nothing that can be of use whatsoever in improving
and ensuring the quality of tertiary education, and it seems
extraordinary that a public-sector education agency would
distribute information of such poor calibre.”<p>
