14 December 2006</p><p>University staff welcomes Tertiary
Education Strategy</p><p>The Association of University Staff
(AUS) has welcomed the new Tertiary Education Strategy
released this morning by the Government, saying that it will
allow for long-term and sustainable planning in the
sector.</p><p>Broadly, the Strategy expects the
tertiary-education sector to contribute to the
transformation of the New Zealand economy through lifelong
learning, by creating and applying knowledge to drive
innovation and by building strong connections between
tertiary-education organisations and the communities they
serve. It also sets out the Government’s expectations and
priorities for how the sector will contribute to the
Government’s goals, not just for the economy but also for
families and national identity.</p><p>AUS National President,
Professor Nigel Haworth, said that AUS members had been
actively engaged in consultation around the Strategy
document, particularly around the need to incorporate Maori
content. “We are very pleased to see that our feedback on
the draft Strategy has been heeded, and that there is now
extensive information about what the Strategy means for
Maori and Pasifika peoples,” he said. “We still note,
however, that the Treaty of Waitangi needs to be more
comprehensively incorporated into the strategic direction of
tertiary education.” </p><p>Professor Haworth said that AUS
strongly supports most elements of the new funding system
which underpins the Strategy: three year funding,
distinctive contributions for universities and a move away
from a purely enrolment driven system. “The implementation
of the new funding system will be a key to ensuring the
success of the Strategy,” he said.

<p>Professor Haworth
said that AUS also endorses the goals to build the
excellence of university research and increase the
application of that research to economic, social and
cultural development. “It is essential that the breadth
and quality of university research is supported through
funding policies, rather than having too narrow a focus on
improving creating economic opportunities. While links with
industry are vital for universities, community engagement is
equally vital,” he said.  Economic opportunities need to
be considered alongside social benefits, and the fundamental
independence of academic research at New Zealand
universities.”</p><p>Ends</p><p><!-- LINKS REMOVED
