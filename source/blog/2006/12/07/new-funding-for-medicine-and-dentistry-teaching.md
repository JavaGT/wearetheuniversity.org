<p>New funding for Medicine and Dentistry
teaching welcomed</p>

<p>The announcement that funding for
Medicine and Dentistry degree programmes will be increased
by $24.6 million has been warmly welcomed by the Association
of University Staff (AUS).<p>

<p>The additional funding has
been allocated following a review which identified that
there is a significant level of under funding for
undergraduate medicine and dentistry education, and that our
Schools of Medicine and Dentistry need to be able to recruit
and retain highly skilled staff and that students have
access to the highest quality learning.</p>

<p>AUS National
President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said that the additional
funding announced today comes on top of a $26 million
funding package which resulted from the tripartite process
among the Government, unions and vice-chancellors earlier in
the year. “The additional funding which has come into the
sector has shown the real value of constructive engagement
with Government on important issues within the sector,” he
said.<p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that a major problem facing
the universities was the disparity between salaries paid to
Medical and Dental specialists within the public health
system and those in the universities. “Despite an
internationally accepted view that salary rates between
these to groups should be comparable, the current difference
in base-salaries is around $20,000 per year,” he said.
“Had this new funding not been made available, that
differential would have ballooned to $49,000 within eight
years.”<p>
<p>Current per student funding rates will be
increased by more than $13,000 in Medicine and $14,000 in
Dentistry from 1 January 2007.</p>

<p>Professor Haworth said that
he expected this would allow for immediate negotiations
between the Universities of Otago and Auckland to ensure
that the additional funding supported the Government’s
objective of addressing staff recruitment and retention
issues.</p>
