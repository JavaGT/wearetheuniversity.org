         Association of University Staff</p><p>30 January
2008</p><p><br>Latest university job cuts a return to “bums on
seats” model</p><p>A proposal to cut more than twenty jobs
from the University of Canterbury’s College of Arts have
been labeled by staff as disappointing and possibly damaging
to the long-term viability of the College.</p><p>Among a number
of measures revealed in a restructuring plan released today,
the University will axe Theatre and Film Studies and
American Studies in a bid to cut more than $2 million from
the College of Arts budget.</p><p>Association of University
Staff (AUS) Canterbury Branch President, Professor Jack
Heinemann, says that successive rounds of staff cuts,
interspersed with hiring freezes, is pushing the University
to a tipping point. “The decision to cut staff numbers
appears to be largely based on the former bums-on-seats
funding model despite the new tertiary education strategy
which takes a more considered approach, allowing for
additional funding for strategically important areas,” he
said. </p><p><br>“University management needs to assert the
case for better funding to government and society in general
instead of taking the easy option of cutting staff numbers
to save money. For example, American Studies is unique to
Canterbury. There must be a case for the strategic value of
our Arts Faculty to be made to Government. That is the kind
of vision and leadership our campus needs.”</p><p>Professor
Heinemann said that the AUS would be supporting affected
staff and fighting to maintain a strong College. “AUS will
be arguing that management needs to take a long-term
approach and reflect on the implications of disestablishing
entire academic programmes and courses,” he said. </p><p>“If
Canterbury it is to maintain a position as a leading and
academically vibrant university, then senior management need
to inspire funding reforms both locally and nationally
rather than simply balance the
books.”</p><p>ENDS<br>
