<p>Media Release – 29
January 2008 - For Immediate Use</p>

<p>Asian president committed
to allowances</p>

<p>As the University of Auckland celebrates its
Jubilee in 2008, the Auckland University Students’
Association has also hit a landmark of its own.</p>

<p>2008
President David Do is AUSA’s first president of Asian
descent, the first in the Association’s 117-year
history.</p>

<p>“I’m passionate about serving students, and
I’m proud to take on this important role. I’ll be
working as hard as I can to serve students,” says David
Do.</p>

<p>David comes into the role of President with
considerable experience in the Association executive. He was
Welfare Officer from late 2004 to 2006, running the foodbank
and financial assistance scheme. As 2007 Education Vice
President he was closely involved in fighting the University
of Auckland’s moves to eliminate open entry.</p>

<p>One of
AUSA’s key priorities for 2008 is campaigning to increase
access to student allowances.</p>

<p>“Students should not be
forced to borrow to live because their parents are ‘too
rich’ or because they’re under 25. I think that’s
wrong – students should be properly supported while they
are studying,” says David Do.</p>

<p>“The facts are clear
about skyrocketing student debt, and students are angry
about this continued lack of proper support. We saw this
clearly from the New Zealand Union of Students’
Associations conference in Wellington this past weekend.”<p>

<p>AUSA is fully committed to the nationwide campaign for
living allowances for all students.</p>
