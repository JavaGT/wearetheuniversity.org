<p>Media Release – 25 July 2008 – For Immediate
Use</p>

<p><b>AUSA to lodge police complaint over Rice
visit</b></p>

<p>Representatives of the Auckland University
Students’ Association (AUSA) will lodge a formal complaint
over United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at
the Auckland Central Police station at 2.30pm this
afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday AUSA offered any Auckland University
student a $5000 reward if they are able to make a successful
citizen's arrest of United States Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice during her visit to Auckland this weekend,
for her role in overseeing the illegal invasion and
continued occupation of Iraq.</p>

<p>“While we still hope an
Auckland University student might be able to make a
successful citizen’s arrest of Rice, we are also pursuing
official channels available to us to have this war criminal
arrested,” said AUSA President David Do.</p>

<p>“Student
associations in New Zealand have a long history of being
involved in fighting for global justice, dating back to
student involvement in the 1981 anti-Springbok tour protests
and the US war in Indochina in the 1960s and 1970s. By
opposing Rice’s visit and seeking her arrest we seek to
continue that proud tradition,” says David Do.</p>

<p>“We
believe that Rice’s involvement in the authorisation of
the torture of suspected terrorists is a crime under two
separate New Zealand statutes, the Geneva Conventions Act
1958 and the Crimes of Torture Act 1989*, and are asking the
New Zealand Police to arrest and prosecute Rice for her
involvement in these crimes,” says AUSA International
Affairs Officer Omar Hamed.<p>
<p>“Rice’s authorisation of
the use of physical torture of suspected terrorists
including simulated drowning (waterboarding) and physical
assaults would make Rice liable to be prosecuted and
sentenced to up to fourteen years under New Zealand law. We
hope the Police act swiftly to bring to justice someone
whose crimes stretch across oceans,” concluded Mr Hamed.<p>
