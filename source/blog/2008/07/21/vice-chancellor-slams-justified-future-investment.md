<p>Vice-Chancellor slams justified future
investment, Auckland students beg to differ</p>

<p>Students at
the University of Auckland return to classes tomorrow,
disappointed that their Vice-Chancellor appears out of touch
with their financial situation and dismissive of moves to
improve it.</p>

<p>University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Stuart
McCutcheon said Friday that the universal student allowance
being contemplated by the Government would amount to "an
unjustified election bribe," adding that the money spent on
student allowances should be spent instead on
universities.</p>

<p>“We agree universities need to be properly
funded to ensure high quality education for all, but what is
the use of world-class facilities and well-paid lecturers if
the students being taught are too hungry and tired to learn?
It is insulting to describe moves to ensure all students are
properly supported throughout their studies as merely an
‘unjustified election bribe’,” says AUSA President
David Do.</p>

<p>“A universal student allowance is a justified
future investment that would enhance student retention and
completion rates, allow them to achieve their full
potential, and retain our skilled graduates in New Zealand.
The cost pales in comparison with the real election bribes
of the season – tax cuts,” he adds.</p>

<p>The scheme’s
estimated cost of $728 million (over four years) is modest
compared to the $10 billion of student debt currently
carried by New Zealand’s children and grandchildren. It is
also approximately one fifteenth of the $10.6 billion
estimated cost of tax cuts (over four years) already
announced by the Government, and would be an even smaller
fraction if the National Party proposes larger tax
cuts.<p>
<p>Students clearly support a universal student
allowance. The 2007 NZUSA Income and Expenditure Survey (a
comprehensive survey of students and their finances) found
that a high proportion of domestic tertiary students agreed
that a living allowance should be provided to all full-time
students (79%).</p>

<p>The Auckland University Students
Association has campaigned hard along with other student
associations nationwide to ensure more students are properly
supported while they are studying. AUSA calls on Stuart
McCutcheon to front up and directly explain to students why
he believes better support for them is
“unjustified."</p>
