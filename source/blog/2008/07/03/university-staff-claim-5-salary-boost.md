<p>Combined University Unions</p>

<p>Media Release</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>University staff claim $5,000 salary
boost</p>

<p>University staff will open employment agreement
negotiations next week with a claim for a $5,000 increase to
all salary rates. The flat rate, rather than a percentage
increase claim, is intended to give a proportionally greater
increase to lower-paid university staff, including most of
the general staff (or non-academic) classifications.</p>

<p>The
salary claim is in addition to $15 million of funding
provided by the government to be allocated on the basis of a
1.53% increase for academic staff and 0.51% increase for
general staff, effective from 1 July.</p>

<p>Eight unions will be
represented in the negotiations as well as the country’s
eight university vice-chancellors.</p>

<p>The combined unions’
lead advocate, Marty Braithwaite, said that, while much had
been documented over the last few years about the low state
of academic salaries, general staff salaries also need a
significant boost. “Department of Labour figures show that
technicians and associated professionals, who comprise a
significant proportion of university general staff, are on
its ‘severe shortages’ list, as are most trades
groups,” he said. “Similarly, between 2006 and 2007, the
Department of Labour reported that the shortage rate for
skilled clerical and administrative staff, another group
highly represented in universities, became much
worse.”<p>
<p>Mr Braithwaite added that, with skill shortages
expected to remain at high levels in the medium-term and
with significant increases in the cost of living, there will
continue be upward pressure on salaries in the foreseeable
future.</p>

<p>The unions are also seeking two, new national
multi-employer collective employment agreements to replace
the more than fourteen collective agreements currently
negotiated at individual universities. “Such agreements
will provide a platform for the unions and vice-chancellors
to address national salary problems in the university sector
in a strategic manner, and allow for a common approach to
long-term workforce planning,” Mr Braithwaite
said.</p>
