	 <p>
         24 July 2008 </p><p>AUSA offers $5000 for citizen's arrest of
Rice</p><p> Auckland students seek the arrest of a high-level
United States official visiting Auckland this weekend. New
Zealand's largest students' association has offered any
Auckland University student a $5000 reward if they are able
to make a successful citizen's arrest of United States
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit to
Auckland over the weekend, for her role in overseeing the
illegal invasion and continued occupation of Iraq.</p><p> "It is
hard enough living as a student in Auckland these days
without having a war criminal coming to town, so we thought
we'd give our students a chance to make a dent in their
student loans and work for global justice at the same time",
says AUSA President David Do.</p><p> The invasion and occupation
of Iraq was overseen by Condoleeza Rice and other US
officials in her role as National Security Advisor and later
Secretary of State (equivalent to Minister of Foreign
Affairs).</p><p> “Generally when US officials visit overseas
they are heavily shielded from the general public, and
unfortunately its not hard to see why,” adds David Do.</p><p>
"Rice is the public spokesperson for an illegal and immoral
occupation that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths
and the continued oppression of the people of Iraq. We
believe Rice should be arrested and detained in accordance
with the law and tried fairly at the International Criminal
Court for her role in these war crimes," said AUSA
International Affairs Officer Omar Hamed, who moved the
motion for the reward at Monday’s AUSA Executive
meeting.
