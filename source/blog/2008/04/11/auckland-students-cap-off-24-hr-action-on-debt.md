<p><b> Auckland students cap off 24-hr action on student
debt</b></p>

<p>Auckland University students have successfully
completed their 24-hour debt ghetto to commiserate student
debt hitting $10 billion yesterday.<p>

<p>Students lived in
cardboard box structures in the Quad during the day and
overnight, to visualise student poverty and the burden many
students face through high living costs and borrowing to
live.</p>

<p>“Students have shown through their significant
time commitment that they are deeply concerned about the
growing burden of student debt they have to face,” says
AUSA President David Do.<p>

<p>“People got so worked up about
one Eden Park or one waterfront stadium - $10 billion is the
same as redeveloping Eden Park 42 times! We should be angry
about the 42 Eden Parks we are loading onto our children and
grandchildren,” he adds.</p>

<p>The Quad was transformed into a
wonderfully creative ‘Box City’ of cardboard castles,
forts, mounds, and structures. They sent a strong visual and
powerful message to students and staff who attended the
action. Contrary to popular belief, students were tidy and
well-behaved, and cleaned up in the Quad in good time this
morning.</p>

<p>AUSA is disappointed that the government ruling
out a universal allowance for students.<p>

<p>“If the
government is focusing on ‘economic transformation’ and
‘families young and old’, then that means properly
supporting students by returning to a universal allowance
for all students,” Do concludes.</p>

<p>[Note: Photos will be
available from the President later
today]</p>
