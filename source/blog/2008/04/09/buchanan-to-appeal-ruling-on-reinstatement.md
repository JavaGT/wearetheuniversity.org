         Buchanan to appeal ruling on reinstatement </p><p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has confirmed that an
appeal will be filed in the Employment Court on behalf of Dr
Paul Buchanan, claming that he should be reinstated to his
position as a senior lecturer at the University of
Auckland.</p><p>The Employment Relations Authority recently
ruled that Dr Buchanan had been unjustifiably dismissed from
his employment at the University, but it declined to
reinstate him. Dr Buchanan was awarded more than $65,000 in
lost wages and compensation.</p><p>The university summarily
sacked Dr Buchanan in July last year on the grounds of
serious misconduct after sending what was described in the
media as an angry email to a student, a United Arab Emirates
national. In the email, which was widely reprinted, Dr
Buchanan spoke bluntly of the student’s very weak academic
performance and lack of aptitude for graduate study and said
that he did not believe her excuse for not delivering her
final assignment on the due date.</p><p>AUS deputy secretary
Marty Braithwaite said that reinstatement was the primary
remedy where dismissal was found to be unjustified and this
was an important issue for Dr Buchanan, particularly given
that the effect of the loss of his job effectively ended his
academic career in New Zealand.</p><p>It is not known at this
stage when an appeal will be
heard.</p><p>ENDS
