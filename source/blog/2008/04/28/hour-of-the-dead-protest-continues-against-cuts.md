<p><br>Hour of the dead carnival as protest
continues against ongoing cuts to core staff at University
of Canterbury</p>

<p>Ceremonial executions and amputations will
be held at the University of Canterbury this week to
symbolise the impending death of arts as the university
moves ahead with plans to restructure its College of Arts
with the loss of thirteen jobs, and to act as a fund raiser
for the perpetually cash-strapped university.</p>

<p>An Hour of
the Dead carnival will be held at the central library steps
on Wednesday, 30 April from 12.30pm. The central attraction
will be a life-sized guillotine and ceremonial executions
from 1.00pm.</p>

<p>Staff and students will be invited to pay to
have body-parts removed by professional executioners with
the proceeds donated back to the university to stave off the
axing of jobs. Suggested donations are $50 for a foot or
hand and $20 for a head. “Heads are cheaper,” according
to Association of University Staff Canterbury Branch
President, Professor Jack Heinemann, “because then we save
on salaries too.”</p>

<p>Professor Heinemann says that students
and staff have vowed to continue the fight against the cuts
to the College of Arts. “University management will argue
that this change is financially necessary and that overall
it will have a limited impact on students and staff,” he
said. “We believe instead that this is a symptom of skewed
priorities that are not being adequately reviewed by
Academic Board and the Council.”<p>
