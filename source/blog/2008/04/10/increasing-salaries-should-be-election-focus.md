<p><br>Increasing salaries should be
election focus</p>

<p>Increasing wages and salaries in New
Zealand should be a major focus of debate in election year
rather than lowering taxes and cutting government spending,
according to the Association of University Staff (AUS). It
says that the current debate on tax cuts is too narrow and
that it would be more productive to concentrate on lifting
wages and salaries to levels comparable to those in
Australia and other countries with which New Zealand
competes for labour.</p>

<p>University staff are voting this week
to decide whether to initiate bargaining for national
collective employment agreements as one measure to try and
address international salary disparities. The national
agreements would replace current enterprise-based ones,
negotiated separately at each university.</p>

<p>AUS national
president, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, said that
New Zealand weekly wages in 2007 averaged around $731.04,
compared with the $NZ1029.26 in Australia. “Such a
significant difference in the spending power of New Zealand
workers will not be addressed by tax cuts of between $15 and
$20 a week; it is up to employers to lift their game and
substantially increase wage levels,” she said. “During
the era of the Employment Contracts Act, New Zealand wage
and salary levels dropped from being broadly equivalent to
those in Australia to being around 30 percent
behind.”<p>
<p>Associate Professor Montgomery said it is
ironic that there are a large number of Australian companies
in New Zealand paying their workers significantly less than
their Australian counterparts, while at the same time taking
huge profits out of the country. “Higher levels of
productivity have been used as a justification for higher
wages in Australia, but we do not accept that New Zealand
workers are generally any less skilled or hard-working than
their Australian counterparts,” she said.</p>

<p>New Zealand
universities recruit more than 50 percent of staff from the
international market, yet salaries remain as much as 25
percent behind Australia, even when adjusted for cost of
living.</p>
