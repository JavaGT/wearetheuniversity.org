         <b> Green light for national salary bargaining in
universities</b></p><p>Members of the major unions representing
staff in New Zealand’s universities have voted
overwhelmingly to support the negotiation of national
collective employment agreements in the next bargaining
round. A ballot, conducted on a university-by-university
basis, has endorsed a recommendation by the unions to move
from enterprise-based bargaining at each university to the
negotiation of one national collective agreement for
academic staff and another for general staff. </p><p>More than
95 percent (1906) of the 1993 academic staff that
participated in the ballot voted in support of the proposal,
and 94 percent (1802) of the 1907 general staff also voted
to support national bargaining.  The result means that
bargaining with the universities will be initiated in April
and it is expected that formal negotiations will commence in
May. </p><p>Combined unions’ spokesperson, Marty Braithwaite,
said he was pleased with the result as, following last
year’s negotiations, the unions have been engaged in a
tripartite process with the Government and vice-chancellors
to find solutions to long-standing funding and salary
problems facing the university sector. “The high number of
union members voting in this ballot, along with the high
level of support for national bargaining, has given us a
very clear mandate to continue this process with university
employers,” he said. “It also shows that university
staff appreciate the link between funding and salaries, and
support the view that the best means to improve salaries is
through a national collective bargaining process.”

<p>Mr
Braithwaite said that the unions’ position would be
strengthened by the inclusion of AUT and that he expected
university employers to support the decision of union
members and recognise that the salary crisis in the sector
was an issue that would only be resolved on a national
basis, and with the co-operation of university employers,
unions and the Government. “We are providing the
vice-chancellors with the mechanism of national collective
employment agreements to make this happen,” he
said.</p><p>Unions participating in the process include the
Association of University Staff (AUS), the Association of
Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE), the Public Service
Association (PSA) the Tertiary Institutes’ Allied Staff
Association (TIASA), the New Zealand Building Trades Union,
the Amalgamated Workers union and the Engineering, Printing
and Manufacturing Union
(EPMU).</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
