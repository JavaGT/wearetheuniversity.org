<p><b> University confused, says staff</b></p>

<p>Proposals released
today to cut thirteen jobs from the University of
Canterbury’s College of Arts shows just how confused
management is when it comes to running a university,
according to the Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>In
response to the 340 submissions it received on proposed
changes to the college, the university has tempered plans to
completely axe its American Studies and Theatre and Film
Studies programmes and now intends to resubmit to staff for
further consultation two different models for a new college
structure.</p>

<p>The decision, announced by the pro
vice-chancellor for Arts, was that American Studies would be
retained, but with the loss of 4.5 staff.  It is proposed
that the programme be taught by three full-time staff,
giving the programme a staff to student ratio of 1 to 45.3,
which is fifty percent higher than the highest student to
staff ratio in an existing programme in the college.<p>

<p>Meanwhile Theatre and Films Studies will become two
separate programmes located in different schools within the
college, with the loss of one technical position.  Film
production will no longer be part of that particular
programme of study.  The new proposal was never discussed
with the Head of Theatre and Film Studies and, according to
a number of affected staff and students, makes almost as
little sense as the plan to axe the whole programme.  This
begs the question whether the Vice-Chancellor has fulfilled
his contractual obligation to staff which requires that
there be an attempt to reach agreement over any planned
changes.<p>
<p>Both models for a new college structure involve
considerable disruption and uncertainty for the
administrative staff.  While fewer job losses will be
incurred, the implementation of the new structure will not
be finalised until the second half of the year.  AUS
National President, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery,
commented that the proposed changes did not take into
account or sufficiently value the specific skills and
institutional knowledge that administrative staff have and
said that they “cannot simply be moved around a draught
board like chequers.”<p>

<p>Associate Professor Montgomery
expressed deep concern about the long-term sustainability of
the College of Arts, with the proposal to have larger
classes, a high staff to student ratio, further savings to
be made from staff attrition, and ongoing fiscal constraints
to the operational budgets of schools within the college.  
“This plan does not offer long-term stability to the
College of Arts and there needs to be an urgent national
debate as to what kind of university we want for New Zealand
because at this rate even History will be history,” she
said.</p>
