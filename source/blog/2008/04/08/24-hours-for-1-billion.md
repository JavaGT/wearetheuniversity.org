<p>Media Release - 8 April 2008 - For Immediate Use</p>

<p>24 hours
for $10 Billion</p>

<p>Auckland students will be commiserating as
student debt hits $10 billion this Thursday. That’s equal
to redeveloping Eden Park 42 times! AUSA is having a ‘debt
ghetto’ in its Quad from 10am this Thursday going
overnight to 10am April 11, which will involve students
sleeping over in a cardboard 'box city' in the
Quad.</p>

<p>“Our ‘debt ghetto’ visually symbolises student
poverty and the burden that many students face through high
living costs and borrowing to live,” says David Do, AUSA
President.</p>

<p>“A continued lack of access to student
allowances and rising tuition fees mean debt is continuing
to rise to unacceptable levels. Given the way the cost of
living is going, maybe all we can afford when we graduate is
boxes!”</p>

<p>“$10 billion dollars of student debt in New
Zealand is simply wrong. We call on the Government to lower
the age of parental means testing to 20 in its upcoming
Budget, to ensure that more students are properly supported
while they are studying,” says Sophia Blair, AUSA
Education Vice President.</p>

<p>10 Billion Day will feature
veteran campaigner John Minto as keynote speaker at 12 noon,
followed at 1pm by a political debate organised by the
Debating Club on the issue of student debt.</p>

<p>There’s also
a free BBQ, as well as an evening soup kitchen and breakfast
the next morning for the hardy souls who stay
overnight.</p>
