<p>THE AUCKLAND UNI ERSITY STUDENTS' ASSOCIATION (INC.)  TE
ROOPU TAUIRA O TE WHARE WAANANGA O TAMAKI MAKAURAU<p>

Media Release – 1 April 2008 – For Immediate Use<p>

<p>Student union takes urgent action to stop student debt
rising<p>

<p>In a bid to head off rising student debt at the
University of Auckland, the AUSA executive voted at its
executive meeting tonight to sell off sponsorship and naming
rights to the Association's Student Union Buildings and
Executive positions, to help stem the tide of student debt,
due to hit $10 billion on April 10.</p>

<p>"We are deeply
concerned about the burden of debt our students will carry
when they graduate, and that underlies the Executive's grave
decision tonight," says AUSA President David Do.</p>

<p>"The
government's failure to properly support students means we
have no choice but to sacrifice ourselves to help our
students."</p>

<p>"The University has also consistently failed to
give students breathing room in its heady race to raise
tuition fees every year. We therefore resolved to sell all
our assets in a selfless move to provide relief for all our
students for at least a year," says AUSA Education Vice
President Sophia Blair.</p>

<p>The total value of the naming
rights is estimated at many millions of dollars. Once sold,
the 20,000 members of AUSA will get approximately thousands
of dollars of debt relief each. AUSA will arrange with
student loan holders for direct repayment to
Studylink.</p>

<p>Naming rights will also be sold to maximise all
possible recovery value. AUSA is currently in talks with
Owen G Glenn regarding possible naming rights to the Student
Union Buildings, and with Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon
on renaming Rudman Gardens to McCutcheon Plaza (like John
Hood Plaza at the Business School, this plaza also comes
with grass). AUSA’s Womenspace room will become the
Maybelline Womenspace - the room's new slogan is 'Maybe its
Womenspace, Maybe its Maybelline!’<p>
<p>Sponsorship deals
finalised tonight for AUSA officers include: •the
Fairfax Media Officer •the Bear Stearns Treasurer
•the Nike Sports Officer •the Solid Energy
Environmental Affairs Officer •the Wattie’s Welfare
Officer</p>

<p>AUSA is also pleased to announce a new on-campus
collaboration with SkyCity Casinos. The profits from a new
'SkyCity Student Express' outlet with pokie machines will be
reinvested back into what remains of the student
community.</p>
