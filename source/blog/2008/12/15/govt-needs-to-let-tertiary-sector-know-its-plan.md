<p>Media Release<p>

<p>15 December 2008<p>

<p>Govt needs to let
tertiary education sector know its plan</p>

<p>News that the
government is undecided about whether to cut costs in the
Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) does not allow tertiary
institutions to plan cohesively.  The newly formed Tertiary
Education Union (TEU) believes the government needs to be
clear about its tertiary education vision and thereby allow
institutions to plan for the future.</p>

<p>“Tertiary education
institutions shouldn’t be competing against each other
over the same students,” said one of the TEU transitional
presidents, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery.  “The
message of cooperating for the good of the communities and
the economy was finally getting through.  But as
institutions watch the TEC wriggle and writhe under the
government’s suspended scalpel they are tempted to revert
back to their old ways.”</p>

<p>“We saw that last week with
the TEC’s permission being given to AUT to establish
another law school in Auckland.”</p>

<p>“The government needs
to stop complaining about the TEC’s bureaucratic costs and
say what it thinks about TEC’s actual purpose in shaping
the sector.”</p>

<p>“No matter what one thinks about the
TEC’s budget, its actual cost is a small proportion of the
tertiary education spend.  The real question we need
answered is does this government see a role for TEC at all,
and, if not, what is its alternative.”</p>
