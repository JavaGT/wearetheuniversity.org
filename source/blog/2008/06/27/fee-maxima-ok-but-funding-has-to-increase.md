<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Release</p>

<p>Fee maxima OK, but university funding has to
increase</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has
welcomed a proposal from the government that the maximum
amount by which tertiary student fees can be increased for
2009 will be 2.6 percent, but warns that the government must
act now to increase funding to the university sector.</p>

<p>AUS
academic vice-president, Dr Grant Duncan, said that, while
it is highly desirable the cost of tertiary education be
kept as low as possible for students, a consequence is that
additional government funding is urgently required to
maintain the high quality and good reputation of the New
Zealand university system.</p>

<p>Dr Duncan said that the cost of
running universities had increased at a rate at least 1.6
times higher than the general rate of inflation for the
economy as a whole, but that university income had fallen in
real terms by over $20 million per year over the last six
years.<p>

<p>“Although it has been acknowledged by university
management, government and unions that salaries in the
university sector are low, efforts to alleviate this through
additional funding for salaries had to some extent been
undermined by a failure of government to allow for the true
costs of running universities,” Dr Duncan said.
“According to research by the University of Auckland, New
Zealand university income was, in 2006, $2,146 per student
or $223 million in total lower than it would have been if
income had been indexed to rises in university costs since
1991.”</p>

<p>Dr Duncan said that the effects of this
underfunding will be compounded by the fact that annual
salary increases are due, with salary bargaining for the
university sector to occur during
July.</p>
