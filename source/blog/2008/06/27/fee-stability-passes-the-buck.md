<p>Media Release - 27 June 2008 - For Immediate Use</p>

<p>Fee
‘stability’ passes the buck</p>

<p>Auckland students are
likely to be hit hardest by proposed tuition fee maxima
increases announced today.<p>

<p>The Government announced that
the Fee and Course Cost Maxima rate (FCCM – the absolute
maximum tuition fee that can be charged on a particular
subject or course) will increase by 2.6% for
2009.</p>

<p>“We’re especially concerned because tuition fees
at the University of Auckland are amongst the highest in the
country, with most courses already at the absolute maximum
fee limit. Some 38,000 Auckland students are likely to take
most of the brunt,” says AUSA President David Do.</p>

<p>“The
Government has once again passed the buck when it comes to
how to stop burdening students, graduates, and their
families with over $10 billion in student debt.”<p>

<p>“If
‘stability’ means ‘more of the same’, then that’s
simply not good enough,” Do
concludes.</p>
