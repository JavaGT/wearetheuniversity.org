23 June 2008</p><p>27 positions to be axed from Wellington
College of Education </p><p>The Association of University Staff
(AUS) says it is very disappointed that Victoria University
plans to cut twenty-two academic and advisory and seven
administrative positions from its College of Education by
the end of this year. </p><p>Despite receiving 204 submissions
from staff and students largely opposed to the cuts, the
university announced today that cuts will proceed without
any adjustment to its original proposal.</p><p>“We are not
sure how 204 submissions can fail to have any impact on the
number of proposed job loses when that number was certainly
the result of some arbitrary assumptions,”AUS organiser
Michael Gilchrist said today. “This outcome heightens our
concerns about the university’s change processes. We
believe that there should have been broader input on the
decision panel. </p><p>“And now we believe it is vital that an
observer nominated by staff be included on that panel when
its members select who stays in employment and who is made
redundant.  </p><p>“Staff deserve at least that degree of
assurance about the objectivity and impartiality of the
process. However, we have so far encountered a staunch
refusal from the university to make this process more open
and transparent,” Mr Gilchrist said.</p><p>Commenting on the
proposal to cut jobs to bring the College within budget, Mr
Gilchrist blamed both the government and the university.

<p>“The Government has effectively reduced the funding for
teacher education by shifting resources toward research and
away from teaching. </p><p>“But while the university continues
to balance its books with such enthusiasm the pressures on
quality teacher education caused by funding reductions will
not be felt by government.</p><p>“We have faith in our
members, who will continue to work to deliver the very best
education for students at the college - but they deserve
more support.” Mr Gilchrist
concluded.</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
