	 <p>
         26 June 2008</p><p>Academics retain visa-free access to UK</p><p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed
confirmation today that academic staff will continue to have
visa-free access to the United Kingdom for periods of up to
twelve months.</p><p>The British Government has been considering
reducing the period of visa-free entry to the UK from twelve
to three months for academic visitors and from six to three
months for tourists and business visitors. However, the
British Home Office has now confirmed that the current
visa-free access provisions will remain following
representations to the British Government by New Zealand’s
prime minster, Helen Clark. </p><p>Advice that the visa-free
period will remain untouched came after personal discussions
between Helen Clark and her British counterpart, Gordon
Brown, and a formal submission to the Home Office about the
importance of the visa-free arrangements which argued that
the retention of the twelve-month special provision was
important for New Zealand university staff as many viewed
Britain as a destination of choice for study leave.</p><p>AUS
academic vice-president, Dr Grant Duncan, said that
visa-free access to the UK was imperative as many New
Zealand academics are heavily engaged in research
collaboration with British colleagues and see great benefit
in being able to study and to research at some of the
world’s best universities.  </p><p>“Academic staff work in a
highly mobile international market, and the free exchange of
academics among countries is necessary in order to advance
research and knowledge globally,” Dr Duncan said.  “Any
moves to make it more difficult for New Zealand academics to
enter Britain would not only have been unnecessarily
bureaucratic, but they would also have been be
counter-productive because they would have impeded
collaboration on internationally important research between
New Zealand and British academics.”</p><p>Dr Duncan said that
it appeared the motivation for the planned changes came from
the fear of an increased number of illegal immigrants to
Britain, but there was no evidence to suggest that New
Zealand academics posed any sort of risk.
