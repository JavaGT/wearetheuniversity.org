<p>College Staff take action against job
cuts</p>

<p><br>Staff at Victoria University’s College of
Education have begun legal and protest action to force the
college to halt forced redundancies and undertake a fair and
objective review of its activities.<p>

<p>The action follows an
announcement last Friday that the College proposed to
disestablish 18 jobs. 17 voluntary redundancies have already
been made at the College in July this year with the PVC
Education, Prof. Dugald Scott, advising staff at the time
that there would be no need for any forced redundancies.
Several days prior to the announcement of the proposal to
cut 18 jobs, 18 staff were surprised to discover that they
had little or no teaching workload allocated to them for
2009 – from which they began to infer that their jobs
might be at risk.<p>

<p>“Even by the standards of recent
changes at the college, this process represents an
astonishing and quite cruel disconnection between the
activities of management and the working life of staff. It
is also a flagrant breach of management obligations around
information, consultation and fairness,” senior staff
member, Dr Joanna Kidman, said.<p>

<p>“While 18 people appear
to have been targeted in a completely opaque  process, the
staff as a whole are saying that they cannot continue to
work with any sort of dignity or efficacy in this
environment. We don’t know who will be struck down next or
for what reason. We have no idea what the financial or
academic plan for the college is.<p>
<p>“Bizarrely, the week
before the announcement the Director of the College was
still actively reproaching staff for listening to rumours of
job losses.</p>

<p>“We are also very concerned about the
continuing quality of teacher education at the college. For
example, face to face hours between lecturers and student
teachers have been cut by more than half - from 66 hours to
25 in English, say, or 58 to 25 in Maths.</p>

<p>“Staff have
decided to take a range of protest action including an
“information boycott”. Since information provided by
staff appears to have been used to target individuals for
redundancies without them knowing it would be used for this
purpose, we will not be providing any more information until
we have some assurances that there will be no forced
redundancies and a fair and objective review will be
undertaken.</p>
