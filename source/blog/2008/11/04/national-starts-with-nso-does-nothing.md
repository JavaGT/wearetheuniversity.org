	 <p>
         www.ausa.auckland.ac.nz</p><p>Media Release – 4 November 2008
– For Immediate Use</p><p>'National' starts with 'N'...so does
'Nothing'</p><p>Students are highly critical of Nationals
surrender on student support yesterday. The National Party
has said it is unlikely to make an announcement about its
student allowances policy before the election, instead
hinting at changes in the 2009 Budget if elected.</p><p>National
Party spokespeople have repeatedly stated to students at
various debates over the past year that National's tertiary
education policies were yet to be finalised and would be
announced closer to the election. In response to Labour's
universal allowance announcement three weeks ago, National
said they would announce a more generous scheme but that it
won't be universal. </p><p>“Yesterday's news shows their past
statements to be disingenuous and reveals a policy vacuum in
this economically and socially significant policy area.
Political parties are supposed to bring their policies to
the electorate before polling day - not make them up
afterwards. This is simply unacceptable,” says AUSA
President David Do.</p><p>“On the issue of tertiary education,
National appears bereft of ideas – delivering nothing to
address students' financial situations, and nothing to
address underfunding of universities and polytechnics,” he
says.</p><p>Students are also worried about what National might
do to tertiary education if it is elected into
office.</p><p>“In the 1990 election, Lockwood Smith promised
to resign if National did not abolish tertiary fees if
elected into office. Neither occurred. Can National really
be trusted on tertiary education?,” concludes
Do.

<p>National's student loan bonding policies show that the
party acknowledges that student debt ($10 billion and
rising) is problematic because it helps drive young
graduates offshore. AUSA wonders why it won't make a bold
commitment to stop this debt accumulating in the first
place.</p><p>AUSA calls on the National Party to be transparent
with the public and release its tertiary education policy
before the
election.</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
