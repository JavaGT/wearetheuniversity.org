<p>Vice Chancellors have right problem but wrong plan<br>MEDIA
RELEASE<br>27 November 2008<br>Attention: all education
reporters</p>

<p>The New Zealand Vice Chancellors’
Committee’s  (NZVCC) 9 point plan for university
education, which was released yesterday, is blinkered and
would be doomed to fail, according to one of the
transitional presidents of the Tertiary Education Union
(TEU), Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery. “The NZVCC
has correctly identified the problem that universities face,
underfunding, but its solution to take money from other
areas that are also underfunded, such as students and the
rest of the tertiary sector is iniquitous,” she
said.</p>

<p>The vice-chancellors’ plan would see higher fees
coupled with less financial support for students, and a
transfer of funding from other institutions, such as
Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics, to Universities;
something which appears to signal a desire to return to a
more competitive, less structured model for tertiary
education.</p>

<p>The newly formed TEU, which represents workers
in the entire tertiary education sector, including
university staff, says that tertiary education needs an
integrated strategy to resolve systematic underfunding, not
just the first-in-first-served approach that the NZVCC has
proposed.</p>

<p>“It is not just universities that are a key
part of the nation’s infrastructure, as the NZVCC claims,
but public education as a whole.  University vice
chancellors will not be seen to speak for the whole sector
when they take a narrow and segmented view of our education
system.”</p>
