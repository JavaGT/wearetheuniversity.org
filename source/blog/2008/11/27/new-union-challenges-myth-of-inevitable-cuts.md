<p>_MEDIA RELEASE<br>New tertiary education union challenges
myth of inevitable cuts<br>26 November 2008<br>Attention:
all education reporters</p>

<p>The newly formed Tertiary
Education Union (TEU) is challenging the myth that a global
economic crisis and a new conservative government will mean
cuts to public tertiary education.</p>

<p>“We Kiwis cannot
protect ourselves from an impending economic storm by
cutting down public education,” says Tangi Tipene, TEU
Co-President. “If we are to survive the oncoming economic
bad weather we need to invest in teaching quality, research,
and accessibility. All New Zealanders need the opportunities
that tertiary education can provide to weather the storm.”<p>

<p>TEU responded quickly to the challenge the Tertiary
Education Commission’s chief executive, Professor Roy
Sharp, laid down to it at its inaugural conference
yesterday.  Professor Sharp argued that the current economic
environment means there will be no real extra money to go
around and that institutions will need to get by on current
budgets.</p>

<p>“Tertiary education is struggling from years of
underfunding already,” says TEU Co-President, Associate
Professor Maureen Montgomery. “Capping existing budgets in
the face of current high inflation is effectively a cut. The
new minister of tertiary education needs to act quickly to
stem the economic crisis by investing in public services
that can shelter us from this mess.”</p>

<p>“It is crucial
that we see public education not as a cost to be trimmed but
as a tool to solve the problem,” Dr Montgomery
added.</p>
