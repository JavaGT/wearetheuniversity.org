<p>New tertiary - education union another
step closer</p>

<p>The formation of a new union in the
tertiary-education sector has moved a step closer with the
adoption of a set of draft rules by representatives of the
Association of University Staff (AUS) and Association of
Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE).</p>



<p>The new union, the
New Zealand Tertiary Education Union, to be formed through
the amalgamation of AUS and ASTE, will be the largest union
operating in the tertiary-education sector and will
represent the industrial and professional interests of more
than 11,500 academic and general staff.</p>



<p>Proposed rules
for the new union were adopted at a one-day conference held
in Wellington last Friday, following a meeting the day
before between the council and national executive of the two
existing unions to advance a number of operational matters
arising from the amalgamation.</p>



<p>AUS national president,
Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, and ASTE national
president, Tangi Tipene, said that the successful adoption
of proposed rules for the union reflected how well AUS and
ASTE had worked together to create an new, democratic union
which would advance the industrial and professional
interests of tertiary-education staff throughout the
country. "This is an historic occasion and makes the new
organisation among the largest unions in the country," they
said. "This amalgamation will not only increase the
influence of staff within the tertiary-education sector
through building industrial strength and advancing
professional and education issues, but it will also ensure
the better use of resources."  Both national presidents were
pleased that member participation was positive and many felt
the unions had already amalgamated.</p>



<p>The New Zealand
Tertiary Education Union will hold its inaugural conference
in late November and become fully operational on 1 January
2009.</p>
