<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Release</p>

<p>Attn

<p>AUS welcomes PBRF report’s release</p>

<p>The
Association of University Staff welcomes the release today
of the Adams Report commissioned by the Tertiary Education
Commission to review the Performance-Based research Fund.
The report was produced by Dr Jonathan Adams of Evidence
Limited, a UK-based research company.  Earlier this year, Dr
Adams spent some weeks in New Zealand meeting staff and
managers of tertiary-education institutions and collecting
data by means of consultations, interviews, and focus
groups.</p>

<p>AUS national president, Associate Professor
Maureen Montgomery, acknowledged that the report has covered
many of the issues of concern that the union and its members
have raised about the PBRF, and that some of the conclusions
Dr Adams reaches may well cause controversy.  “That Dr
Adams has not hesitated to raise and discuss such a range of
issues in relation to the PBRF confirms for us that this
report is indeed a genuinely independent review, said Dr
Montgomery.  We are particularly pleased to note that issues
such as the reporting of individual scores and the use of
PBRF grades in performance appraisals are considered in the
report.”</p>

<p>Dr Montgomery further observed that, given the
issues Dr Adams has noted in his report, it is AUS’s view
that after the 2012 round the sector needs to find better
solutions for developing sustainable research profiles in
tertiary-education institutions. “In our view,  the PBRF,
as it is currently operating, will make little contribution
to achieving the long-term development of a research culture
in this country.  A move away from the individual unit of
assessment would go some way towards addressing this issue;
other options, however, need to be further explored to
ensure our sector is well-placed to meet the local and
global challenges of sustaining a high-quality research
culture,” Dr Montgomery
concluded.</p>
