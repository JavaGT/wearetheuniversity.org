<p>Media Release - 20 October 2008 - For Immediate
Use</p>

<p>University students seek <br>University’s support
today</p>

<p>Auckland students will seek the University’s
support for a universal student allowance at the
University’s Council meeting this afternoon at 4pm in the
Clocktower.<p>

<p>The two student representatives on Council,
AUSA President David Do and AUSA Education Vice President
Sophia Blair, have put the item on the Council’s agenda to
be discussed and voted on.</p>

<p>“Many students at Auckland
University find themselves in difficult financial
circumstances due to lack of access to student allowances.
Students who are properly supported while they are studying,
not just academically but also financially, are more likely
to achieve their full potential,” says AUSA President
David Do.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education recently found that
those who received student allowances did better
academically and were almost twice more likely to
successfully complete their studies than those who did not
receive similar allowance support. Allowances made the
biggest difference for Maori students, who were three times
more likely to complete their qualification.</p>

<p>“With
government funding becoming increasingly focused on lifting
performance in student retention and completion rates,
tertiary institutions will be better off when more students
get an allowance.”</p>

<p>The item was placed on the Council
agenda two weeks ago, before major political announcements
on the issue.</p>

<p>“We felt the issue would be topical anyway
and should be considered by the Council. We believe that the
University should take a principled position in favour of
properly supporting students through their studies,”
concludes
Do.</p>
