	 <p>
         <br>www.ausa.auckland.ac.nz</p><p>Media Release – 13 October
2008 – For Immediate Use</p><p>Labour joins the top of the
class</p><p>Auckland students welcome Labour's commitment today
to reintroducing a universal student allowance from 2009
onwards. Labour now joins the political and public consensus
that supports a universal student allowance.</p><p>“This is
excellent news for young people, their families, and the
country. A universal student allowance is a justified future
investment in our young people, so they can focus on their
studies and graduate with less debt,” says AUSA President
David Do.</p><p>“While the implementation is not as immediate
as we would have liked, we understand the Government’s
motivation given the current economic situation.
Nevertheless, this is a significant commitment by a major
party to a universal student allowance,” says Do.</p><p>While
students and their families will cast their vote on a
variety of issues, AUSA urges them to consider who is
committed to properly supporting them through their studies
through a universal allowance.</p><p>For those voting on the
allowances issue, they have one more to add to a wide range
of choices. The Green, Maori, United Future, New Zealand
First, Progressive, and Alliance political parties have all
long supported a universal allowance. Labour now joins their
ranks.</p><p>AUSA now looks forward to a truly bipartisan
commitment on student support from the National
Party.</p><p>“National has already matched Labour’s
commitment to no interest on student loans. We look forward
to National now matching today’s announcement with the
same bipartisan commitment to reduce debt on young people
and support people as they grow through higher education,”
says AUSA President David Do.

<p>“The National Party is
well aware of the problems many students and families are
facing.</p><p>Their health workforce policy, which writes off
debt for some doctors and nurses, shows they recognise
student debt as a problem."</p><p>“Both major parties were
responsible for putting in user-pays tertiary education in
the early 1990s – let's hope they both commit to this
major step back in the right direction,” concludes
Do.</p><p>ENDS<!-- LINKS REMOVED
