         www.ausa.auckland.ac.nz</p><p>Media Release - 17 October 2008 -
For Immediate Use</p><p>University students seek University’s
support</p><p>Auckland students will seek the University’s
support for a universal student allowance at the
University’s Council meeting this Monday afternoon.</p><p>The
two student representatives on Council, AUSA President David
Do and AUSA Education Vice President Sophia Blair, have put
the item on the Council’s agenda to be discussed and voted
on.</p><p>“Many students at Auckland University find
themselves in difficult financial circumstances due to lack
of access to student allowances. Students who are properly
supported while they are studying, not just academically but
also financially, are more likely to achieve their full
potential,” says AUSA President David Do.</p><p>The Ministry
of Education recently found that those who received student
allowances did better academically and were almost twice
more likely to successfully complete their studies than
those who did not receive similar allowance support.
Allowances made the biggest difference for Maori students,
who were three times more likely to complete their
qualification.</p><p>“With government funding becoming
increasingly focused on lifting performance in student
retention and completion rates, tertiary institutions will
be better off when more students get an allowance."</p><p>The
item was placed on the Council agenda two weeks ago, before
major political announcements on the issue.</p><p>“We felt the
issue would be topical anyway and should be considered by
the Council.
</p>
<p>We believe that the University should take a
principled position in favour of properly supporting
students through their studies,” concludes Do.</p><p><br>Note:
The resolution is below:</p><p>Moved David Do, seconded Sophia
Blair:</p><p>That the University of Auckland Council,</p><p>1.
recognises that many students face financial difficulties
during their studies due to lack of access to student
allowances, and</p><p>2. recognises that properly supporting
students through their studies yields positive benefits for
students and the institution, and thus</p><p>3. resolves to
support the introduction of a universal student
allowance.</p><p><br>ENDS<br>
