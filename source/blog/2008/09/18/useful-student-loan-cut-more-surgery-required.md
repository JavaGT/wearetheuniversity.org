<p>Media Release - 18 September 2008 - For Immediate Use</p>

<p>A
useful student loan ‘cut’, but more surgery
required</p>

<p>Auckland students believe National’s policy of
wiping some medical students’ loans is a promising step in
the right direction, however caution that the best way
forward is to stop these loans and debt from accumulating in
the first place.</p>

<p>National released a voluntary health
bonding policy today involving student loan wipe-offs for
doctors and nurses who work in hard-to-staff areas.</p>

<p>“We
welcome National’s acknowledgement that student debt is a
huge burden on students, their families, and the country.
Medical students have very high workloads, pay amongst the
highest fees in the country, and barely have any time to
work to support themselves,” says AUSA President David
Do.</p>

<p>The 2005 New Zealand Union of Students Associations’
study ‘Doctors and Debt:<br>The Effect of Student Debt on
New Zealand Doctors,’ found that only 20% of<br>students
received an allowance for the full six years of their MBChB
study.<p>

<p>“Given that many can’t get a student allowance
because of parental means testing up to 25, and are thus
forced to borrow to live, it’s no wonder they graduate
with appallingly high debt and shun lower paid but valued
health fields.”</p>

<p>Two thirds of respondents in the study
also stated they would consider leaving New Zealand within
three years of graduating. The level of debt impacts on the
professions medical graduates enter. Financially
less-rewarding areas like general practice and rural
practice tend to miss out, contributing to sector-wide
shortages of skilled health workers.<p>
<p>“This is the
perfect illustration of why students need to be properly
supported while they are studying. Surely the concept of
being properly supported while they’re studying in a
valuable profession for New Zealand’s future would very
attractive and encourage our young graduates to stay in New
Zealand,” says Do.</p>

<p>AUSA looks forward to National’s
tertiary education policy addressing the problem of student
debt he
allowance.</p>
