<p>Auckland University students look
forward to a spirited campaign</p>

<p>Students at New Zealand’s
largest university are looking forward to a spirited
election campaign of policies and promises, one of the most
contested in recent times.</p>

<p>“While the election date
falls during end of year exams, we will be working hard with
other student associations nationwide and NZUSA to ensure as
many students are enrolled to vote and are informed about
the issues that matter to them,” says AUSA President David
Do.</p>

<p>The election date announcement now clears the way for
the rollout of policy announcements and election
promises.</p>

<p>AUSA believes universal access to a living
student allowance is absolutely essential to fund the future
of this country - investing in New Zealand’s young people
so they don’t graduate with so much debt.</p>

<p>“With a
bipartisan consensus on no-interest on student loans, we
look forward to a bipartisan commitment towards addressing
the drivers of debt. We look forward to policy announcements
from Labour and National that address the drivers of debt
– the lack of access to student allowances, and
continuously rising tuition fees."</p>

<p>“Students and their
families call on both Labour and National to commit to a
universal living allowance for all students,” concludes
AUSA President David
Do.</p>
