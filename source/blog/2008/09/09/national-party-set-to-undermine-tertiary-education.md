<p><br>National party set to undermine public provision
of tertiary education</p>

<p>The National party appears intent on
undermining the provision of public tertiary education, with
a statement yesterday that private training providers should
receive the same level of funding as public-sector
institutions, according to the Association of University
Staff (AUS).</p>

<p></p>

<p>AUS general secretary Nanette Cormack said
that the National party's tertiary-education spokesperson,
Dr Paul Hutchison, has complained that private training
institutions do not receive public funding to provide
real-estate courses where the same or similar courses are
being already being successfully provided by
polytechnics.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ms Cormack said the suggestion from Dr
Hutchison, that public and private tertiary-education
providers should compete for funding to run the same or
similar courses, revealed that the National party, if
elected to government, was on an ideological course to
return the tertiary-education sector to a free-for-all
competitive environment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Considerable time and effort
have been spent over the last few years developing a
tertiary-education strategy that is responsive to the
economic and social goals and needs of the country, and to
ensure that the component parts of the sector complement
rather than unnecessarily compete against each other," Ms
Cormack said.<p>

<p></p>

<p>"Dr Hutchison clearly wants to return to
the uncontrolled, wasteful, and deregulated practices of the
past; that he is championing the public funding of private
real-estate courses, particularly at a time when the
real-estate market has stagnated, simply serves to
illustrate that the National party cares more about its
private-sector friends than in the quality and relevance of
tertiary education," Ms Cormack
concluded.</p>
