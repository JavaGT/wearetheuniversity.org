<p>UK visa restrictions for academics
counterproductive, say university staff</p>

<p>Moves to reduce
the free movement of academics into Britain have been
labeled as counterproductive and unnecessarily restrictive,
according to the Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>At
present, academics can enter Britain for a period of up to
twelve months visa-free, but in proposed widespread changes
to immigration rules, the British government is planning to
limit that period to three months.</p>

<p>AUS national president,
Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, says that academic
staff work in a highly-mobile international market, and the
free exchange of academics between countries is necessary in
order to advance research and the world’s knowledge base.
“Any moves to make it more difficult for New Zealand
academics to enter Britain are not only unnecessarily
bureaucratic, but it would be counter-productive because
they will impede collaboration on internationally important
research between New Zealand and British academics,” she
said.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Montgomery said that
universities recruit as many as 60 percent of new staff from
overseas countries and any restriction on the immigration of
academics would compound a forecast staff recruitment and
retention crisis in British universities by the end of this
decade.</p>

<p>“It appears that the motivation for the planned
changes comes from the fear of an increased number of
illegal immigrants to Britain, but there is no evidence to
suggest that New Zealand academics pose any sort of risk,”
Associate Professor Montgomery said.</p>

<p>The AUS supports
moves by the New Zealand government to oppose the proposed
new immigration
rules.</p>
