<p>19 March 2008</p>

<p>Students vote loudly, and resoundingly, NO
to the elimination of open entry</p>

<p>In their first real
chance to have their say on the issue of open entry,
Auckland students have shown overwhelming opposition to the
elimination of open entry from the University of
Auckland.</p>

<p>AUSA put the item of open entry for discussion
at its Autumn General Meeting for all students this
afternoon. The General Meeting, as well as a referendum, is
constitutionally the highest decisionmaking body of the
Association.</p>

<p>“This was the first real chance for
students to show they feel about eliminating open entry.
They voted overwhelmingly, and loudly, no,” says AUSA
President David Do.</p>

<p>“We’re really pleased about the
mandate students have given us this afternoon. This confirms
the position the Executive has held since November last
year, when the University moved to restrict entry to all
remaining qualifications from 2009,” says AUSA Education
Vice President Sophia Blair. Over 250 students packed the
Quad for the meeting. Hundreds of students voted almost
unanimously for the following motions:</p>

<p>THAT AUSA condemns
the University for its complete failure to adequately
consult and discuss the issues of admissions and limited
entry with its most important stakeholders, students. THAT
AUSA opposes the elimination of open entry from the
University of Auckland.</p>

<p>THAT this General Meeting
supports AUSA, if necessary, undertaking legal action
(through judicial or administrative review, legal
injunction, or equivalent actions) against the University in
order to secure an appropriate process for considering the
issues of student admission and selection, and secure fair
processes of student admission into the University of
Auckland.<p>

<p>Professor Margaret Mutu of the Maori Studies
Department also spoke to the crowd regarding the motions,
saying that the power is in students’ hands on this issue.
“AUSA will act accordingly with the mandate of
students,” says David Do, AUSA President.<p>
