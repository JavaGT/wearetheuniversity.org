<p>Time to review funding
arrangements, say university staff</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inadequate
level of Marsden research funding in New Zealand highlights
the need for major new investment in publicly funded
research, according to the Association of University Staff
(AUS).</p>

<p>More than four hundred scientists and researchers
sent an open letter to the Minister for Science, Technology
and Research this week, asking that the amount of money made
available for research through the Marsden Fund be trebled,
to $120 million, over the next few years. The Fund, which
currently distributes around $40 million annually, is one of
the few New Zealand sources for the funding of undirected
basic research and is well-known internationally for its
high productivity per dollar and its role in value
creation.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Associate Professor
Maureen Montgomery, said that the inadequate level of the
Marsden Fund serves to highlight the broader issue of
funding for research in many sectors, not just within the
sphere of the sciences. “In the tertiary education sector,
AUS has consistently lobbied for levels of support and
funding for research to be increased across all
disciplines,” she said. “The overall objectives for New
Zealand as a country and the tertiary education sector in
particular will, in our view, be difficult to achieve if
they are not sufficient supported to explore new knowledge
areas as well as maintaining and improving upon the success
of current programmes.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Montgomery said
that, while New Zealand research has a significant impact
internationally, only about 10 percent of Marsden
applications received funding and that this was a barrier
particularly to young and emerging
researchers.</p>
