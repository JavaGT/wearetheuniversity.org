	 <p>
         14 March 2008</p><p><br>AUS appointment to PBRF reference
group</p><p>The appointment today of Dr Grant Duncan,
Association of University Staff Academic Vice-President, was
announced today as one of a fifteen-strong Sector Reference
Group created to provide advice to the Tertiary Education
Commission (TEC) on the design, implementation, timing,
nature and conduct of the Performance-Based Research Fund
2012 Quality Evaluation process.</p><p>Dr Duncan, a nominee of
the Association of University Staff (AUS), is a senior
lecturer in Social and Public Policy Programmes at Massey
University, Albany.  His appointment will ensure that the
concerns of university staff about the operation of the PBRF
are considered by the TEC.</p><p>The primary goal of the PBRF is
to distribute the research component of the government grant
to the tertiary education sector according to the research
profile of participating institutions.  That profile is
assessed on the basis of the research performance of
individual staff members through a Quality Evaluation
process.</p><p>Dr Duncan has taken a particularly active role in
the development of AUS policy on the PBRF since 2002, and
has an active research interest in the PBRF which is in his
field of specialist expertise.</p><p>“My job on the reference
group is to advance the concerns of university staff about
the PBRF, as reflected in AUS policy,” Dr Duncan said.
“AUS members have also put forward a number of alternative
approaches to the assessment of research quality and
productivity, and to the current funding allocation model.
AUS hopes that the Sector Reference Group will be a forum
that is open to critical examination of the problems that
the PBRF has created, and to alternative approaches.”</p><p>Dr
Duncan said that university staff have expressed particular
concerns about accountability in the current PBRF model
falling onto the shoulders of the individual, as the unit of
assessment, and about the misuse of the individual quality
scores and evidence portfolios for internal management
purposes.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>
