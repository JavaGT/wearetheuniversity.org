<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Release</p>

<p>PBRF review provides major opportunity to fix
problems, say university staff</p>

<p>The Association of
University Staff (AUS) has welcomed a review of the
Performance-Based Research Fund, currently being undertaken
by international expert and involving extensive consultation
across the tertiary education sector, saying that it is an
excellent opportunity to put right major flaws in the PBRF's
operation</p>

<p>The review of the PBRF, being carried out by Dr
Jonathan Adams from the United Kingdom, is intended to
examine the PBRF process and, in particular, the experience
of staff involved in preparing evidence portfolios on which
research performance assessments are made. The PBRF provides
$230 million annually in research funding<p>

<p>AUS
National President, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery,
said the review would look at problems that had arisen with
the PBRF and how they might best be resolved. She said that
current assessment and reporting models used for the PBRF
are inappropriate, and the improper use of individual PBRF
ratings in staff performance appraisals not only creates
anger and disillusionment among academic staff, but also
compromises the integrity of staff development procedures
already in place.</p>

<p>“AUS has always rejected the
individual unit of assessment as the basis for the PBRF
model and, equally, has consistently opposed the reporting
of results at that individual level,” said Associate
Professor Montgomery. “Such is the depth of feeling about
these flaws that the possibility of a boycott of future
rounds of the PBRF by union members was raised at the recent
AUS Annual Conference.”</p>

<p>The AUS will also be offering
the reviewer alternative models for assisting with the
distribution of PBRF funding. These will not include a
so-called metrics-based measurement system that uses
citation indices and impact analyses.</p>

<p>Associate Professor
Montgomery also said that the AUS would also bring to the
attention of the review the movement away from PBRF-style
models
internationally.</p>
