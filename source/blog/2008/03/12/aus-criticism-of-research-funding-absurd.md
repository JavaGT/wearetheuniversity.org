<p><br>Criticism of research funding absurd,
say university staff</p>



<p>University staff have labeled as
absurd, criticism of yesterday's announcement by the
government of $700 million in new research funding for
research, development and innovation for pastoral and food
production.</p>



<p>While most groups have welcomed the new
finding, National party leader John Key has described the
New Zealand Fast Forward Fund a "gimmick", saying the model
carries a considerable risk, and will be at the mercy of the
way in which the fund is invested.</p>



<p>Others, have said
that the new funding is too late or too narrow in its
application just to the primary sector.<p>



<p>Association of
University Staff national president, Associate Professor
Maureen Montgomery, said that the new funding was the
biggest ever single investment ever in science and
innovation in the primary sector, and should be welcomed not
criticised. "This fund recognises the continuing importance
of primary production to the New Zealand economy and the
level of investment would pay significant dividends in the
government's aims to transform this country's economy," she
said. "For the National Party leader to dismiss the funding
as a gimmick indicates either that he has little
understanding of the research needs of the country or is
playing political games which assist no
one."</p>
