<p>Media Release - 27 March 2008 - For Immediate Use</p>

<p>Oh Dr
Hutchison, you’ve done it again!</p>

<p>The Auckland University
Students’ Association calls on the National Party to
clarify again whether it believes New Zealand’s
universities should have autonomy and independence in what
they research, or if they should be directed by one of their
MPs.</p>

<p>The Tertiary Education Commission recently awarded 42
Top Achievers Doctoral Scholarships to students undertaking
research in a variety of disciplines. 16 of the 42
scholarships went to students at the University of
Auckland.</p>

<p>National’s Tertiary Education spokesman Dr
Paul Hutchison criticised several doctoral recipients for
the areas they were researching, calling some of the
subjects awarded funds “mind-boggling."</p>

<p>Last year, Dr
Hutchison also targeted particular criticism at a Top
Doctoral Scholarship recipient for studying bogan
culture.</p>

<p>“The point of research is to expand, as well as
boggle, the mind,” says AUSA President David
Do.</p>

<p>“Tertiary institutions should be free from political
interference when it comes to what is studied, taught, and
researched. It’s called academic freedom. What a
politician happens to think of a student’s doctorate
research is, with all due respect, none of their
business."</p>

<p>AUSA also notes that Carey-Ann Morrison of
Waikato University reportedly spoke to Dave Snell (who won a
TEC scholarship last year for his research on bogan culture)
about the possibility of a backlash against her
work.</p>

<p>“When we have postgraduate students concerned
about what politicians think of their research, I think
we’re treading a potentially dangerous line,” says AUSA
Education Vice President Sophia Blair.</p>

<p>“Research should
not be singled out for criticism just because the subject
area may not fit one’s definition of ‘mainstream’.
Students, staff and the wider public need confirmation that
Mr Key believes our tertiary institutions should be free
from political interference,” concludes David
Do.</p>
