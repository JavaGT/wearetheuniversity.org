<p>Progress of women to senior academic
positions glacial, says university staff union</p>

<p>Although
the number of women holding senior academic positions in New
Zealand universities has increased in the last year,
progress toward equity is still glacial according to the
Association of University Staff (AUS).</p>

<p>AUS National
President, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, said that
the New Zealand Census of Women’s Participation 2008,
released by the Human Rights Commission today, revealed that
women held just under 20 percent of senior academic position
in New Zealand universities in 2007, up by 2.28 percent from
the year before.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that women make up
nearly half the academic workforce in universities, they
remain clustered in the lower academic rankings. The
proportion of women professors is only 15.1 percent and
women associate professors 23.19 percent. Six universities
improved their proportion of women in senior academic
positions, while two, AUT and Massey, lost
ground.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Montgomery said that, while
there was no quick fix to improving the proportion of women
employed in senior academic positions, New Zealand
universities could look to Australia, where that country’s
vice-chancellors had undertaken some solid initiatives
towards improving the under representation of women in
senior academia. “What is needed in this country is a
sophisticated and multi-faceted approach to promoting
equity,” she said. “We need to examine both structural
and cultural barriers, and it would be a welcome sign if New
Zealand vice-chancellors demonstrated the same level of
collective commitment to reducing such barriers as their
Australian counterparts were doing.”</p>

<p>The proportion of
women filling ministerial appointments on university
councils ranged from 75 percent (or three out of four
positions) at AUT, to none out of four at the University of
Waikato.</p>
