<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>Media Release</p>

<p>Attn

<p>University staff welcome extra funding, but
more needed</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has
welcomed the announcement today by the Minister for Tertiary
Education, Dr Pete Hodgson, that the tertiary education
sector will receive $900 million in additional funding over
the next four years.<p>

<p>Of that new funding, $15 million has
been specifically allocated through the University
Tripartite Forum to support recruitment and retention
initiatives intended to increase the international
competitiveness of New Zealand universities.</p>

<p>Responding to
today’s Budget announcement, AUS National President,
Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, said that, although
significant gains had been made in recent budgets towards
addressing funding and salary problems within the university
sector, the momentum needed to be increased further still to
ensure the international reputation and competitiveness of
the New Zealand university system. “The need for major
funding increases has been made the more pressing with the
announcement in the recent Australian Budget of more than
$A2 billion in new policy initiatives for higher education
in that country,” she said. “Their Budget announcement
included the establishment of a new $A11 billion Education
Investment Fund and a one-off allocation of $A500 million
for capital development.”</p>

<p>According to Associate
Professor Montgomery, the inclusion of funding targeted at
the recruitment and retention of university staff
illustrates the benefits of unions, vice-chancellors and the
Government working constructively together. “We know that
the tripartite process has been successful in achieving
consensus and providing results for universities, including
university staff,” she said. “What is still need though
is a long-term strategy to deal with under funding and to
increase salaries further still.”</p>

<p>Associate Professor
Montgomery said that AUS will work with the New Zealand
Vice-Chancellors Committee to determine the implications of
today’s announcement for the current bargaining process.<p>
