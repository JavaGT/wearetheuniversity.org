<p>Media Release</p>

Education Reporter

<p></p><center><h3>Come to Massey University and you, too, can
become eye candy....</h3></center><p>In what must be one the most banal
news features emanating from a university this year, Massey
has trumpeted the success of one of its students in
finishing third in the Miss Universe New Zealand beauty
pageant this month after being first runner-up in last
year’s Miss Manawatu contest.</p>

<p>The original version of
the story on the University's website was illustrated with a
publicity photograph of the Bachelor of Science graduate in
a bikini, kneeling in the surf.  By lunchtime, however, the
photograph had been removed, which at least suggests that
the University administration admits that it was
inappropriate for its website.<p>

<p>According to Association
of University Staff National President, Associate Professor
Maureen Montgomery, the news feature was a celebration
neither of the student’s scholastic achievement nor, one
should hope, of Massey University’s ability to train
beauty-pageant contestants.”</p>

<p>Associate Professor
Montgomery said that University students, particularly in
the Arts, are taught to critique such images in terms of
their representational function.  “Massey University has
provided an excellent example of how the desperation to
market universities as ‘attractive’ places to gain
knowledge and transferable skills intersects with the use of
the sexualized female body as a site of desire. Massey’s
story reads like the formulaic sort of thing that aspiring
beauty queens are expected to say when interviewed on the
catwalk.”<p>

<p>“One might expect a university public
relations office to do more than piggy-back off what comes
across as a publicity statement produced by the Miss
Universe organisation.  Surely it can do better in promoting
the campus to prospective students than by using this young
woman who apparently loved “Palmy” and enjoyed the
social life at Massey,” Associate Professor Montgomery
added.</p>
