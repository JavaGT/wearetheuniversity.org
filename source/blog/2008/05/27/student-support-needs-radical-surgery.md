<p>Student support needs radical
surgery</p>

<p>Auckland students believe National’s thoughts of
wiping some medical students’ loans is a promising
development, however caution that the best way forward is to
stop these loans and debt from accumulating in the first
place.</p>

<p>“Medical students have very high workloads, pay
amongst the highest fees in the country, and barely have any
time to work to support themselves,” says AUSA President
David Do.</p>

<p>“Given that many can’t get a student
allowance because of parental means testing up to 25, and
are thus forced to borrow to live, it’s no wonder they
graduate with appallingly high debt."</p>

<p>The 2005 New Zealand
Union of Students Associations’ study ‘Doctors and Debt:
The Effect of Student Debt on New Zealand Doctors,’ found
that only 20% of students received an allowance for the full
six years of their MBChB study.</p>

<p>Two thirds of respondents
in the study also stated they would consider leaving New
Zealand within three years of graduating. The level of debt
also impacts on the professions medical graduates enter.
Financially less-rewarding areas like general practice and
rural practice tend to miss out, contributing to sector-wide
shortages of skilled health workers.</p>

<p>“This is the
perfect illustration of why students need to be properly
supported while they are studying. Surely the concept of
being properly supported while they’re studying in a
valuable profession for New Zealand’s future would very
attractive and encourage our young graduates to stay in New
Zealand,” says Do.</p>

<p>AUSA hopes the National Party will
commit to increasing access to student allowances by
scrapping parental means testing when it develops its
tertiary education
policy.</p>
