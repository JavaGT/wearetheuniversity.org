<p>Protest planned: cuts to teacher education
pose threat to quality</p>

<p>Staff and students at Victoria
University’s College of Education say proposed cuts to
staff numbers and resources at the college pose a serious
threat to the future quality of teacher education in
Wellington. They are holding a protest at the main entrance
to the college on Donald St., Karori at 12.30pm on Thursday
22 May.</p>

<p>Victoria university is proposing to cut over 15
percent of staff (22 of 141 academic and advisory jobs and 7
of 41 administration staff jobs). The proposal includes the
closure of the college’s resource centre.</p>

<p>Association of
University Staff Organiser, Michael Gilchrist, says the
proposed cuts are based solely on an arbitrary figure for
budget overspending. “The university does not have any
plans for maintaining the quality of the college’s core
function, teacher education, while making such severe
cuts.”</p>

<p>Mr Gilchrist said that the university plans to
embark on a crude shift in emphasis from teacher education
to research in education rather than developing a
progressive reshaping of the college. The criterion for
cutting academic and advisory jobs will be the research
capability of the people in those jobs, not the functional
capability of the college itself.</p>

<p>“The Government must
take part of the responsibility for this situation. It has
markedly reduced funding levels for taught postgraduate
degrees when such degrees are overwhelmingly preferred by
teachers wanting to upgrade their qualifications. And it has
done nothing to recognize the funding needs of Colleges of
Education within universities,” Mr Gilchrist said. “The
resulting rush by the university to secure funds set aside
for research threatens to leave teacher education in the
dust.<p>

<p>“Both the shape and the scale of the proposed
cuts need to be seriously reconsidered. The college has a
long and proud history of producing creative, innovative and
dedicated graduates. You cannot lose 15% of teaching staff
and offer the same quality of teacher education”, Mr
Gilchrist added.<p>
