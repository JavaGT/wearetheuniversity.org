<p>Association of University Staff</p>

<p>More investment needed for universities</p>

<p>The
Association of University Staff (AUS) is calling for greater
investment in New Zealand universities in the 2008 Budget to
ensure that they are sufficiently funded to meet the
country’s research and education challenges of the
twenty-first century.</p>

<p>AUS National President, Associate
Professor Maureen Montgomery, has warned that the university
sector is facing a funding crisis, particularly in terms of
salaries, and that this is likely to compromise the high
quality and good reputation of New Zealand’s university
system unless addressed as a matter of priority. She said
that the need for major funding increases has been made the
more pressing with the announcement in the recent Australian
Budget of more than $A2 billion in new policy initiatives
for higher education in that country,” she said. “Their
Budget announcement included the establishment of a new $A11
billion Education Investment Fund and a one-off allocation
of $A500 million for capital development.”</p>

<p>Associate
Professor Montgomery said that New Zealand will need between
700 and 800 new academic staff by 2010-11, a time when it is
predicted that there will be a worldwide shortage of
academics. By then, the European Union countries alone will
need an additional 10 to 15,000 new academic staff just to
cope with increasing student numbers.</p>

<p>“Every university
system in the world is currently in an increasingly
competitive market to recruit and retain top-class academic
and support staff,” Associate Professor Montgomery said.
“Providing funding targeted at improving salaries is an
important part of ensuring the vitality and the high quality
of New Zealand universities.”</p>

<p>Associate Professor
Montgomery said that the long-term well-being of the country
would be better served by increasing investment in
universities as a part of the 2008 Budget, rather than by
cutting taxes as has been advocated by those with a more
narrow and short-term
outlook.</p>
