28 May 2006</b></p><p><b>University salaries lagging according
to new report</b></p><p>A new report shows that New Zealand
universities salaries continue to lag well behind their
overseas counterparts, giving rise to concerns that, unless
significant action is taken, New Zealand universities will
to lose staff in increasing numbers to Australia and other
countries.</p><p>The report, <i>University Staff Academic
Salaries and Remuneration</i>, prepared by the accounting
firm Deloitte, compares figures from comparable universities
in four other countries against which New Zealand competes
for academic staff. A central conclusion of the report is
that, while New Zealand salaries have increased at a greater
rate than the other countries over the last three years,
they remain significantly lower than Australia, Canada, the
United States and the United Kingdom, even when adjusted for
purchasing power parity. </p><p>Association of University Staff
national president, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery,
said that although the government had made available more
than $61 million in new funding for salaries over the last
three years, much more was needed if the pay differential
between the countries was not to balloon. “The growth in
academic salaries in this country is consistently less than
growth in GDP, while the opposite occurs in Australia, and
it is that country from which we face the greatest threat to
recruitment and retention,” she said. “Australian
university staff have lodged a claim to increase salaries by
27 percent over the next three years which they are
confident of achieving,”

<p>Associate Professor Montgomery
said that the disparity in salaries is compounded by better
non-salary benefits in other countries, such as
superannuation where employers made a contribution of as
much as 17 percent of salary. </p><p>The negotiation of
collective employment agreements will begin in New Zealand
universities in June.</p><p>The full report can be found
