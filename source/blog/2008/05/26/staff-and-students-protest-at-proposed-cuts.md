Release</p><p></p><p>Attn Education Reporter 22 May 2008</p><p></p><p>Staff
and students protest at proposed cuts at College of
Education in Wellington</p><p></p><p>Staff and students at Victoria
University's College of Education protested today at
proposed cuts to staff numbers and resources at the college
which they say pose a serious threat to the future quality
of teacher education in Wellington. </p><p></p><p>Victoria
university is proposing to cut over 15 percent of staff  (22
of 141 academic and advisory jobs and 7 of 41 administration
staff jobs). The proposal includes the closure of the
college's resource centre.</p><p></p><p>Mr Gilchrist said that the
university proposes a crude shift in emphasis from teacher
education to research in education without ensuring the
continuing quality of teacher education. The criterion for
cutting academic and advisory jobs will be the research
capability of the people in those jobs, not the functional
capability of the college, especially its core function of
providing high quality teacher education.</p><p></p><p>"The
Government must take part of the responsibility for this
situation. It has markedly reduced funding levels for taught
postgraduate degrees when such degrees are overwhelmingly
preferred by teachers wanting to upgrade their
qualifications. And it has done nothing to recognize the
funding needs of Colleges of Education within universities,"
Mr Gilchrist said. "The resulting rush by the university to
secure funds set aside for research threatens to leave
teacher education in the dust.

<p></p><p> "Both the shape and the
scale of the proposed cuts need to be seriously
reconsidered. The college has a long and proud history of
producing creative, innovative and dedicated graduates and
that needs to be maintained,"  Mr Gilchrist added.
</p><p></p><p>About 60 students and 20 staff took part in today's
protest with many staff preferring to remain anonymous for
fear that their actions could have consequences for their
future employment in the proposed restructure.</p><p></p><p> "The
university has refused to include a union nominated observer
in this process to ensure due consideration of submissions
and fairness for staff. That lack of transparency is only
exacerbating staff concern about this proposal," Mr
Gilchrist
said.</p><p><br>ENDS</p><p><br><!-- LINKS REMOVED
