<p>Staff union welcomes TEC
appointment</p>

<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has
welcomed the appointment of Professor Roy Sharp as the new
Chief Executive of the Tertiary Education
Commission.</p>

<p>Professor Sharp is currently the
vice-chancellor of the University of Canterbury and will
take up his new position in August this year.</p>

<p>AUS National
President, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, said the
appointment of a chief executive from the university sector
would ensure that there was a clear understanding of the
issues faced by universities and their role within the
Tertiary Education Strategy.</p>

<p>Associate Professor
Montgomery said AUS had worked well with Professor Sharp in
his role as Chair of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’
Committee, particularly in the establishment of a tripartite
process among the universities, government and university
unions. “Through that process, around $46 million in new
funding was made available to university staff for funding
for salaries,” she said. “We are confident that we will
continue that positive working relationship with Professor
Sharp at
TEC.”</p>
