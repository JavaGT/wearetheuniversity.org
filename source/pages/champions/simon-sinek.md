# [Simon Sinek & Trevor Noah on Friendship, Loneliness, Vulnerability, and More | Full Conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNBxIhxHHxM)

Good afternoon, everybody. How you doing?

As you can see, there’s nothing up here because there was nothing here. I’ll tell you how this came to be.

First of all, thank you—and I hate you, Anastasia. But we were having a conversation in the little courtyard yesterday, and I bumped into Simon. I’ve seen him around a bunch—I love him. I always tell him I have the biggest brain crush on him.

We were having this discussion, and then Sarah came out from the team and said, “Are you guys speaking?” And we were like, “No, we’re not. Blah blah blah. Would you like to?” I said I’d speak if he does something—I just want to listen to him. Then Anastasia was like, “I heard you.” And now, here we are.

I’m not going to waste anybody’s time because I’m sure many of you will agree with me: If you don’t know this man right here, he is honestly one of the greatest thinkers of our generation. I love how his mind works, how he challenges us, how he thinks about thinking.

The genesis of this conversation yesterday was simple: What are you fascinated by right now? Because I know you’re always working on something, always drilling into something. Yeah, what are you fascinated by right now?

_Simon Sinek:_
It’s interesting because the common theme we’ve been hearing from all the talks today is that passion isn’t some manufactured thing where you “find” your passion and do what you’re passionate about. Passion is an output, not an input. What we hear is somebody finds an obsession for something, and that becomes their passion. The same is definitely true for you, for me.

The thing I’m obsessing about right now is friendship.

There’s an entire industry to help us be better leaders. An entire industry to help us be better parents. An entire industry to help us eat better, exercise better, sleep better. And yet, there’s barely anything on how to be a friend.

If you think about all the mental health challenges so many of us face today—whether it’s coping with stress, depression, anxiety, addiction, even obsession with longevity—friendship is the ultimate biohack. It literally fixes all those things.

_Trevor Noah:_
It’s interesting you said this. I’ve always felt—I’m not a very superstitious person, grew up very religious—but I do believe in some sort of magic in the universe. Every time I bump into you, I feel like we’re thinking about the same thing but on slightly different paths. Usually, people are forced to listen to us talk about that. (I apologize.)

But the reason this fascinates me is because I’ve been thinking a lot about friendship and what it means. A friend of mine said to me recently on a trip: “In successful spaces, people often use the word ‘sacrifice.’ We heard Martin, we heard so many people on stage saying ‘sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice.’”

And she said one of the most powerful things ever to me: “When we say we’ve sacrificed something for our career, we shouldn’t be afraid to put a name to who that sacrifice was—because often, it was the people in our lives we call friends.”

Yeah.

I wanted to know: Have you been thinking about that? What is the balance? What is the confluence? How do you think of friendship and the sacrifice that brings you here to sit with people—where you may make new friends or not?

_Simon Sinek:_
I think, definitely for me (I can’t speak for anybody else), the sacrifice was lopsided. Especially for high performers—who later in life start to realize that network of friends sometimes isn’t there because you’ve sacrificed.

How many of us have canceled on friends because a meeting comes up? “They’ll understand.” And yet, the reverse is very rarely true. We’ll say to someone in a meeting, “Can we meet Friday instead of Thursday?” But we wouldn’t say, “In my calendar is a friend.”

Definitely for me, the times I’ve tripped, slipped, fell, hit rock bottom, felt alone—my work wasn’t going to rescue me. It was by the grace of some higher power that there was always a friend who saw it, recognized it in me, and picked me up.

So I realized: We talk about investing. We talk about… this is a different kind of investment. You and I were talking about it the other day—people are moving from California and New York to Texas and Florida to avoid paying taxes because they want to save money.

But I want it to be the reverse. I’m not worried about saving money to be in a place I don’t want to live. I want to live with the people I love. And if it costs more—and by “cost,” I mean maybe I won’t achieve that thing, maybe I’ll miss that deadline, maybe I’ll miss that quarter—it’s a different kind of sacrifice.

We think of sacrifices always against people, but I can make a sacrifice for my career for my friends. It’s about striking that right balance—because your friends will be there for you. Your work won’t.

_Trevor Noah:_
I love that line: “Your friends will be there for you. Your work won’t.”

I was talking to a friend about this conversation, and they asked, “What do you love about Simon so much?” I said, “What I love about Simon is—I feel like you’re a truffle pig of ideas that will shape the world.”

What I mean by that is… I’m French. Whatever you take from that, take it. But I love seeing what you’re sniffing around in because I believe it’s connected to something far greater. It’s not the truffle, but the meal that’s now going to influence the restaurant, the world it’s going to shape.

You have that brain. Friendship—yes. But why would you care about friendship on a global scale? What’s in it, Simon? What’s happening?

_Simon Sinek:_
Let me take one step back. Our understanding of addiction largely comes from an experiment done in the ’50s or ’60s where they put a rat in a cage with two water bottles—one plain, one laced with drugs. The rat discovered the drugged water, drank more and more, and killed itself.

Our understanding of addiction comes from this study. But a guy named Bruce Alexander said, “Hold on, the study is flawed. Rats, like us, are social animals. We put a rat by itself in solitude—of course it became an addict.”

He recreated the experiment with multiple rats—social community, wheels, mazes, babies. They had both plain and drugged water. They all tried the drugged water enough to get addicted, but their intake declined, and they mostly drank the plain water.

This gives evidence that if we have close friendships, if we live in community, perhaps we’re less susceptible to addiction.

We talk about the addiction of social media, cell phones—which is true. It’s a highly dopamine-producing device causing loneliness. But I’d argue if we worked on friendships—and more importantly, if we taught our children how to be friends—they’d be less likely to get addicted.

So when you ask, “What’s the global responsibility?”—we’re teaching people how to do everything. We’re finding hacks for everything. The one thing we aren’t doing is the old-fashioned, hard, slow thing: making friends.

_Trevor Noah:_
That’s such a common misunderstanding—“I didn’t want to burden you.” People don’t realize: We don’t build trust by offering help. We build trust by asking for it.

_Simon Sinek:_
Say that again.

_Trevor Noah:_
We don’t build trust by offering help. We build trust by asking for it.

_Simon Sinek:_
Damn.

_Trevor Noah:_
Why is that?

_Simon Sinek:_
Because—and I’m sure everyone here has had this experience—someone was in pain, didn’t call you for fear of bothering you. Then you find out later, and your reaction is: “How dare you be so selfish to deny me the honor of being there for you?”

That’s when you know a friend is a friend—when it’s an absolute honor to be there at the time they least want to call you.

_Trevor Noah:_
Do you think women have a better grasp of friendship than men?

_Simon Sinek:_
100%. I think for that reason, women make better CEOs. They have a better understanding of the human dynamic. Women come up to me more often than men, and they get my work much better. Men ask for case studies—they want me to prove that trusting people, loving people, is good for business. Women inherently understand that.

Women are less afraid to say “I love you” to their friends.

_Trevor Noah:_
One of the conversations I had recently was about the rise of the right in the world. There’s so much happening—but one big thing I’ve been worried about is young men: how angry they’ve become, how isolated, how they’ve turned that anger into a community.

It’s ironic—they form online communities based in loneliness, anger, but they don’t teach each other to hug, to love, to feel. Instead, they ferment hate—against women, the government, society.

I wonder if this world you’re speaking about is showing its effects now—men who haven’t found anything beyond “What am I beyond what I do?” A lot of these men are unemployed, asking, “Who am I because of who I’m around?”

_Simon Sinek:_
It’s a huge insight. What does this have to do with the bigger world? I don’t think I’ve ever heard a serious discussion about understanding a 20-something-year-old virgin who lives with their parents, unemployed, and how that connects to global terrorism or violence.

When you come from a shame-based society and find others suffering like you, it’s incredibly compelling. You feel seen. You feel understood.

As the British documentarian Dian [sic] says—whether talking about white supremacists or jihadis—they are not driven by hate. They are driven by love. They’re desperately looking for belonging.

When our nations don’t provide this—when our leaders don’t—we’re seeing a loss of idealism. Leaders used to talk about world peace. Now, a conversation like ours sounds cheesy.

When idealism is missing, we still look for belonging—but we find it in dark places. We’re witnessing the loss of idealism in the world right now, finding community at low levels and tearing each other apart.

_Trevor Noah:_
Before we run out of time—one more thing. During Jay’s presentation, he asked, “What do you wish you’d spent more time doing?” And she said, “I wish I’d spent more time with my friends.”

I’ve spoken to some of you in the audience—some of the most successful people, VCs, etc. At dinners, I’ve asked, “How’s your friend group?” And many say, “Oh, I haven’t seen my friends in a while.”

Do you think there’s a way to find balance—between family, being a CEO, a leader—and still make room for what society has deemed a “nice-to-have”? Friendship is never seen as essential.

Last year, I came here with a friend as a plus-one. People asked, “Who’s this?” I said, “My friend.” They said, “But what does he do?” I said, “He’s my friend.”

I wonder—for rooms like this, where people are high-powered, intense, focused on family and business—do you think about that?

_Simon Sinek:_
It is more amazing to have an amazing experience with someone than by yourself. You can go alone and say, “Look what I did,” or you can say, “Remember that time we did that?”

I think leaders bear greater responsibility because people follow their leaders. As goes the leader, so goes the organization, the country. As go the parents, so go the children. (“Put your phones away—Mom and Dad are on theirs the whole dinner.”)

If a leader publicly said, “It’s my friend’s birthday—I’m leaving early to celebrate,” people would prioritize friends more. It’s a leadership problem.

Another thing I’ve realized: We shouldn’t take for granted how much ignoring friendships has affected romantic relationships. People have shifted all the expectation, support, love they got from a community of friends onto one person.

Studies show having a friend to talk to about your partner actually improves your chances of staying with them.

_Trevor Noah:_
Wow. I’m having an insight here. Thank you for being the truffle pig and uncovering this.

The same thing happening at work is happening in relationships. We used to have bowling leagues, church, barbecues with neighbors. Over time, those disappeared. Now, we demand work be our place of purpose, community, social life, politics.

We’re doing the same in relationships—abandoning outside connections and asking our partners to be everything. That’s an unfair standard.

I’ve never thought about it from the workplace angle. That’s why you’re my favorite truffle pig.

Anastasia says we’re out of time, so I’ll leave you with this:

In Zulu, we have a saying—“Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu.” It means: “A person is a person only because of other people.”

I’m genuinely a better person because of you, my friend. Thank you for being here with me, for sharing this with us.

# [The Infinite Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tye525dkfi8)

January 1968. The North Vietnamese Army launched a surprise attack against American forces. We know this as the **Tet Offensive**. Tet is the Vietnamese equivalent of Christmas, and for decades, there was a tradition in Vietnam that there was never any fighting on Tet—much like the ceasefires during World War I on Christmas.

Except in this particular incident in 1968, the Vietnamese forces decided to break with tradition, overwhelm the American forces, and hopefully bring a swift end to the war.

And that’s exactly what they attempted to do. They threw **85,000 troops** at over **125 U.S. and allied targets** across the country—and they caught the Americans **completely by surprise**. Many of the commanding officers weren’t even at their posts. They were in town celebrating Tet, expecting no fighting.

Here’s the amazing thing: **The United States repelled every single attack thrown at them during the Tet Offensive. Every single one.** Most of the major fighting had ceased after about a week (though it went on for about a month). After that week, the Americans had lost **fewer than a thousand troops**. The North Vietnamese lost **35,000 out of the 85,000 troops** they attacked with.

And if we look at the Vietnam War as a whole:

- The United States lost **58,000 people** over the course of ten years.
    
- The North Vietnamese lost **three million people** over the same period.
    

To put that in perspective, that’s the population equivalent of the United States losing **27 million of our own**.

And if we look closely at the Vietnam War, the United States actually **won the vast majority of the battles they fought**, including most of the major ones.

So it raises a very interesting question: **How do you decimate your enemy, win all the important battles, and still lose the war?**

### **Finite vs. Infinite Games**

As it turns out, we don’t fully understand—or at least, there are multiple definitions of—what winning and losing mean.

If you have at least one competitor, you have a game. And there are **two types of games**:

1. **Finite games** – Known players, fixed rules, and an agreed-upon objective (e.g., football).
    
2. **Infinite games** – Known and unknown players, changeable rules, and the objective is to **perpetuate the game** (to stay in it as long as possible).
    

- When a **finite player** vs. **finite player** compete, the system is stable (e.g., football).
    
- When an **infinite player** vs. **infinite player** compete, the system is also stable (e.g., the Cold War—no winner or loser, just players continuing until one drops out).
    

But problems arise when you pit a **finite player vs. an infinite player**—because one is playing to **win**, and the other is playing to **keep playing**. They make profoundly different strategic choices, which ultimately results in the finite player burning through will and resources, finding themselves in a quagmire, and eventually dropping out.

**This is what happened to the United States in Vietnam.**

- The Americans were trying to **beat** the North Vietnamese.
    
- The North Vietnamese were **fighting for their lives**.
    

The U.S. wasn’t just fighting the wrong war—they were fighting the **wrong game**.

### **The Wrong Game in Business, Politics, and Education**

This gets me thinking about other contexts—business, politics, even education.

- There’s no such thing as **winning business**.
    
- There’s no such thing as **winning global politics**.
    
- There’s definitely no such thing as **winning education**.
    

Yet, if we listen to the language of too many organizations, they don’t know the game they’re in. They talk about:

- Being the **best**.
    
- Being **number one**.
    
- **Beating** their competition.
    

The problem? **There’s no such thing.**

Any metrics we choose—whether it’s a ranking in a magazine (with arbitrary criteria) or one university declaring itself "#1 in X" while another claims "#1 in Y"—are meaningless because **we haven’t agreed on the rules or timeframes**. It’s all smoke and mirrors.

And if you’re playing by those rules, it becomes harder to:

- Maintain resources (money is now the primary objective, when it never should have been).
    
- Keep the **will** of the people (staff, teachers, students) committed to advancing the organization.
    

### **A Real-Life Example: Microsoft vs. Apple**

I spoke at an education summit at **Microsoft** and another at **Apple**.

- At **Microsoft**, most executives spent their time talking about **how to beat Apple**.
    
- At **Apple**, 100% of the executives spent their time talking about **how to help teachers teach and students learn**.
    

One was obsessed with **where they were going**.  
The other was obsessed with **their competition**.

Guess which one was in quagmire?

At the end of my Microsoft talk, they gave me a gift—the **Zune** (Microsoft’s iPod competitor). It was beautifully designed, intuitive, brilliant.

Later, sharing a taxi with a senior Apple executive (employee #54), I stirred the pot:

- **Me:** _"Microsoft gave me their Zune. It’s so much better than your iPod Touch."_
    
- **Apple exec:** _"I have no doubt."_
    

And the conversation was over.

Because the **infinite player** understands:

- Sometimes your competitor has the better product.
    
- Sometimes you do.
    
- Sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes behind.
    
- There’s no such thing as **best**, **first**, or **beating the competition**.
    

There’s only **ahead and behind**—and the only real competition is **yourself**.

### **How to Play the Infinite Game**

There are **five key elements**:

1. **A Just Cause** – Why does your organization exist? (Not just "education"—that’s table stakes.)
    
2. **Courageous Leadership** – Willing to sacrifice short-term gains for long-term vision.
    
3. **Trusting Teams** – Where people feel safe to admit mistakes, ask for help, and grow.
    
4. **A Worthy Rival** – Not to beat, but to reveal your weaknesses and push you to improve.
    
5. **A Flexible Playbook** – Adaptable strategies for an ever-changing game.
    

### **Final Thought**

If being at this university is going to be your legacy, do you want your tombstone to read:

- _"Top Fundraiser"_?  
    Or:
    
- _"They served those who devoted themselves to the cause"_?
    
**Good luck.**
