### Overview
The Critical University Studies Reading Group meets bi-weekly to discuss readings related to the critique of higher education institutions. The group is open to both in-person and online participation.

### Values
- Community Building: A space to connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about critically engaging with higher education.
- Critical Thinking: Encouraging deep, reflective discussions on the structures, policies, and practices of universities.
- Inclusivity: Open to all, regardless of background or expertise. No prior knowledge is required, and everyone’s perspective is valued.
- Low-Stakes Participation: Come as you are—whether you’ve done the reading or not, your presence and ideas are welcome.
- Solidarity and Support: A collaborative environment where members uplift and learn from one another.
- Praxis-Oriented: Bridging theory and action by exploring how academic critique can inform real-world change.
