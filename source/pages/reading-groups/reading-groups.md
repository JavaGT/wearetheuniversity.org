The Society for Research into Higher Education was founded in 1965, and over its 60-year history has worked as a membership society dedicated to the furtherance of the understanding of Higher Education through support for and promotion of research into HE, and by encouraging knowledge exchange amongst researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. We do this primarily through an extensive programme of events, our major annual international conference, and the publication of quality research in our highly respected peer-reviewed journals and book series.
