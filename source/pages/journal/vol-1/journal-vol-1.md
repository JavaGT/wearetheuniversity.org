‘But the entry of big business onto the campuses is doing more than turning buildings into advertising billboards. [Former] Auckland vice-chancellor Kit Carson assured corporations that in return for their “donation,” the university would provide the “quality graduates” they wanted. Like other universities, Auckland is re-writing its course prescriptions according to the express wishes of big business.’
Grant Brookes and David Colyer
