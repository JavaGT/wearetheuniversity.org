The world is seeing something of a revival in radical student politics – action on a massive scale is taking place amongst students in the UK, in Greece, in Turkey and in Chile. And the week before last, in little old New Zealand too a Nationwide Day of Student Action took place. 200 students stormed the Hunter Building at Victoria University to protest the cut- ting or closure of Gender Studies, International Relations, University Preparation and the Crime and Justice Centre as well as the sacking of lecturers. Likewise at Auckland, a planned Teach-In in the Library Basement became the first step to a full-scale movement to wrest control back from an increasingly heavy-handed management who is trying to stymie aca- demic freedoms. These actions herald a possible return to the radical student politics that had their heyday in the 1960s and 70s – but are we up to the challenge?

It is a familiar refrain amongst veteran student activists and champions of left- liberal causes that most of the current student population doesn’t give a shit. And similarly, those lumped into the ‘apathetic’ category are seen to believe that the episodic small-scale protests that occur are largely irrelevant to their own lives. They are represented as only wanting to get in, get learnt, get out and get paid. Ultimately, for mass student action to be successful these two groups need to stop talking past each other and we need to recognize that all of us have the capacity to care - but that people also care differently.

So for those of you who haven’t engaged in student politics before, maybe you would care if you knew how it affected you personally?

It affects you personally when your freedom to choose what you wish to study

is restricted by upper management. It affects you personally when universities try to shut down protests and curtail your fundamental democratic right to free speech. It affects you personally when your lecturers don’t have enough time for you – not because they don’t want to make time – but because the university is sucking them dry with its ridiculous de- mands for research output and accountability.

It affects you personally when you have to work twenty hours a week on top of your university workload, just to scrape by. Or when you have to live at home with your parents because living in Auckland is too expensive. It affects you personally when you graduate with $40,000-$50,000 worth of student debt which, for most people, you will be paying off for the next twenty or thirty years. To shoulder that much debt for the sake of your future employment is just plain irrational – and there’s no guarantee your degree will secure you a job anymore anyway. So get involved in the upcoming protests, if not for everyone else – then for yourself. Because ultimately you are the one who will have to shoul- der these burdens, and it sucks pretty hard to have to do it alone.

So are we up to the challenge? Fuck yeah we are. Whether you’re on the left or the right, whether this affects you as an individual or as part of the collective student body, get out there and make yourself heard. Who knows, you might actually enjoy it.
