The university is sacred, a site dedicated to the stimulation of creative imaginations, the fostering of original ideas and flows of information. It is a site for the contestation of ideas and information, pure thought that speaks to power. The university has a vital role to play toward the formulation of radicalism and acts as site where radicalism is propagated and disseminated. The university is foremost a political site, for it is the precise place where the interpretation of the void acts as a primary premise. It does not seek to justify existing structures rather it is the site of the contestation of the structures and the home of deter- minate negation, performing the task of critique with constructive purpose to ameliorate society of its injustices and ills. The university seeks to provide the intellectual tools for growth and expansion of knowledge toward emancipation. The university is an open and inclusive site where democracy and equality are fundamentally explored. The university is free.
