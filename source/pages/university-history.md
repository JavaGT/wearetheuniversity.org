# The New Zealand University
> As well as being the examining and degree-granting body for all New Zealand university colleges, the University of New Zealand was also responsible for approving qualifications and, perhaps most importantly, for conducting examinations and marking papers. The early university community was small and relatively inexperienced; many professors saw themselves as teachers and resisted the idea of also being examiners. For these reasons, and to help ensure that New Zealand standards were on a par with those in the United Kingdom, papers were sent there for marking, so that many months passed from the time students sat an exam until the results were received. This practice continued for most of the life of the university and only ended with the Second World War; not only were there issues with sending papers into a war zone but many of the markers were employed in the war effort.

# Late 19th century (1800s)

## 1869
> The University of Otago is New Zealand’s oldest university. In June 1870 the Otago Provincial Council passed the Otago University Ordinance, creating the University of Otago as a corporate body with powers to grant degrees in arts, medicine, law and music. The university opened in July 1871, with a staff of three professors.

## 1870
> The University of New Zealand was established by statute in 1870, when only one university existed in New Zealand, the University of Otago. When institutions were established in Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington they became constituent colleges of the University; Otago, as its establishment predated that of the University of New Zealand, was allowed to retain the word 'university' in its title. This first national body was relatively small throughout its life, with few staff.

## Sept 1870
> The University of New Zealand was created by Act of Parliament and became the examining and degree-granting body for all New Zealand university institutions. Colleges were then established in Christchurch (Canterbury College, 1873), Auckland (1883) and Wellington (Victoria University College, 1897).

## Stolen whenua
> As with other settler states—namely the US, Canada, and Australia—higher education in New Zealand is “part of a nexus of power and governmentality shaped by a history of colonial invasion” (Kidman, 2020, p. 249). All bar two (AUT and Waikato) of New Zealand’s universities were built in the late 19th century and initially funded by income from government land reserves in order to deliver a curriculum servicing the needs of the settler-colonial state, and all eight remain physically occupying stolen whenua (Kidman, 1999; A. Smith et al., 2021).

> **Jack (2023, p.37)**

### Connections to today
> As such, New Zealand’s universities are rooted in colonial violence and efforts to secure the hegemonic power of the settler-colonial state by producing a particular settler workforce (and a particular Māori subject) (Kidman, 1999, 2020). Not yet dissimilar from this early function, New Zealand’s universities continue to maintain a racialised class divide within Aotearoa and enforce the onto-epistemological supremacy of white, Western knowledge and knowledge production (L. T. Smith, 2020). New Zealand’s universities were and still are institutions of settler-colonial capitalism. Neoliberalism can be understood as an ideological interlocutor of the contemporary settler-colonial state (Carey, 2016; Stein, 2022). The individualist market rationalism of neoliberal governmentality continues the state’s project of assimilation by using discourses of free choice and personal responsibility to cement the idea that colonisation has ended. This sensibility can, therefore, deny the possibility that structural racism or whiteness exists in either public or private institutions, masking the continued oppression of Indigenous and racialised people by making structural violence appear instead as the deserved consequence of poor personal choices (Yacobi & Tzfadia, 2017). This ideological interaction forms the university into a corporate machine that continues the original role of universities as a tool of capitalist, settler-colonial violence (Carey, 2016; Stein, 2022). Techniques like incorporating diversity discourses into strategic plans are operationalised to do this obscuring work (Ahmed, 2012; Carey, 2016). Further, as Mignolo (2012) writes, neoliberalism is not solely economic but a “new civilizing project” (p. 24)—neoliberalism and settler-colonialism inform the subjectification of individuals through the university, shaping which bodies and knowledge can exist within the institution and how they can do so (Ahmed, 2015). For instance, techniques like promoting very small numbers of Indigenous and racialised academics into the professoriate create a referential good institutional subject against whom others can be designated bad and governed into mimicking (Ahmed, 2015; Kidman, 2020; Naepi & Naepi, 2022). Neoliberalism allows settler-colonial universities to simultaneously negate their structure and any demands for change and capitalise on the presence of racialised bodies whilst moulding them into neoliberal subjects. Understanding the original colonial purposes of New Zealand’s universities and their more subtle neoliberal continuation provides an important context for analysing universities as institutions of neoliberal government. Examining other structuring ideologies of the university contextualises experiences specific to the Indigenous and racialised participants in this research. Further, it demonstrates that universities here were always, and remain, useful to the state for producing self-governing subjects in the interests of power. New Zealand’s white, settler-colonial, neoliberal universities are the intended products of oppressive power, explicitly designed to perform this normalising work. Tracing the development and effects of New Zealand’s universities as settler-colonial is beyond the scope of this thesis, [^11] nor is it my role as a Pākehā researcher to undertake research focused specifically on Indigenous and racialised (queer and LGBTQTakatāpui+) students in Aotearoa. Instead, this brief discussion reminds us that New Zealand’s universities have always been operants of normative power.

## 1918
> While only Otago was able to claim full university status, the colleges in Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington made periodic attempts to gain this, the first of these being in 1918.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

## 1925
> A Royal Commission in 1925 considered making Auckland a full university, with Canterbury and Wellington remaining colleges within the University of New Zealand, while five years later another plan was to abolish the university and replace it with two independent universities. Despite occasional discussions over the next few years, the issue was only resolved with the Hughes Parry report of 1959, prepared by Professor (later Sir) David Hughes Parry, a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of London.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

## 1946
> Before the Second World War little research was conducted in the universities, and indeed some saw research as a distraction from what they considered to be the principal activity of universities, teaching. (One College council chair even declared, “If a professor has time for research, it shows that he is not doing his job properly.”)  After the war this attitude changed, and research became an increasingly important role of universities.
> 
> In 1946, the Director of Education gave the University of New Zealand £10,000 for university research and it was this grant that the University Research Committee was formed to distribute. The Hughes Parry report recommended that the UGC expand this committee into a Postgraduate Scholarships and Research Grants Committee, with a much larger budget (£100,000). This committee consisted of the UGC chair, the Director-General of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and five university teachers (later expanded to seven once Massey and Waikato became universities). The committee made grants to all sections of the universities, except for medical and dental schools which had access to much larger sums distributed by the Medical Research Council (the forerunner of today’s Health Research Council).

> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

## 1948
> The UGC [(University Grants Committee)] that began life in 1961 was not in fact the first; one had been created by the University of New Zealand in 1948 “to enquire into the finances of University education in NZ and to advise the Government on these needs and on the application of any grants that may be made by Parliament towards them”.  This first UGC persuaded the government to adopt quinquennial funding and devised an allocation formula for the distribution of funding.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

## 1959 Hughes Parry report
> The Hughes Parry report recommended that the University of New Zealand be abolished and four standalone universities be established. To ensure that national needs were met, he also recommended that a central national authority be established and made operational before the university was disestablished. This body, the University Grants Committee (UGC), was to be given financial as well as academic responsibility for the universities. To allow for a smooth transition, it was to come into being on 1 January 1961, one year before the university was to be disestablished.
>
> Although the Hughes Parry report made no recommendation as to a committee of Vice-Chancellors, it suggest they should meet regularly to exchange information, and the Act creating the UGC also set up the NZVCC. As with the UGC, it did not formally assume responsibilities until 1 January 1962, but started work the previous year.
>
> The UGC had eight members (all appointed by the government), a chair, three lay members and three academics from the (then four) universities. Under its Act, the UGC’s functions and powers were to:

> 1. publish information on university education and research
> 
> 2. examine New Zealand’s needs for university research
> 
> 3. investigate the financial needs of the universities
> 
> 4. plan for university developments
> 
> 5. allocate government grant monies to the universities
> 
> 6. provide support for the Universities Entrance Board, the Curriculum Committee, the Research Committee, the Vice-Chancellors’ Committee and the Council of Legal Education.
> 
> These last functions took up much of the UGC’s time and some were to form the basis of the responsibilities given to the NZVCC by the 1989 Education Act.
>
> The UE Board (UEB), while not a subcommittee of the UGC, had its chair and five of its ten members appointed by the UGC. The UEB set and collected fees for the University Entrance examination and provided an important source of revenue for the UGC. Throughout the life of the UGC, examination fees accounted for about 75% of all the UGC’s income, though this was offset by substantial costs of employing markers, and stationery and postage charges. In all, approximately half of the salary costs incurred by those working in University House, where the UGC was located (and the site of the Ministry of Education’s head office in Bowen Street, Wellington) were for UEB work.
> 
> Towards the end of its existence, the University of New Zealand had set up a Curriculum Committee to try and ensure equivalence of standards between courses varying in content between and examined by the separate institutions (the Colleges) but offered as University of New Zealand degrees. Under the UGC, the Committee’s work was expanded to include a concern for the rational use of resources, the market need (and academic justification) for new courses and whether it was appropriate for one or more of the universities to offer them.

## 1961
> Universities New Zealand (UNZ) in its current form (as the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC)—the legal name of UNZ) dates to the 1989 Education Act; it was, however, created by the Education Act of 1961 as one of the successor bodies to the University of New Zealand, along with the University Grants Committee (UGC). UNZ  officially came into existence on 1 January 1962, but had operated informally from 1 January the previous year; indeed for 1961 all three organisations co-existed.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

> In its [(The University of New Zealand's)] last year of existence (1961) its budget for salaries was only £19,000—at a time when a professor earned £2,000 and a lecturer £1,000. Unlike most institutions with the word 'university' in their title, the University of New Zealand had no students to teach and indeed no academics to teach them. While the Vice-Chancellor was often an academic, this was a part-time role; one of the university's longest serving Vice-Chancellors, Sir Thomas Hunter, was also a professor of Philosophy at Victoria University College.

## 1 Jan 1962
> The University of New Zealand was disestablished and the four university colleges became full universities in their own right.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

## 1 Jan 1964
> Two new universities were created, the University of Waikato and Massey University. The University of Waikato was established to cater for the needs of the area around Hamilton, now New Zealand’s fourth largest city. Massey University in Palmerston North began life as the New Zealand Agricultural College in 1926 (renamed Massey Agricultural College in 1927).

## 1966-1980s
> The NZVCC—the legal name of the present Universities New Zealand—was set up to provide a forum for the Vice-Chancellors to discuss issues of common interest; the University of New Zealand and the UGC, while important bodies, were for the universities but not of them. The responsibility for servicing the NZVCC was left to the UGC, which provided part-time secretarial support. When the Vice-Chancellors considered what formal support was needed, it was on the assumption that only a few hours a week would be needed; “a retired person of senior government status” was seen as the most suitable appointment. It was not until 1966 that a permanent appointment was made, with an office provided at Victoria University of Wellington. In 1974 a conference of universities recommended that the NZVCC should play a more active and public role in promoting universities and their contribution, and an extra staff member was engaged. This situation was to continue until the late 1980s.

## 1984 - 1990
> The reforms of the 1984-90 Labour Government resulted in a major overhaul of the education system. The Education Act of 1989 abolished the UGC and the Department of Education, and set up the Ministry of Education and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. While all tertiary institutions were given more autonomy, the control of funding (delivered as a bulk fund based on Equivalent Full Time Students) was given to the Ministry.
> 
> As with many reorganisations at the time, several functions were left without a home and several them were given to the NZVCC, which was given additional resources by the universities to cope with the new responsibilities.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

> The responsibilities given to the NZVCC after the UGC was wound up included academic approval of new courses, standards for entrance to the universities and monitoring overall academic quality. Another function was to administer a range of scholarships—currently over 30 —which involved publicising the scholarships as well as the selection and award process.
>
> [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/about-university-sector/brief-history)

> Although the research funds administered by the UGC were not transferred to the NZVCC, the universities were keen to ensure that the research functions of the universities were not forgotten and established a research committee to develop policy on system wide issues.

# 1984-1990
## Fourth Labour Government
> New Zealand’s neoliberal restructuring as a whole began with the fourth Labour government in 1984, which espoused a focus on national economic recovery from the recent global recession. This project was continued into the 1990s by the subsequent National government. Characterised by mass privatisation and deregulation, the dismantling of the welfare state, and the reformation of public institutions through major funding cuts and introduction of user-pays models, the ‘New Zealand experiment’ was among the most early, rapid, and dramatic neoliberal reforms in the world at the time (Kelsey, 1997). The fallout, as canvassed comprehensively by Kelsey (1997), was widespread socio-economic inequity that disproportionately harmed working-class, Māori, and Pacific people, solidifying racialised discourse around poverty and continuing the colonial mission of systematic material and  cultural dispossession. Despite this infamously immediate catastrophic effect, neoliberal reform stayed its course, catalysing New Zealand’s shift into its current economic form (Kelsey, 1997; Shore, 2015). Like other public institutions, this neoliberal restructuring did not leave universities untouched (Shore, 2015; Shore & Davidson, 2014). In what follows, I chart the major moments in university reform for students specifically from 1984 to the present day to explore how neoliberal power has been diffused through New Zealand’s universities, producing neoliberal students and reinscribing neoliberal normativity.

## Overhaul: Labour
> When David Lange’s government was elected in 1984, the existing university management system reflected the educational philosophy it had espoused during its campaign (New Zealand Labour Party [NZLP], 1984). Each university12 was effectively an autonomous institution, all but entirely state-funded through the University Grants Committee (UGC) as a mediator between universities and the government. The UGC received an annual sum based on a five- year budget determined according to inflation and equivalent full-time students (EFTS), which it was to distribute between all universities through bulk funding according to student numbers and enrolment areas. The UGC was also responsible for managing the creation of new courses of study. The government managed universities’ investments (Snook, 1991). Student fees were low and existed only to cover student services, and a wide-sweeping grants system existed to support living costs for students funded by the government through progressive taxation (Roper, 2018). For the government, funding universities and students ensured that quality and accessible education was at the heart of state responsibility for reducing socio-economic inequality through upward mobility (NZLP, 1984). This position, however, was fairly short-lived.

## 1984
### Treasury’s 1984 Briefing to the Incoming Minister
> The Treasury’s 1984 Briefing to the Incoming Minister was the first document to hint at the government’s impending neoliberal turn. Suggesting that the new government explore new models of privatised higher education, the Treasury argued that public funding of universities for social reasons was misguided because the nature of higher education is inherently individual and economic: Strong social policy reasons cannot readily be established for the direct government supply of tertiary services largely free at the point of consumption… education choices at this level are discretionary investment or consumption decisions (that is, tertiary education is more a private than a public [^12] good), since the individual users capture most of the benefits of higher education. (New Zealand Treasury, 1984, p. 268) Explicitly including the neoliberal (re)definition of higher education as a private investment by an individual consumer rather than a public good, this discourse would shortly justify the introduction of neoliberal legislation that would, in turn, consolidate the naturality of this claim.
>
> [^12]: Seven at the time—AUT was a polytechnic until 2000.
> 
> **Jack (2023, p.39)**


## 1987
> In 1987, the Treasury’s briefing for the government’s second term made a vociferous recommitment to these neoliberal ideals and outlined a more detailed series of recommendations for transition. Most interestingly to this research, the document fleetingly notes that higher education enables graduates to integrate culturally and socially with groups desirable by the state, instilling within graduates a respectable “knowledge and style… norms, values, and personal contacts” (p. 162). Alongside the colonial undertones, this focus is emblematic of the new subjectifying role of a neoliberal university. However, the 1987 briefing’s primary occupation was the economic function of higher education. Indeed, it states that: Education can be analysed in a similar way to any other service in terms of interaction and exchange in the face of uncertainty, information costs, scarcity, interdependence and opportunism… education shares the main characteristics of other commodities traded in the market place. (New Zealand Treasury, 1987, p. 33) Once again, the Treasury engages in a market redefinition of higher education, and then proceeds to lay out a possible course of action. Noting that information and knowledge were “the fastest developing and increasingly central areas in the modern economy” (p. 195), the brief advocated for removing state intervention in universities on the basis that it would be more efficient and economically productive for institutions to manage themselves. Freedom from the state would ameliorate a national education supply and demand mismatch by enabling institutions to focus on enrolments in vocational courses (and non-compulsory near-vocational courses, such as commerce) and facilitate better marketing of a New Zealand higher education to international students. Here, a value difference is created between good, useful (market- oriented) study and less useful (less market-oriented) study. Reinforcing the individual economic benefits of (certain kinds of) higher education orients students towards universities through a market lens and also justifies a reduction in government funding, this feeding back into the notion of higher education as a purchasable investment in the self. By now self-appointed as Minister of Education, Lange publicly rejected the neoliberal stance of the Treasury captured by these briefings. [^13] 
> 
> [^13]: This public ideological stoush continued for years—in 1988, Lange stated that he “did not measure the Treasury’s position at all; there is no way at all in which you can be equitable and leave it to the market to determine educational access” (Lange, 1988, qtd. in Patterson, 1991, p. 57). 
> 
> **Jack (2023, p.40)**


### Watts report
> Ostensibly in response to the melee, the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ committee commissioned the 1987 Watts report, formally New Zealand's Universities: Partners in National Development (Olssen, 2002; Snook, 1991). The report argued that New Zealand’s universities were massively under-resourced and demanded more government funding (Olssen, 2002; Snook, 1991). However, its metric was the comparative financial performance of the universities of other OECD nations—thus, despite ultimately making recommendations counter to those of the Treasury, the report is self- contradicting in already accepting the commercial purpose of a university. As Olssen (2002) notes, the Watts report foreshadows the imposition of student fees, noting that if ascertaining the proportionate public and private benefits of higher education was to be difficult, fees may become justifiable. The introduction of fees is important to students for obvious reasons—once you purchase something, you are an invested consumer. Interestingly, the report also marks the first use of the public versus private good discourse to make actual policy recommendations. At the same time, the government was working on its own report.

## 1988
### Hawke Report
> In 1988, a working group presented Hawke’s [^14] Report on Post-Compulsory Education and Training in New Zealand to the Cabinet Social Equity Committee. Meant to review existing documents, the report instead built on the loose imperatives of the 1987 Treasury briefing to lay out stringent recommendations for increasing the contribution that universities could make to the national economy (Patterson, 1991). It made several recommendations, including proposing the establishment of a Ministry of Education and the consequent disestablishment of the UGC, which universities roundly critiqued as a mechanism to induce intra-sector competition for funding (Olssen, 2002; Patterson, 1991). In a similar vein, Hawke also suggests that universities should compete for higher proportions of private funding, commercialise aspects of research, appoint Vice-chancellors as CEOs, increase the use of charters, audits, and performance reviews for staff, and separate research and teaching. Neoliberal changes to the funding of universities like these would be necessary to corporatise the management and behaviour of universities. For students in particular, the report recommended increasing student fees and introducing a loan system. The Hawke report is the first to fully depict the contemporarily recognisable neoliberal form of New Zealand’s universities—commercialised and competitive institutions producing students as individualistic, entrepreneurial, and self-regulating future workers (Shore, 2015).

## 1989 & 1990
### Learning for Life I & II
> In 1989, two policy documents were released that would hone the Hawke report's recommendations and precede the Education Act 1989: Learning for Life I and Learning for Life II. Suggesting that the tertiary system was struggling because it was hyper-fragmented, the two documents together make two changes with particular implications for universities. First, the funding of universities, polytechnics, and wānanga, all of which had previously had individual systems, would be synthesised—the UGC would be abolished, universities would be bulk funded on a per-student basis untethered from inflation, and institutions would control their entire financial management. Second, Vice-Chancellors would become CEOs of universities defined by their research roles, the employer of all staff and themselves contracted to the Ministry of Education through a series of charters designed to concretise their responsibility to the state. In tandem, these would increase competition between all tertiary education institutions for students and funding—semi-privatisation and introducing competition was to be the cure for a disconnected sector. In order to maintain institutional viability and accountability to the state, universities would have to start selling themselves to students, making desirable promises in order to garner enrolments and, therefore, capital.
> 
> **Jack (2023, p.41)**

### Education Act 1989 & Education Amendment Act 1990
> The eventual Education Act 1989 consolidated some of the Learning for Life recommendations and introduced some means-testing to student support schemes (New Zealand University Students’ Association [NZUSA], n.d.). However, the Education Amendment Act 1990 was where the bulk of the changes listed in the paragraph above were enacted. The broad intent of the legislation was to streamline the national tertiary system, offering universities independence from the state conditional on their resource efficiency and accountability (Patterson, 1991). For students—continuing an emerging theme—the 1990 legislation also allowed for the introduction of course fees. The 1990 fee was $1250, and the percentage of this that would be paid corresponded to students’ parental income, though there was a minimum of 10%. Though the full fee is small by today’s standards,[^15] it amounted to a 1000% increase over a single year (Patterson, 1991; Snook, 1991; Roper, 2018). The introduction of high fees for tertiary study is widely regarded as the cornerstone technique for the positioning of higher education as a personal investment (Brooks et al., 2021; Krause- Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Lolich, 2011; Molesworth et al., 2009; Saunders, 2010; Shore, 2015). As the initiator of neoliberal reform, the government restructured individual universities into a corporate configuration, laying the neoliberal groundwork for the incoming National government to hone more precisely (Shore 2008; 2010). The new commercial structure of universities, alongside a more competitive funding model, necessitated that institutions compete for students by beginning to develop a recognisable brand and unique promises. However, the defining feature during this first stage of reform was the discursive redefinition of higher education as a private good, a personal investment. Though students have arguably always been treated in consumer-like ways by universities (Saunders, 2010), neoliberal reform presents the first explicit efforts to produce students in such a way where a consumer/service-provider relation to staff overrides the traditional mentee/mentor one (Ball, 2012; Ball & Olmedo, 2013; Giroux, 2014; Lolich, 2011; Saunders, 2010). Through discussing the purpose and outcomes of university study in financial terms, students are reoriented towards universities through market terms. The rational outcome of a cost/benefit analysis with regard to their future, going to university becomes a responsible use of the newfound freedom of neoliberalism—the acquisition of highly employable skills offers a leg-up towards securing high-income work, personal wealth, and the good life which comes with that (Brookes et al., 2021; Krause-Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Lolich, 2011; Shore, 2015).

> Kassim-Lakha notes (in Hoyt and Hollister 2014: 1695): ‘Universities have an obligation to share their intellectual material resources with their immediate community and not simply to co-exist with them’. This role is recognized in the New Zealand Education Act of 1989 (Ministry of Education 1989: 160), which sets out that universities and other tertiary education interests will operate in ‘the national interest’. The sharing of intellectual resources involves the dissemination of research beyond universities, but is also tied to the very nature of the institutions and the learning experienced within them. As Christopherson, Gertler and Gray (2014: 214) note, the collective and civic role of universities ‘is manifested in diverse scholarly research agendas. But this civic role is also enacted because universities are the place where young people from diverse backgrounds come together to learn from and about one another and craft routes to new social and political values and identities’. If these are the moral purposes of tertiary education and the modes of operation of universities, then it is crucial that there is equality of access to the social and material goods produced within universities. Equality of access is closely linked to the second moral principle advanced by Wright – democracy in the form of self-determination. If we agree that universities are sites where new social and political values are created, where social and political critiques are developed and where new knowledge is produced, then we will be concerned to ensure there is autonomy (for institutions) and freedom (for scholars and students). Academic freedom is recognized in the New Zealand Education Act of 1989 (Ministry of Education 1989: 161), which sets out the freedom of academics to ‘question and test received wisdom’, to ‘state controversial or unpopular opinions’ and to regulate what is taught and how achievement is to be assessed. What is refected here is that the development of sound critiques of ‘received wisdom’ can only come if scholars are separated from the political, social and economic elite of the day. Autonomy and academic freedom are not just crucial for academic staff; they are important for students as, ironically, while they are learning the rules and regulations of a discipline and are being prepared for a productive life in their society, they are also learning resistance. It is the fourth ‘R’, so to speak, the one that universities don’t like to address, and it makes an unruly subject (Edelman Boren 2001: 7).

## 1990
> Lincoln University (near Christchurch in the South Island) was established, although like Massey University, it has a long history. A School of Agriculture was set up in Lincoln in 1878 and in 1896, as the renamed Canterbury Agricultural College, was given the right to award degrees through the University of New Zealand.

> From the 1990s there has been an increase in line management within institutions and a ‘drift upwards’ in decision making from faculty to professional administrators (Gumport 2001 in Stewart 2010: 57). The ‘professionals’ interested in education are being dethroned in favour of ‘managers’ interested in ‘balanced books’ and ‘KPIs’(Karran 2007; Jones et al. 2012), though in New Zealand these are labelled educational performance indicators (EPIs) to make them appear more palatable. This is about reregulation, with tools such as performance development plans, staff satisfaction surveys, and research portfolios, creating a culture of performativity where the performance is measured against external benchmarks (Jesson 2012: 6).

## Settling In: National, 1990-1999
### The fourth National government, Ruth Richardson's 'mother of all budgets'
> The fourth National government, elected in 1990, accelerated and solidified New Zealand’s neoliberal restructuring. Finance Minister Ruth Richardson’s infamous ‘mother of all budgets’ was released in 1991, continuing the privatisation of state assets, dramatically slashing social welfare spending, and public institutions, including education, were fully introduced to the free market (Kelsey, 1997; Peters et al., 1992). In terms of higher education, the new government built upon the framework laid out by recent legislation and the Hawke report. Although the government would remain the primary financier of universities, it reduced this quite markedly, necessitating that universities turn towards private funding through ever-increasing fees and commercialisation. Forcing institutions to be more responsive to the market in this way was implemented to make universities more efficient and encourage their uptake of corporate managerialism (Olssen, 2002). Cost-cutting and uninhibited embrace of the free market were at the core of National’s tertiary policy.

## 1991
### National's Tertiary Review report
> In 1991, the government released its Tertiary Review report. With the government focused on reducing state expenditure and retreating from public institutions, predictably, the report’s recommendations revolved around student fees and loans. The previous government’s fees had already increased with the new year (Roper, 2018), but the report suggested a target for students to meet a minimum of 20% of their course costs but where institutions could set their own fees, coupled with the removal of the pre-existing means-tested allowance. Student allowances were to become strictly income-tested and age-restricted, and a student loan scheme was to be developed. To reduce welfare expenditure, universities would receive additional funding for enrolling students receiving state benefits. Loans were introduced as scheduled in 1992, resulting in around two-thirds of students taking on a loan almost immediately (Roper, 2018). Again, the introduction of a user-pays model of education is critical to solidifying higher education as a private investment, and the more expensive the initial investment is, the greater the perceived necessity to make it worthwhile (Brooks et al., 2021; Krause-Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Lolich, 2011; Molesworth et al., 2009; Saunders, 2010; Shore, 2015). Regardless of the introduction of fees and loans, the next few years saw unprecedented increases in tertiary participation (Olssen, 2002). The growing student numbers, counterproductively for the government, had meant a corresponding increase in government expenditure in real terms and an inefficient increase in staff workloads (Olssen, 2002). Arguably, it also reflects student buy-in to neoliberal constructions of higher education as a personal investment.

## 1994
### Todd taskforce’s Funding Growth in Tertiary Education and Training
> Thus, in 1994, the Todd taskforce’s Funding Growth in Tertiary Education and Training noted that because the direction of the global market meant that to participate, nationally or overseas, most citizens would need higher education, student course contributions should be raised to 25%. In doing so, an alternative model was rejected in which higher-income students would have paid higher fees to finance Māori and low-income student support. Though it had little material effect in its own right, this report evidences the complete turn away from the equity function of higher education, which was preeminent only a decade ago.

> **Jack (2023, p.43)**

## 1997
### A Future Tertiary Education Policy for New Zealand: Tertiary Education Review
> In 1997, the government released a Green Paper, A Future Tertiary Education Policy for New Zealand: Tertiary Education Review. This paper was a review that, yet again, focussed on managing fees and expenditure in response to increased demand, and it toyed with the idea of removing the EFTS cap to allow fees to rise and reduce real-terms government spending on university funding.

> **Jack (2023, p.43)**

## 1998
### Tertiary Education in New Zealand: Policy Directions for the 21st Century
> The White Paper, Tertiary Education in New Zealand: Policy Directions for the 21st Century (1998), was the final major report that consolidated the neoliberal transformation of New Zealand’s universities barely a decade after it began in earnest. The paper opens by claiming that “a well-performing tertiary sector will… improve New Zealand’s competitive edge, economic growth, employment opportunities, productivity, and social cohesion” (p. 4). Occupied with creating a system of financing and governance that would allow the efficient and productive function of universities in a global market, the paper signalled that the EFTS cap was to be removed, the government would partially subsidise tuition based on student numbers but students would largely fund their own “investment” (p. 55), and funding would be shared with private tertiary providers to increase competition. The White Paper performs the final stages of the corporatisation of universities and formalises the student-provider “contract” (p. 55) of higher education. The National government’s treatment of higher education finalised the vision of its predecessor, able to work with the understanding of higher education as a private good to fully marketise the sector (Shore, 2008, 2010). As scholars argue, neoliberalism proclaims the retraction of the state and so more autonomy for institutions, but instead utilises state power to facilitate the free operation of capital and perform more subtle control of institutions and the people subject to them. New Zealand’s universities, seemingly now free to manage themselves to excel in the free market, have their choices carefully regulated by neoliberal interests rather than being managed by the state in a more evident, top-down manner (Jakobsen, 2007; Olssen, 2002; Saunders, 2010). The effect is similar for students. Having been governed into a market orientation towards university through discourses of personal investment, this stage of neoliberal reform saw a consequent massification of university study and significantly increased student fees. If more students are investing in themselves through going to university, then new forms of competition and entrepreneurialism emerge as a means to gain competitive advantage. Moreover, as the size of the investment increases, the stakes of ensuring that it will provide worthwhile returns are heightened, producing competitive, entrepreneurial students who see those as a logical necessity and govern themselves accordingly (Beban & Trueman, 2018; Ball & Olmedo, 2013; Krause-Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Molesworth et al., 2009). In this way, though outwardly appearing to have more liberty over their own choices, these marketised students are enacting the interests of neoliberalism as if they are their own. New Normal: 2000-Present The neoliberal transformation of New Zealand through major legislation came to a halt around the turn of the millennium. New Zealand’s Universities, now governed by high-level administrative staff and with a greater obligation to serve the neoliberal interests of the state, private financiers, and students, had undergone a fundamental change in purpose (Olssen & Peters, 2005). Though the government continued to have a strong hand in managing New Zealand’s universities, this regulation was enacted through funding reallocations, policy, and minor legislative amendments that accrued little public interest outside university communities (Roper, 2018).

> **Jack (2023, p.43)**

# 2000 onwards

> At the beginning of the twenty-frst century, New Zealand’s universities are dominated by auditing and accountability measures which serve to discipline academic staff and students. Government-funding levers and policy directives are being used to ensure that universities support economic and labour market growth. This economic focus is constraining attempts to fulfl the socially progressive goals of universities at the very time when such projects are sorely needed. The picture is one of institutions and their academics being robbed of the space to be engaged in projects which are not countable, auditable, measurable or commercializable. Called by Winter (1991) the ‘new higher education’ environment, these symptoms are found in universities across the OECD most commonly under the banner of managerialism (Fredman and Doughney 2012; Lorenz 2012; Trowler 2001). The diffculty faced by academic staff and students alike is how to resist the myriad of managerial and auditing techniques infusing daily life in universities and narrowing the purpose of tertiary education.
>
> **Sandra Grey (2017, p. 275)**

> But over the last three decades successive New Zealand governments have sought to achieve a much closer alignment between the actions of tertiary education institutions and the goals of government (see, as an example, Ministry of Education 2008). Institutions must deliver material goods which generate a return for ‘NZ Inc’ (Jesson 2012; McLaughlin 2003; Zepke 2012).
> 
> The ‘steering’ over the last three decades has privileged commercial-
ization and corporatization in New Zealand’s tertiary education sector,
turning universities into tools for economic growth. This is refected in
the government strategy documents: 
> > There are three particular priorities that should shape the agenda for the sector: First is the drive to enhance New Zealand’s economic growth performance and raise labour productivity (Ministry of Education 2011: 3). [The goals are] … ensuring that the tertiary education system performs well, not just as its own system, but also as a part of the wider New Zealand economy … ensuring the system can adapt more quickly … addressing changing skill needs (Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and Ministry of Education 2014: 7).

> The Auckland University of Technology was established. Like Massey and Lincoln Universities it has a long history. Beginning life as the Auckland Technical School in 1895, in 1960 the secondary school and tertiary functions were separated, and the Auckland Technical Institute was set up. The Institute’s name was changed to the Auckland Institute of Technology in 1989 and changed its name again on 1 January 2000 when it gained university status.

## 2001
### Inquiry into Student Fees, Loans, Allowances and the Overall Resourcing of Tertiary Education
> In 2001, Labour established the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC). Influenced by the 2001 Inquiry into Student Fees, Loans, Allowances and the Overall Resourcing of Tertiary Education, TEAC instigated the write-off of student loan interest and the development of equity scholarships. Temporary fee stabilisation was also instituted (Roper, 2018). This development is particularly interesting because it suggests a return to focusing on equity of access just eight years after the Todd taskforce denigrated the idea, albeit within the established neoliberal framework.
> 
> **Jack (2023, p.45)**

## 2002
### Tertiary Education Commission, PBRF
> The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) replaced TEAC in 2002 at its own recommendation. The TEC is responsible for mandating periodic tertiary education strategies (TES) and monitoring the performance of tertiary education institutions. The inaugural TES (2002-2007) for students reiterated the importance of increasing participation and successful outcomes for Māori, Pacific, and low-income students, finalised the removal of loan interest for all students residing in New Zealand, but ended the fee freeze and instead allowing raises with limitations. Moreover, the introduction of the Performance Based Research Fund— critiqued as a surveilling practice of neoliberal managerialism (e.g. Cupples & Pawson, 2012)—placed new pressures and restrictions on staff, which solidified their service-provider relationship with students (Molesworth et al., 2009; Saunders, 2010; Shore, 2015). The TES (2007-2012) mirrored the vision of the first.

## 2006
> The problems in NHE have been well diagnosed internationally but we must continue to articulate them publicly so as to disrupt the power of NHE being taken for granted (Trowler 2001: 197). In New Zealand, for example, the Ministry of Education (MoE) states that the government’s approach, which links the ‘outputs’ of the tertiary education sector to goals of economic advancement and labour market productivity, is ‘accepted by the sector as the necessary way forward’ (Ministry of Education 2006: 17–18).
>
> Sandra Grey (2017, p. 278)

## 2008

> The ‘economic focus’ of government policy leads to a narrowing of who gets to study, where and when – a clear attack on the principle of equality. In an environment of fscal constraint, New Zealand’s National-Party-led government has decided to ‘target’ its investment on learners aged between eighteen and twenty-fve (New Zealand Treasury 2011: 21) to drive higher economic returns for the taxpayers’ investment in education (Ministry of Education 2008: 11). Steering ensures the ‘right’ students are admitted to tertiary study: ‘There is little value for anyone if learners enrol in tertiary provision that they are unlikely to complete, or which lacks a clear progression to higher-level study’ (Ministry of Education 2011: 30). Mature students and those studying part-time have been increasingly excluded from tertiary studies through changes to student fnancing policies. The impact is dramatic. In 2008, before the government narrowed student fnancial support rules, there were 33,009 students over fifty-five years old in New Zealand’s tertiary education system; by 2014 the number had almost halved, to 18,927 (Joyce 2015)
>
> **Sandra Grey (2017, p. 275)**

In New Zealand, the NHE agenda is based on short-term goals: ‘The focus [of the Tertiary Education Strategy] is much more explicitly on what the government expects the tertiary education system to contribute and the priority outcomes for the immediate future’ (Ministry of Education 2008: 4). Any future-oriented goals are inhibited by ‘austerity measures’ which have meant that fnancial resources in higher education are ‘more stringent and more contingent’ (Sharrock 2012: 324). In particular, the focus on mechanical effciency (the ratio of a system’s work output to its work input) (Lorenz 2012: 604) is undermining the sustainability of quality public tertiary education. For example, to cope with the cost of hiring additional senior staff to meet the mechanical effciency demands for more peer-reviewed publications, the Ministry of Education (2013) notes that New Zealand institutions have turned to using temporary and casualized contracts for low-level teaching academics in order to meet the rising student numbers that make up another mechanical effciency. This means that the university workforce profle in New Zealand is ageing and there are reduced opportunities for the quality mentoring and training of the next generation of academics.

### National reelected
> When National was re-elected amidst the global financial crisis in 2008, their policy forefronted austerity through a series of incremental but meaningful changes. Able to justify an unwillingness to provide any significant funding increases for universities because of the economic downturn, the TES (2010-2015) amounted to a real terms decline in EFTS funding and student financial support (Roper, 2018). In their second term, with a corresponding focus on economic recovery, the TES (2014-2019) pivoted to achieving the workforce development required for globally competitive economic growth—funding increases were frozen for humanities enrolments and increased for STEM enrolments. The document’s suggestion that “tertiary education provides individuals and communities with the opportunity to improve their own social outcomes by gaining the skills they need to become successful and productive citizens” (Ministry of Education, 2014, p. 7) maintains the neoliberal conception of higher education by students and engineers the devaluing of non-vocational study, binding the idea of a successful, fulfilling life to productivity and wealth. Moreover, the consequent restructuring of underfunded departments reinforced the need for staff to prioritise neoliberal drivers rather than pedagogical ones to remain employable, reproducing the consumer-student.

## 2011

> The changes with regard to who gets to study, what they study and where they study, has been accompanied by a narrowing of the research vision for New Zealand universities. A signifcant level of noncommercial research is carried out in universities in New Zealand but the government has made clear that it will ‘increase the incentives for research and tertiary education institutes to undertake more frm-relevant research and to transfer knowledge to frms’ (New Zealand Treasury 2011: 5). This narrow approach to research has been criticized by academics, including the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, Peter Gluckman: 
> > I think New Zealand has ended up with too much end user involve- ment in the contestable funding system, in the way it’s set forward, which has led to much more short-termism in some of our research (Gluckman 2015).
>
> Sandra Grey (2017, p. 280)


> The government’s approach to strategic planning and alignment of university outputs with government goals has also impacted upon another element of democracy – direct lobbying of the state with regard to the moral principles that should guide tertiary education policy and practice. Documentation from Universities New Zealand (the Vice Chancellors Committee) shows that the leaders of New Zealand’s universities are shying away from publicly ‘biting the hand that feeds them’. For example, the ‘Universities New Zealand Briefing:Contributing to Government Goals’ (Universities New Zealand 2011: 2) notes that universities are ‘uniquely well placed to partner with government in pursuit of these objectives [four government goals for the next four years]’. The focus on partnering with government to achieve economic outputs has become the dominant narrative in publicity releases of Universities New Zealand since 2008.2 Partnering with government, without setting clear moral principles for that partnership, is problematic for Universities New Zealand, as the NHE environment they are signing up to rules out of court any discussion about advancing the non-economic objectives of university activity.
>
> Sandra Grey (2017, p. 283)

> One of the interstitial spaces that must be used to transform higher education is in redefning who the university is. Over the last few decades, when speaking of ‘the university’, academics, students, politicians and the public are often referring to the brand of an institution. What are needed are actions which highlight that it is academics, staff and students who are the institutions (this is set out in New Zealand’s Education Act). Certainly this was at the heart of actions carried out in 2011 and 2012 by students at the University of Auckland. The students’ multiple actions included a blockading a road (to protest at the government’s budget and its lack of attention to the issue of student support) and occupying the university library to try to make real the catchphrase‘we are the university’ (Carlos and Cohn 2014). These actions by groups of students, with the support of a handful of academics, reclaim for a moment the civic focus of the university and the democratic ideals underpinning this.

### The Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Act
> As a surreptitious but effective means of cost-cutting across multiple fronts, the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Act 2011 [^16] introduced voluntary student union membership. The result was a massive decline in membership and a corresponding fall in union funding. Already financially precarious, the power of student unions as both advocacy groups and funders for other student organisations and services was undercut (Nissen & Hayward, 2016). Student groups vehemently opposed the bill, including queer students’ associations, who were aware that it would decrease their funding and thus the ability to organise community-building and political events on campus (GayNZ, 2010). The surgical dismantling of student collectivity, much like other union-busting activity, further individualises students and facilitates their further neoliberal regulation. In the wake of the bill being passed, the government slashed student allowance spending over the next five years and the loan repayment rate was increased, both with little meaningful opposition from increasingly atomised students (Nissen & Hayward, 2016).

> [^16]: Interestingly, the bill was sponsored by Roger Douglas, who was by this time a Member of Parliament for the ACT Party.
> 
> **Jack (2023, p.46)**

>  In New Zealand, the spaces for academic staff involvement in decision making have come under attack over the last three decades. Academics and students, and their representative unions, are seen as ‘vested’ interests, seeking special advantages or ‘privileges’ for themselves that are contrary to the public interest and to the long-term prospects of the country (Mulgan 2004; Olson 1982). Purging tertiary institutions of their ‘vested interests’ has meant dismantling collegiality and academic staff participation in decision making (see Russell 2007: 113). The most signifcant acts to purge the ‘vested interest’ from New Zealand’s tertiary education sector have been made under the current conservative National-Party-led government. The frst was the move to make student association membership voluntary in 2011. After decades of compulsory student association membership, students now had to ‘opt in’ to the student association but they still had to pay the student services levy to their institutions, which was then ‘redistributed’ to service providers (often the student association). This move has decimated student activism on university campuses.

## 2012
> From time to time the ongoing attacks on the autonomy of universities have erupted publicly. For example, when the University of Auckland’s vice chancellor questioned the targeting of funding to engineering places, following the 2102 budget, and suggested that the institution would not strictly follow the rules set out, the response from the government was swift. The Minister for Tertiary Education Steven Joyce retorted: ‘If they want us to be more directive, I’m more than willing’ (see Collins 2012). This type of response has meant any challenge to the Minister’s approach for targeting in the sector has been short-lived.

## 2013
> New Zealand’s university staff are acutely aware of this reregulation and its disempowering effect. This was evident in a 2013 survey on the state of the tertiary education sector in New Zealand, completed by 2,931 academic and general staff working in the sector. A clear majority of respondents (88 percent) agreed with the statement that there was a top-down style of management at their institutions, with only 36.4 percent agreeing that there was a climate of collegiality in decision-making processes (Bentley, McLeod and Teo 2014: 14). Participants noted that: ‘Top-down hierarchical management is increasingly autocratic in its decision making process’ and ‘[s]enior staff and divisional heads actively clamp down on staff initiative, and do not let us lower creatures do anything without checking with them a million times’ (ibid.: 14). The 2013 survey also illustrated the impact of the managerial processes on ‘self-determination’: 39 percent of academic staff reported that their level of academic freedom was worse to some degree than when they joined the sector, and 41.9 percent said their opportunity to act as critic and conscience had declined (Bentley, McLeod and Teo 2014: 13). The ‘conformism’ and ‘constraint’ expressed in these survey results are evidence of how self-determination (democracy) is under strain due to both government policy approaches and managerial directives. As Marilyn Strathern noted: ‘The auditing of research and teaching outputs of universities promotes a standardization and normalization of practices fostering conformity which has direct consequences, and for many dire ones, for intellectual production’ (quoted in Dew 2004: 188).

> the viable alternatives for tertiary education in New Zealand must be ones which defend equality, self-determination and sustainability. From the perspective of both TEU members and the New Zealand Union of Student Associations (NZUSA), the only viable alternative is one which is publicly funded and controlled. It does not take long to fnd this within the core claims of both student and academic staff associations. For example, the TEU document ‘Te Kaupapa Whairoanga’, sets out a clear vision for tertiary education: 
> > We assert that tertiary education is a public good – the system belongs to all of us, we all contribute to it, and we are all responsible for it. Access to life-long learning in publicly funded tertiary education institutions is a basic right for all New Zealanders (Grey, Sedgwick and Scott 2013).
>
> Sandra Grey (2017, p. 285)


> The New Zealand Education Act (1989) gives academics the right to challenge their own institution’s actions and policies. That same legislation also means that academic staff can reject the privatization of research by reclaiming and defending their place in public debate. The importance of the role of academics and students in public debate has led to the creation of Academic Freedom Aotearoa in 2013.3 Academics at the University of Auckland have set up a group to educate and train colleagues in their fundamental role of acting as the critic and conscience of society.
>
> Sandra Grey (2017, p. 289)

## 2014

> New Zealand academics can use their teaching spaces for generating agency for students. For example, debating with students about the collective rights and responsibilities encompassed in the critic and conscience function is a way of challenging the NHE environment and the economic focus imposed by government policy. This conversation can have surprising effects. In 2014, after discussing the importance of acting as the critic and conscience of society, students in a third-year social movement course at Victoria University of Wellington set up a new activist group – ‘Reclaim Vic’ – and organized ‘illegal’ demonstrations in the university’s student hub. The university required any group using the hub to seek the permission of the institution and to pay a bond, something the students rejected as evidence of how education had been commercialized and privatized.
> 
> Similarly, while government measures affect the operations of universities, academic members of staff have the agency to resist some of the trends. One is the commodifcation of our students and the transformation of them from students to ‘consumers’. Classrooms are still a domain in which academics and other teaching staff have considerable agency. It is a space that can be used to highlight to students that the public in New Zealand still pays for nearly three quarters of the cost of their education. A space in which academic staff can talk through and negotiate the social contract between student and teacher, student and the that fund them, and so on. A space in which we can acknowledge the crippling student debt generated by NHE policies, but also ensure that students see their role in higher education as being one of learning, not merely gaining a credential.

## 2020
### The Education and Training Act 2020
> The Education and Training Act 2020 marked little change for tertiary education specifically. The legislation all but directly incorporated the Education Act 1989, except to give Te Tiriti o Waitangi greater effect and enable easier prosecution of student loan offences. The former decree is reflected in the current TES (2020), which prioritises Māori equity strategies, the incorporation of te reo and tikanga Māori into institutions, and the development of mātauranga Māori, alongside a host of other inclusion and anti-discrimination goals. The prominent focus on diversity and inclusion in the current TES, particularly for Māori and Pacific students, is especially notable. Every TES to date notes the importance of increasing Māori and Pacific student participation rates and post-study market participation, presenting Māori and Pacific students as a grouped market failure that could be remedied through higher education. The TES 2020 is the first to present a mechanism for doing so—in the first four TESs, mention of diversity or inclusion happens only three times across all reports as part of an objective or mission statement relative to students. The sudden pivot to diversity discourse calls to mind Ahmed (2012, 2015), who explains how institutions use diversity to manage minority groups and prioritise non-transformative change with market benefits for the institution over creating equitable universities. In this way, the neoliberal production of marketised students also appears to have a racialised element. Most students entering New Zealand’s universities from the late 2000s onwards have “grown up neoliberal” (Beban & Trueman, 2018, p. 106), the idea that higher education is a self-investment to be purchased as a key to the good life more a natural fact than a new and imposed idea. With that market orientation maintained through ever-growing fees, the majority of tertiary policy over the last two decades has focused largely on the corporatisation of New Zealand’s universities to enhance the global competitiveness of the national economy in the interests of capital. It has been the (preordained) responses to these policies by individual institutions that have shaped student subjectivity into its present-day form. Specifically, changes in government priorities driven by both austerity and economic recovery induce institutional restructuring, which takes shape around funding allocations. This adjustment has multiple effects. Namely, redundancies increase staff-to-student ratios through larger class sizes and the employment insecurity of staff encourages a marketised pedagogy (Krause-Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Molesworth et al., 2009; Saunders, 2010). In turn, classes become more impersonal, and the use of standardised assessment and student ranking as a way of evidencing the success of a course grows. Made hyper-aware of their peers, of whom there are many, and their achievements, students become increasingly competitive and self- interested in pursuit of maximising returns on their investment (Ball, 2012; Beban & Trueman, 2018; Krause-Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Shore, 2015). In this regard, students choose extracurriculars for their social and cultural capital to enhance their unique employability, entrepreneurs assembling a market identity (Breathnach, 2014; Varman et al., 2011). [^17] The financial support and the prestige—the proof of hard work—of highly limited but highly desired performance-based incentives like excellence scholarships only reinforce these relations of competition and individualism (Krause-Jensen & Garsten, 2014; Lolich, 2011; Molesworth et al., 2009; Saunders, 2010). When the government designates particular kinds of study as valuable (profitable) and others as not so, with a financial imperative attached, the response of universities is to protect their financial viability as a business, thus reinscribing neoliberal discourses. In this way, neoliberal universities prepare students for the market by producing good, self-governing market actors. These outcomes are maximised by the disassembling of student solidarity. The financial strangulation of student unions means that only societies and activities that are economically self-sufficient or highly profitable are viable as budgets tighten (O’Hagan Brebner, 2021). Nissen and Hayward (2016) note that as a result, student unions must market themselves towards either their university or private donors in order to acquire funding, and as a result, “the goals of the association must be aligned with those of the commercialised university” (p. 139). In turn, the kinds of clubs and events that manage to sustain themselves are usually those which align with the market interests of the university, and increasingly, this is what students are coming to desire, too. Students, therefore, have less opportunity to form community around shared experiences in general, and any student community-building tends to coagulate around a market interest (Nissen & Hayward, 2016). Further, this lack of student solidarity and collective politics reduces the potential for organising against attacks on student well-being (Nissen & Hayward, 2016; Roper, 2018).

## 2023
> In 2023, New Zealand’s universities are in crisis. Hundreds of redundancies have been announced across the sector, more loom, and entire departments are being cut or drastically restructured (Heagney, 2023). An emergency stimulation package announced by the government is expected to have little preventative effect (Tertiary Education Union [TEU], 2023). Universities and the government have blamed the COVID-19 recession for declining enrolments and an inability to increase funding (McNeilly, 2023). However, the TEU has drawn attention to the preceding decades of systematic underfunding and neoliberal governance canvassed above—between 2009-2018, cumulative tertiary underfunding amounted to an estimated $3.7 billion (Roper, 2023). The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) and Te Mana Ākonga have also connected these issues to neoliberal governance outside of tertiary education. With the phasing in of first-year free fees from 2018 unmatched by a sufficient increase in living support, inflation and a pre-existing housing crisis have ballooned living costs beyond sustainable levels for many students (NZUSA et al., 2022; Shaw, 2017). The treatment of students by universities during the pandemic lockdowns has also drawn ire, contributing to a sense of feeling undervalued for students (NZUSA et al., 2022). It seems that neoliberal universities may have dug their own grave—in a sector where the last four decades have instilled the primacy of higher education as an individual investment towards the good life, the production of neoliberal subjects appears to have been so effective that New Zealand’s universities simply cannot treat their customers well enough or offer a quality product such that students are taking their business elsewhere. A detailed understanding of how students have been and are governed into neoliberal subjectivity is critical to exploring student experiences of universities, particularly as the institutions themselves teeter on the precipice.
