title: Leaking Information
slug: leak
---

Lack of transparency, use of obfuscating language, and the suppression of information is used by management to hinder accountability and impede the ability of staff and students to make informed decisions. Leaking information exposes wrongdoing, promote transparency, and holds our institutions accountable. 

Leaking information have risks, including legal consequences and personal repercussions. However there are strategies to mitigate discovery or allow others to take the burden.

Quick tips:
- Leaking doesn't always have to be secret information, it can just be something that is not widely known, or not known to the right people.
- Leaks from staff are one of the only ways students can find out what is happening in their institution (AUSA doesn't share much).
- Do not use work email or devices to leak information.
- You can use social media, forums, or email to leak information, but be cautious of metadata or connections to your online identity.
- Use of [Official Infomation Act (OIA)](https://fyi.org.nz) requests can expose information and protect the leaker.
- You are welcome to meet up in person to share information.
- Verify the accuracy of the information before leaking. Inaccurate information can undermine credibility and cause harm.
- Alternatively provide the limitations of your knowledge or the information you are sharing - rumor is okay if it is clear that it is a rumor, this can impower us to investigate further.

## Academic Freedom
Students and staff are protected by the Education Act 2020, which enshrines academic freedom, protecting the freedom of academic staff and students to engage in research. If you would like to participate in research about the university, you are protected by this act. [Many people at the University of Auckland study and have ongoing research projects about universities](/scholars).
