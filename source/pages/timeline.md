title: Timeline of University Student Activism in Aotearoa NZ
slug: timeline
---

This timeline is a work in progress. If you have any information or resources to contribute, please [get in touch](/contact).

The timeline only focuses on university centered issues, such as governance, funding, access, equity, investments, student accomodation, university services, and the role of universities in society. 
While all struggles are interconnected, the scope of this timeline must have a clear focus, therefore, it does not include issues that are not specifically related to universities, such as climate change, non-student housing, or healthcare.
