The New Zealand Journal of Tertiary Education Policy is intended to provide a forum where issues concerning tertiary education in Aotearoa/New Zealand can be expressed, discussed and debated.
The Journal welcomes submissions concerned with policy development (broadly conceived), and its application and critique; submissions analysing strategic developments within tertiary education in New Zealand and in relation to developments internationally; and submissions focussed on the contribution of tertiary education in New Zealand to national development and public life.

The Journal will strive to address issues of particular interest to AUS members, but contributors are free to express their own views, and are not constrained by any expressed AUS policies or positions.

The Journal is available in pdf format. Please follow the links below for recent issues:
