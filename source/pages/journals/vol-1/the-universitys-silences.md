French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu argues that power lies in things that ‘go without saying because, being axiomatic, they come without saying’ (Comaroff 1997).
The creeping neoliberalisation of Auckland university has, to a large extent, gone without saying. But the We Are The University movement is attempting to open up discus- sion in a wider forum than ever before around the fundamental shifts in the university’s structure, purpose and self-image.

When the government claims that universities must do more to ‘meet the needs of the economy’, what’s gone without saying is that the university has a responsibility to the economy in the first place. That the foundational principle of the university as ‘critic and conscience’ of society has been slipping away, unnoticed, in favour of a new one:

the university as an arm of the national economy. What’s gone without saying, too, is the notion that everything that can help the economy has the duty to do so. The fact that the university holds huge commercial potential has been conflated with the normative claim that it should use this. But the latter is an ideological decision, not a fact of nature. It is intentional, not inevitable.

When Stuart McCutcheon says that ‘the University should be able to determine its own policies, as most organisations do’, what’s gone without saying is just who the ‘Uni- versity’ really is in this sentence. This ‘University’ McCutcheon talks about is himself and his managers, who can change policies regardless of the opinions of academics, treated merely as ‘employees’. It is not, at present, a community of students and academics – and the university’s governance structure reflects this. The pay structure makes it laughable. After treating himself to a pay rise equivalent to the entire annual salary of a staff member, McCutcheon is now the third-highest paid public sector employee in New Zealand.

When student loans are defended on the basis of them being interest-free, what has gone without saying is that education is no longer a public good, but a private invest- ment. This contains further fundamental assumptions within it. One is that education is above all about integrating students into society as it stands, by equipping us with the right skills and attitudes to be ‘successful citizens of the 21st century’. What it hides is the other possibility, that the university can in fact be a place where alternative visions of society are imagined, and the status quo questioned.

When university is dominated by a discourse of ‘excellence’, ‘quality’, and ‘best practice’ but these terms are strangely empty of meaning, what has gone without saying is that no one is saying anything anymore. The management structures, performance indicators, accountability measures – all rationalities that have travelled from the financial sphere into some thing quite different – have overtaken the very content of learning, teaching, and research.

And when academic research is measured against uniform sets of indicators, when regimes of standardisation are extending their reach into not just universities or secondary schools but primary schools, what has gone without saying is that judgment has been re- placed by measurement, and knowledge by information. What was never said was the way ‘learning may manifest itself weeks, years, generations, after teaching, and may manifest itself in forms that do not look like the original at all’ (Strathern 2000). What was never said was that we can’t measure learning or thinking within a set of preordained standards be- cause a major function of these is, by definition, to find things that we never knew existed.

It is not easy to challenge these ideas, because they come to us through an impen- etrable discourse of economic rationality. They present themselves as self-evident. This is why, as Bourdieu continues, power ‘lies in what it silences, what it prevents people from thinking and saying, what it puts beyond the limits of the rational and the credible.’ Like in the war that is fought on a cost-benefit calculation, precluding any discussion of morality, it is more often than we’d like to admit that we can forget about things like collegiality, and trust, because they lie outside of these discourses.

The We Are The University movement is about much more than fees, or VSM, or supporting academic rights. It is about starting to question the fundamentals of what a university should be. We need to start articulating the problems in new ways, and thinking hard about the meaning and role of this institution. There is nothing neutral or inevitable about the neoliberalisation of the university. We need to make sure this is not something that just never gets said.
